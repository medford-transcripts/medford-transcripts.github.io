    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=1623.62s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I find them in order and I move for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=1757.683s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=1758.483s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We had another long, substantive conversation on the draft proposals for Medford Square, West Medford Square, and the draft updates to the ADU's ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=1768.745s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We reported them out of committee, and later tonight, they will be up for a vote to refer to the Community Development Board for further discussion in public hearings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=1776.846s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Move for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=4774.11s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=4774.931s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for outlining the steps that this proposal will take after a vote to refer it out to the Community Development Board this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=4784.838s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just to quickly recap the steps that have been taken to get us to this point, like all proposals that have been generated in our comprehensive zoning overhaul this year, or this term, rather,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=4799.449s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, these proposals, the zoning proposals for West Medford Square, Medford Square, and updates to our ADU's regulations were all developed in the Planning and Permitting Committee, um, with committee members, the zoning consultant, Innes Associates, and, um, city staff members of the Planning Development and Sustainability Department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=4821.716s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We met on this proposal three times between March and April.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=4826.401s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We had a public Q&A on the three proposals last week after they're referred out of the City Council this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=4834.63s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They will then begin the public hearing process before the Community Development Board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=4838.714s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So far in the process, the Community Development Board has been<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=4842.778s">[Kit Collins]</a>: taking their time to hold as many hearings on the zoning topics as they have felt the need to, which I think is great and I'm sure they will continue to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=4849.927s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That is another opportunity for community members to ask questions and give comment on these proposals as they have been doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=4858.697s">[Kit Collins]</a>: when these proposals were in the planning and permitting committee as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=4862.781s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So there has been a lot of discussion of these specific proposals themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=4867.425s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In committee, there will be a lot more discussion about the specifics of the proposals in CDB when they're gone into in-depth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=4874.851s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I won't do that yet again here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=4876.873s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But if folks want to learn more about these proposals before the CDB public hearings, there is a lot of information<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=4885.0s">[Kit Collins]</a>: on the city zoning website medfordma.org slash zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=4891.303s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I encourage all residents to continue to be involved in the planning and permitting committee process and to attend the CDP public hearings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=4899.526s">[Kit Collins]</a>: With that, I would motion to refer the three proposals to the Community Development Board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=10544.952s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you president bears I think all of the important points have been stated already but I was present at this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=10550.517s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Talked about it with Chief of Staff Nazarian and Director McDermott and they emphasized that this was really just a targeted change to make sure that visitors to City Hall and City Hall employees can access the parking that they need to go to City Hall and do business and go to their jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=10566.61s">[Kit Collins]</a>: not intended to be punitive and the committee did ask for a guarantee that it wouldn't just be all of a sudden tickets are being issued there's going to be a substantial you know informational period and warning period and issuing warnings before they start doing enforcement related to fines so really not intended to be punitive just want to make sure that people who need to park at city hall are able to do so and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=10591.62s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the large amount of public parking that is next to that lot is still, for the moment, public parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=10597.762s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=12262.506s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bearson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=12263.607s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, it's a difficult topic to bring up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=12266.468s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I thank the president for bringing it up, continuing to bring it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=12271.451s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Speaking for only myself as one Councilor, this is something that is obviously, I'm sure I'm not speaking only for myself when I say this is something that is extremely preoccupying to many of us right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=12281.797s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we're in uncharted territory relating to how a local government can and should respond<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=12290.622s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=12292.524s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But what I think is unacceptable would be to say, because this is uncharted, we have no agency to chart our own path here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=12299.469s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That would at least be unacceptable to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=12301.791s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that the work ahead of us right now collaboratively throughout the entire government of the city of Medford is to craft a policy collaboratively so that we can all be sure that we are doing what we can to make sure that public safety in Medford<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=12317.443s">[Kit Collins]</a>: is in every way directed towards public safety in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=12320.864s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And some of our very most initial conversations about this, obviously, it's a fraught topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=12325.025s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I really think that everybody's intentions about this are good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=12328.826s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think that we have to keep in mind that a response can look like a lot of things and be more helpful than what it is right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=12337.789s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that there is a very... I think that, you know, it's kind of trite,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=12347.332s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Inaction is action, and I think that's what we have to be wary of when it comes to what we are declining to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=12352.874s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When it comes to our response to ICE and other federal agencies in Medford, we can't just do nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=12358.575s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's obviously insufficient.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=12359.815s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think the resident said that very well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=12362.456s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Right now, we have a lot of ordinary residents in the community that are taking on the work of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=12371.042s">[Kit Collins]</a>: figuring out what public safety looks like in this time when federal agents are coming into our community, barely letting even our chief of police know, certainly not letting other city leaders such as ourselves know, being in public property, being on residential streets, masked, unidentified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=12387.091s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's residents taking on the onus of saying, hey,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=12392.834s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Who are you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=12393.615s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What are you doing here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=12394.376s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is this okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=12396.318s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This seems suspicious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=12397.198s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let's make sure the people in the neighborhood are okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=12399.701s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Because our local government has not taken on the onus of doing that community safety work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=12405.166s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that needs to change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=12406.167s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we need to share that responsibility with the community, obviously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=12409.81s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we share the responsibility of, if ICE has been present in the community,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=12415.135s">[Kit Collins]</a>: using our official channels and our official power to say, what comes next now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=12419.519s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What do people need now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=12420.48s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are people good?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=12421.121s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What do they need?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=12421.721s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Do they know their rights?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=12424.084s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is there support that's needed in the wake of being visited by ICE?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=12429.308s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it goes further than that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=12430.61s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But what I think is really unacceptable is to say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=12434.353s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Our responsibility is to do nothing and pretend that that's enough, because it obviously isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=12438.776s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I thank community members for leading the way here, and I feel resolute that, frankly, city leadership needs to follow in the footsteps of residents who are already doing the work of figuring out what community safety looks like in this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=12453.407s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So the conversation has to continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1jzPrb1DFs&t=12455.228s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1250.99s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1251.451s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Wait.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1252.512s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Enable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1253.053s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Takes me a while, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1253.954s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Gotcha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1254.395s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1255.016s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1256.208s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for being here, Chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1257.129s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Nice to see you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1258.329s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to thank you for your efforts in putting together the annual surveillance report and for your whole team, which for one, I'm sure was a collaborative effort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1267.112s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As was stated, this is the first annual surveillance report that we're getting on the body-worn cameras program for a full year of usage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1273.075s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When we spoke last year, I think it was just about like a month of 2023 that they had been in operation for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1278.057s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This one is different in that we're<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1281.77s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Glad that we're really sinking our teeth in on this one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1283.831s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's good to be able to see a full year's worth of reflections and data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1289.295s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For folks who are just tuning in for the first time, I just want to set some context.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1295.399s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is the annual recording that we get on body-worn cameras.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1300.402s">[Kit Collins]</a>: through to year 2028.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1302.042s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Ordinarily, surveillance technology undergoes a use policy and impact report process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1308.304s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Body-worn cameras were exempted from that through 2028.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1310.304s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think this makes this an all the more valuable part of this process, because this is our opportunity to discuss and to learn and to talk about those topics, which would otherwise we'd have several conversations about and several documents about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1329.554s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also just feel it's important to state that in terms of the goals of this ordinance that this report falls under, to me as one Councilor, it's more important than ever to be having these conversations, and it's more important than ever to be refocusing on the goals behind all of the reporting and all of the conversations under the CCOPS ordinance, which is to make sure that residents in Medford are informed of what surveillance is going on in our community, to make sure that they have all of the information that they need about surveillance technologies that are approved in our community,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1359.581s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And to make sure that we are all of us as city leaders very aware of protocols and the policies to keep that information surveillance data secure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1370.642s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's important all the time, as we discussed a lot over the past couple of years, lots of security risks, cybersecurity concerns to take into account when we're talking about surveillance technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1380.59s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And in these times when we know that there are other jurisdictions active and present and working in Medford, I think it's all the more incumbent on us to make sure that we're getting good information out to Medford residents and being really aware of what our policies are for keeping a very, very tight lid on the surveillance technology and data that we do have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1398.825s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and staying really clear on those policies that make sure that we're only collecting the surveillance data that we absolutely need for local public safety goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1406.707s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I just feel that that's important to state at this time, especially just a couple days after ICE was in Medford, again, for federal agendas that may or may not be related to local public safety goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1422.472s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Having said that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1426.703s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Like I said, this is the second annual surveillance report that we've looked at on body-worn cameras.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1431.767s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do just want to be transparent as we're talking about the guidelines of the report and state per the ordinance, we're supposed to receive the annual surveillance report by March 15.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1442.735s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We got this one on April 24.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1445.157s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Going forward, I think it's really helpful for us to get it by the first quarter so that we can have more time earlier in the year to review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1452.462s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I hope that next year we can be more familiar with the cadence of reporting on a full year of body worn camera usage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1463.03s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1463.651s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1467.838s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's very useful to be able to look through a report, very thorough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1470.361s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And speaking of, you know, the scope of the report, a lot of what is in there in my read is, you know, I'm more familiar with the ordinance than most because I drafted a lot of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1481.832s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A lot of what is in the report is critical information, well organized, asked for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1485.796s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There are some areas where those statistics are not asked for by the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1491.702s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think they can be valuable to be in there, but just in case that is inflating the scope of work, I just do want to clarify that mention of specific, some of the statistics that mention specific people requesting special notification forms or specific officers involved in certain reporting requirements, that's not asked for in the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1513.7s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So if that is inflating the scope of work, if that added to the timeline issues, that's actually not necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1520.185s">[Kit Collins]</a>: just wanted to take this opportunity to clarify that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1522.387s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Not an issue, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1523.168s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1523.848s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then I think that there are some other, I'm sure we'll talk a lot more about the results of the internal audit later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1528.572s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think there are some other areas we're going forward would be helpful to have more detail and more of a story attached to those results of the internal, the results of the internal audits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1542.452s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And again, I had a couple quick I had a couple questions most relating to the results of the internal audits, but before I get further on that I just wanted to mention that again this is for folks who haven't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1554.045s">[Kit Collins]</a>: tuned into meetings about this particular ordinance before, so folks can know we're talking about the goals of the annual surveillance report, and this is true of any surveillance technology administered by any city, any department or agency in the city, is to provide a high level and generalized summary of the policies and usages concerning the surveillance technology, how it's been used, if the user feels it has been effective, which the chief has stated he believes that it has,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1578.311s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1578.791s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um whether and how often surveillance data was shared with external persons or entities, the number of public records requests received by the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1586.353s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Summary of any complaints or concerns that were received about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1589.754s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The results of any audits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1592.075s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Whether the civil liberties and civil rights of any communities of groups in the city of being or have been disproportionately impacted by the use of the surveillance technology estimate of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1606.599s">[Kit Collins]</a>: with entities outside of the city relating to that data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1611.123s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And the report covered all of those topics, some more detailed than others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1614.825s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you for that thoroughness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1621.231s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Most of my specific questions for you, Chief and to your team related to the results of the internal audit on the body worn cameras and I appreciated the clarity around, there was an audit for use, and then an audit for access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1635.206s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1635.987s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for breaking it down that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1642.142s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And if I'm interpreting the report correctly, there was a random sampling that the internal audit drew from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1648.606s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think in terms of the use audit, the biggest thing that jumped out to me was that it seemed like, in aggregate, in one in three cases, the officer did not advise all of the residents in their vicinity that they were being recorded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1661.833s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that jumps out to me as the biggest red flag.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1664.715s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's a pretty high number to be deviating from the policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1667.697s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm curious if you can fill out that picture with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1672.099s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What do you think isn't getting across what specific training is planned to make sure that we get that up to 99.9% instead of 33?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1678.045s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1762.293s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1762.933s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1764.214s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I can understand it's a lot of footage to sift through to run down every individual case of, oh, did this person not say it because somebody, three officers ahead of them did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1774.419s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that is important information for us to have because the goal of this is to have an accurate picture of how effective is that training and really what is that number of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1784.184s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are there residents who aren't being informed that they're being surveilled?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1787.205s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know that everybody's picking this up as fast as they can, but especially in these times, it's very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1793.206s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you for your efforts and making sure that the officers who need a reminder are getting reminders, but this is an issue of critical importance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1834.218s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, well, that's good to hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1835.079s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's very good to hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1838.083s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for that context.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1838.964s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1840.807s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I noted that there were also statistics on when officers either failed to start or failed to stop the recording, whether it was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1852.922s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You get to an incident, you forget to turn it on right at the start or you leave an incident and you forget to turn it off so maybe they're walking down the street walking to their cruiser.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1861.125s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Could you speak a little bit more to cases like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1937.47s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Gotcha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1938.71s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I can see how that could be a blurry line sometimes of when does the episode end?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1958.236s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1958.817s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1959.697s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In cases where I'm curious, have cases come up where an officer forgot to stop the recording, and they didn't just get in the cruiser, they were out in the street scene, non-involved people are captured<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1972.317s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that you came across in your audit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=1973.758s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My concern is a camera not stopping and then people being surveilled who are just, you know, walking to Duncan going on the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2003.612s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2004.072s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2004.612s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And the intent of my question is just, obviously, I think we're all very lasered in on wanting to make sure that there's not superfluous surveillance of people going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2013.676s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that's the intent behind the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2015.557s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Glad to hear that that hasn't come up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2017.918s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2018.339s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2019.759s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2020.059s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2022.221s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This might be more of a Chief Buckley question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2026.818s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If you could just speak a little bit more to the purchase of the additional cameras and the equipment that was made last year, was that just to outfit more officers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2034.744s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Was that to replenish equipment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2056.478s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2069.31s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is it current policy that any officer out in the community will be outfitted with a camera?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2076.597s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2077.278s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2095.654s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2095.954s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2097.635s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2099.375s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is there anything more that you can share?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2103.057s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Given that these have been in use for, I was going to say, 13 months, but more than that now, coming up on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2109.716s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, getting close to two years of usage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2111.377s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm curious if there are any updates to the outfitting and training protocols, given that the department now has more experience with both using them and with training officers to use them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2123.602s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Have there been any changes to the training protocol as we've spent more time with these?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2217.719s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Gotcha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2218.26s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2218.8s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I can understand that would multiply the work significantly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2221.662s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it could be interesting, maybe this would be a useful part of the narrative for next year's reporting, is not to apply that auditing scheme to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2231.705s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to every interaction that you do audit, but just one or two to say, can we verify in this case, was it really just that they already heard somebody say it to try to identify if there are gaps there or if it can be perhaps a little bit more confidently attributed to somebody else got to it first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2252.498s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2253.259s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In your experience, I know that you've said a lot of this is muscle memory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2255.94s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It takes time to get used to using these and used to the protocols.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2262.154s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In your experience, and I'm talking high level here, do you see officers getting more comfortable and getting more accustomed to saying the disclaimer over the course of the year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2270.637s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know this report is kind of a snapshot of the full year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2274.438s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Do you feel that January to December officers are improving at the disclaimer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2342.388s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, thank you for your fairness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2394.35s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Understandable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2395.391s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I appreciate both of your attention to this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2398.315s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And obviously, you know, my take on it, I think it's really important that we do that disclaimer every single time in addition to all of the other essentially security protocols that are baked into this policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2408.267s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So appreciate your commitment to making sure that we get better and better at those as time goes on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2413.853s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2414.713s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just my last question for right now, most of my questions are around the use audit relating to the access audit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2420.316s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It seemed like there was much fewer issues that popped up in that one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2425.198s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is there any, can you just fill in the picture a little bit for us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2429.679s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know it's the only, the higher level officers that would be accessing videotape in any case, and that would be only if in the event of a specific trigger, if there's a specific reason or justification for them to be using that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2441.224s">[Kit Collins]</a>: for them viewing that video footage, could you speak a little bit to how that audit worked with the access audit and any findings or updates to trainings that you're planning?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2582.348s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2583.129s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2583.489s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2583.789s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And of course, with all of these questions, it's not a line of query is not about any sort of bad faith from the force, but rather wanting to make sure that there are these really secure protocols and just giving the city council a chance to hear what are the security measures that are in place?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2598.676s">[Kit Collins]</a>: How are they being enforced and maintained?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2601.558s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2601.998s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2602.199s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll probably have more later, but I think that's it for me for now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2604.28s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3843.433s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3845.896s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just to follow up on that, and I think this is probably implied in what you just said, but since the report that we're looking at today covers 2024 and not January through May of this year, have any federal agencies requested surveillance data that was captured in 2025 that wouldn't have been captured in this report?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3913.4s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3914.14s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's good to have confirmed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3916.041s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And not to belabor the point I know we have folks in the audience who also wanted to speak to the matter at hand but since Councilor Tseng brought it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3926.046s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate the candor about this chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3931.119s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, it's troubling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3931.92s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that we're all troubled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3933.261s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We all share in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3934.522s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do think that we need to honestly have more of a discussion about what a more collaborative notification system could look like in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3943.709s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I understand that there's a lot I don't know about the pressure that you're under.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3948.172s">[Kit Collins]</a>: However, I do think that there's more to this story about which city officials should know if one gets a notification that ICE is coming to town.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3955.738s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think that the only way this could look is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3958.361s">[Kit Collins]</a>: social media and then a mass panic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3959.823s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that there is a vested local public safety interest in having some heads up about, you know, obviously sometimes other jurisdictions come in and the goal is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3971.349s">[Kit Collins]</a>: there's a warrant for a dangerous person and it's in the interest of public safety, that is dealt with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3977.912s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've also seen raids in neighboring communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3981.453s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've seen ICE show up at schools and things that I think are counter to all of our values and goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3988.697s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I just, for me, I think that, I don't think this is the meeting to figure it out, but I do just want to put it on the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3994.079s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that we have to have more of a conversation about this notification system and what that could look like, because I certainly don't think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4001.102s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think that's something that any of us want, is you say, heads up, I got a heads up, and that's all that I got.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4009.146s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then I don't think it's, personally, I don't think any colleague of mine would say, let me create a conflagration that's only going to upset people and not be helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4020.49s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And to me, it doesn't follow that would, the action of another leader would,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4028.7s">[Kit Collins]</a>: justify accusing you with impinging on an investigation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4032.022s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that there's a valid reason to talk more about this and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4062.056s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sure, I guess to me, it's like, what's the difference?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4071.56s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The officer's safety is impacted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4073.781s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4074.041s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If they know if ISIS is here or if they don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4168.862s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Certainly, and I think we all are very focused on that and thinking very, very deeply about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4176.775s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just think for me, given that when it sounds like when ice is notifying MPD that they're going to be in Medford that they're giving such vague information anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4187.387s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Based on that that's my interpretation of what you said and you can correct me if I'm wrong they're not giving you details you don't know details you just know we're coming to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4196.772s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It just seems to me that there might be a little bit of room for negotiation on what can other leaders know again with, I don't think anybody is trying to create panic or create a mob situation I think I mean for me personally as one Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4209.819s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we're all aware of how unhelpful and dangerous that kind of consequences that's not the goal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4252.079s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4252.799s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a really complicated situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4254.261s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that we're all trying very hard to mitigate harm and reduce harm and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4261.7s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yep, establish some control in a, you know, certainly a bear was poked, not by us, you know, these politics are bigger than us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4269.686s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, that's my conviction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4270.827s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And now we're all trying to deal with the fallout and I think that there are things to discuss in terms of what can we do within our jurisdiction, not to be flashy not to get on national news but just to make sure that people are safer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4478.929s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4479.289s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I just wanted to follow up on Marie's point about timing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4482.392s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Per the ordinance passed in 2023, this report was due March 15, and the council's annual public reporting was due April 15, which we didn't complete because this piece was not submitted until after that deadline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4497.265s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I was just going to say to give constituents more time to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4501.789s">[Kit Collins]</a>: review the reports and the Medford Parking Department's report, if they so choose, and have those comments be reflected in our annual public reporting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4511.375s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Because we are already past due, I would propose I was going to make a motion to myself craft the annual public report like I did last year, because I'm very familiar with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4523.68s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would, just to inform my councillors, I think it'd be fine to have that be due for the City Council meeting on the 27th instead of the most immediate one, which is on May 13th, just to give constituents a little extra time to review the reporting and put any comments on the record before it is filed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4562.141s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4564.127s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I could make it as a motion after a public comment, but I was just going to say I was going to offer to put together the council's annual public report and I could do that for the May 27th meeting instead of the May 13th meeting just to give residents a little extra time to digest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4990.236s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4991.636s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Appreciate the additional<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4994.618s">[Kit Collins]</a>: comment and attention to detail from constituents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=4997.499s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was just wondering, I know there were a lot of specific questions just raised, if there's anything that she or your team could speak to in this meeting, specifically the cost for redaction from the public, is that something that you can provide a little clarity on or some of the other questions that Jean raised?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=5407.335s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=5417.168s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think digesting some of the public comment, I think one of the themes brought up by the public on this topic is, you know, the value of reporting in getting the data to back up what we know about the good faith intent of these equipment, this equipment and people using them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=5437.401s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I heard Jean say earlier, it would be helpful to know how many instances of record after the fact, prohibited recordings, improper use of body-worn camera videos.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=5448.309s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If the audits or just the day-in, day-out supervision that goes on in the office, if those are observed, I think it'd be helpful for us to have a record of for the next annual surveillance report, even if the number for each of those<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=5467.422s">[Kit Collins]</a>: record after the fact, prohibit recordings, improper use of body-worn camera videos, even if the number for every single one of those is zero, I still think it would be helpful to have that added as a line item on the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=5478.877s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, obviously, we have the twin goals of these improving public safety in Medford and following through on the goal of them, improving accountability trust transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=5489.127s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that one of the best things we can do with this structure of the seacops ordinance in general and with the reporting is if there's really good stuff to report let's report it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=5497.795s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If there's no impropriety that's ever been absorbed in the office, you know, with this equipment and their usage, that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=5505.182s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Like, let's report it, let's include it on the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=5507.564s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I just wanted to flag that for next year's reporting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=5512.068s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that would be useful to track and to add.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=5515.271s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=5517.493s">[Kit Collins]</a>: With that, since my microphone is already on, I would formally make my motion to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=5522.577s">[Kit Collins]</a>: have myself as sponsor create the annual City Council's annual public report on all of the surveillance documentation that we've received this year about 2024, and that includes Medford Parking Department as well as Medford Police Department for inclusion on the May 27th City Council agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=5549.105s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just for folks who are newer to this process,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=5551.646s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that is just the City Council's compilation of all of the use policies, impact reports, and annual surveillance reports that we have received from city departments and agencies that do have an authorized use of surveillance technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=5581.407s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the motion is just for me to make the annual public report and put it on for May 27.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Z2FJ-QAM28&t=729.453s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, it's not a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Z2FJ-QAM28&t=730.253s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanted to say thank you for kicking off the departmental budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Z2FJ-QAM28&t=734.033s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh my gosh, two and a half hours of zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Z2FJ-QAM28&t=737.234s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for kicking off our budget hearings and thank you for presenting your budget to us tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Z2FJ-QAM28&t=742.035s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Z2FJ-QAM28&t=742.715s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thanks for your time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Z2FJ-QAM28&t=743.335s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Z2FJ-QAM28&t=2119.276s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Z2FJ-QAM28&t=2119.596s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't have a question, just a comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Z2FJ-QAM28&t=2122.298s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Z2FJ-QAM28&t=2125.598s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For me, I started my term when we were still contracting out parking services to a private vendor, so I just want to thank you for taking over the helm of the still quite new department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Z2FJ-QAM28&t=2135.0s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is very exciting to see it be brought further in-house and see it solidify there and see what the staff and you as our department head are continuing to do to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Z2FJ-QAM28&t=2148.464s">[Kit Collins]</a>: help it be embedded into our city services here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Z2FJ-QAM28&t=2151.666s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's exciting stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Z2FJ-QAM28&t=2152.346s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know it's a lot to manage, probably one of our more complicated city departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Z2FJ-QAM28&t=2158.229s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I just want to thank you for your work and for your transparency with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Z2FJ-QAM28&t=2950.324s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Z2FJ-QAM28&t=2950.644s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanted to add my voice to the chorus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Z2FJ-QAM28&t=2952.405s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for being here and also for all of the enthusiasm and dedication that you bring to this role every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Z2FJ-QAM28&t=2960.551s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It really is evident in everything that you say about your job and the many, many programs that you've spearheaded in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Z2FJ-QAM28&t=2969.056s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're very lucky to have you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Z2FJ-QAM28&t=2969.977s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Our community is very lucky to have you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Z2FJ-QAM28&t=2972.258s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And this has been said before, but I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Z2FJ-QAM28&t=2978.068s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We all appreciate how you go above and beyond to make sure that you're leveraging all of the resources at your disposal and staying very laser-focused on outcomes for veterans, which is, of course, why you're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Z2FJ-QAM28&t=2987.133s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're very lucky that you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Z2FJ-QAM28&t=2988.334s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=959.293s">[Kit Collins]</a>: due to some key players being stuck in traffic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=965.716s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So apologies for the wait.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=967.737s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We will be getting going as soon as we can, hopefully in just 10 minutes or so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=972.14s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for your patience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=1401.439s">[Kit Collins]</a>: stuff that only Anna's can speak to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=1429.173s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There will be a meeting of the Medford City Council Planning and Permitting Committee, April 30, 2025.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=1436.557s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This meeting will take place at 6.15 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=1439.779s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in the City Council Chamber, second floor, Medford City Hall, 85 George V. Hassett Drive, Medford MA, and via Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=1446.843s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=1453.407s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=1461.181s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=1462.002s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Five present, zero absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=1464.085s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The meeting is called to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=1466.267s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for bearing with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=1468.21s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Everybody, there was bad traffic on 93, hence the slightly late start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=1472.935s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you very much all for your patience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=1476.96s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The action discussion item for this committee meeting is, as it almost always is, Paper 24-033, Zoning Ordinance Updates with the Innes Associates team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=1486.833s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is the 24th Zoning Updates project meeting with Innes Associates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=1492.7s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Tonight, we will be discussing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=1495.664s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Upcoming meetings and public Q and A's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=1497.726s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have a few new ones to announce and promote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=1502.632s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Updates to the draft Medford Square zoning proposal, updates to the draft West Medford Square zoning proposal, a review of other upcoming zoning topics and updates from now through the end of the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=1518.812s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and other updates as NS associates and city staff and councillors see fit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=1524.494s">[Kit Collins]</a>: With that, Paola, unless you need more time to get settled, I'll pass it to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2421.613s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes, thank you, Paula, for that overview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2423.274s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do think we should probably go through Medford Square in totality before we move on to West Medford Square, just to keep things organized, if that's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2431.919s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2432.84s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So before we move on, if you wouldn't mind, let's go back to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2438.484s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I suspect I'm not the only Councilor who wants to spend at least a moment comparing Medford Square Proposal 1 and Proposal 2, just so that we're all clear on the changes to the map that were made since we talked about this three weeks ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2454.509s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So for folks who weren't at our meeting, three weeks ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2457.372s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Welcome and if you were, thank you for being there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2459.995s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Or maybe it was four weeks ago at this point I'm mixing up my squares I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2463.879s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We had a robust detailed discussion about the draft zoning map at that time was the first time we had seen a map proposal put forward for Medford square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2474.429s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And there were several suggestions from members of the community and from Councilors about specific sections of the map that we were curious about or wanted to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2483.876s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If there was another an alternate sub district assignment that might make more sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2488.679s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It was a wide ranging conversation if you want all that context I encourage folks to watch the meeting back it's linked on the zoning website on the city on the city page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2500.227s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I just wanted to take another beat with this before we moved on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2503.429s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Paola, for the, on the Proposal 2 image you mentioned, and there was a new section study done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2511.455s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for the area to the east of Clippership Drive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2515.818s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That was one of the things we spent a good amount of time on a month ago asking, is this an area that could be appropriate for even<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2522.603s">[Kit Collins]</a>: more height and somebody made the suggestion, not me, though I'm very sympathetic to it, that it's in a way that you can argue it's advantageous to have your maximum heights right next to a highway because there aren't abutters on the highway, there are only commuters and it also provides a visual and sound barrier from the surrounding business districts and residential districts to the highway, which can be nice because the highway is quite noisy, air pollution and whatnot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2550.82s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this map reflects a switch to MX3 on those parcels to the east of Clippership Drive, whereas it used to be a mix of MX2 and MX3.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2568.105s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll go to Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2570.066s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know this was an issue of note for you at our previous meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2810.285s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2810.565s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Anything more at this time, Councilor Lemon?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2814.147s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2814.967s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2819.85s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Check Zoom for hands from my fellow Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2822.831s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing none.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2826.018s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, I have a few comments to make before I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2828.379s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There were a couple things I forgot to mention at the beginning of the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2832.142s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One of them is for folks who are not familiar with our committee meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2835.123s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We do take public participation for each section at the end of the section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2840.006s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So for anybody who has a question or a comment, we will absolutely get to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2842.627s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll just go through discussion with councilors and city staff first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2846.61s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And also for folks who are not on the Zoom, we put this in the chat, but if you're<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2853.213s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that we're looking at on zoom this evening and finding it hard to look at all of these materials that will be looking at tonight are listed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2862.739s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On the city council's public portal, so you can find that from the city website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2868.083s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And if you go to tonight's meeting, you'll be able to view them in higher resolution at home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2874.227s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2874.567s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I forgot to mention that earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2877.028s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So moving back to the proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2880.923s">[Kit Collins]</a>: really appreciate the adjustments that have been made since last time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2884.425s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This addresses a lot of my requests and questions, speaking as one Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2892.85s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Before we move on, I was just hoping if we could quickly get a walk through any other changes to the map that were made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2900.077s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm not seeing a ton, I just kind of want that confirmed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2903.04s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know one other, I had the same request as Councilor Leming regarding the parcels that are now MX3 east of Clippership Drive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2911.467s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, I also last time had a question about the parcels south of High Street that are currently assigned MX one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2919.233s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just curious if MX to a would help create.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2923.055s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was my concern was about the transition from MX one to MX to a, um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2928.8s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And relatedly also had some requests and questions about if it would be appropriate to kind of upshift a lot of MX2 and MX3 from MX2a to MX2b, from MX2b to MX3.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2942.379s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Based on my non-zoning expert look at these maps this evening, I'm not seeing a lot of changes to the colors on the map except for the now all-magenta part to the east.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2954.787s">[Kit Collins]</a>: However, what the colors mean has been tweaked a little bit, as you said earlier, Paula.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2961.932s">[Kit Collins]</a>: which I think gets at least some of what the discussion centered around last time saying, you know, the places where it's really appropriate to have more height so that we can enjoy things like more housing units close to this nexus of the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2977.429s">[Kit Collins]</a>: more people to patronize businesses, more businesses, more ability to hide parking underneath development so that there's still parking but it's not taking up active street space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2986.235s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm really happy to see those increases in by right height.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2990.898s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I was just hoping if you could speak to that rationale just quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2993.8s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think you did mention that it's only the by right heights that have changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2997.262s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's no change to the number of incentive zoning floors that could be added.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3001.786s">[Kit Collins]</a>: if developers achieve that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3005.213s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I'm happy to see this upshifting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3006.916s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it makes sense to do it in this way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3008.319s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But if you wouldn't mind just kind of providing a summary of those changes before we go on, I think that'd be helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3182.003s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for that explanation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3182.963s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3183.844s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'll be curious to hear if any of my fellow councillors have an opinion on if that would be valuable or if it seems right as is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3194.388s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go to Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3436.692s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you for that explanation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3437.973s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's interesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3441.336s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it's good to know that these are getting re-evaluated and re-tailored as we go along and get more information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3448.882s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that sounds well-tailored.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3452.385s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3459.117s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One quick question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3459.797s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It sounds like the development, well, it seems very clear to me that the development standards are an in progress thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3466.338s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll be hearing more about that in future meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3468.919s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Would those, the development standards that you brought forward tonight, do you anticipate those being specific to Medford Square?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3478.501s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I assume that's going to be kind of a mix of citywide standards and standards that are tailored to different geographies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3556.635s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any further questions, comments, concerns from Councilors at this time on the Medford Square zoning proposal?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3564.48s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just to recap, later in the meeting, very soon in the meeting, we will be going over West Medford Square as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3570.024s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then again, promoting the upcoming zoning meetings and Q&As after this one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3575.991s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Check on seeing no hands in the chambers, I'll check on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3579.914s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing no hands from Councilors, we're gonna go to public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3586.199s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For this item, you may speak up at the podium or on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3592.443s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Please feel free to line up behind the microphone if you are in person or just raise your hand on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3597.607s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Every participant will be asked to give their name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3600.69s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I will set a timer for three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3603.677s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, seeing nobody at the podium, I will go to Zoom first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3609.281s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Cheryl, name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3611.443s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3668.452s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3678.314s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for your comment, Cheryl.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3681.575s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Do we have any Director Spicey?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3685.376s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3686.836s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Good idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3687.416s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll finish public comment and then we'll respond and then move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3707.961s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3708.241s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll go to Emily and then we'll go back to public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3758.224s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Emily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3758.984s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it occurs to me that it's not intuitive when you just look at the map as it is when you're reading the zoning code tip to tail, which I encourage people to do if they have the attention span and patience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3773.072s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But the way that the zoning is written into the zoning ordinance is by district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3779.536s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I can understand how the misunderstanding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3783.978s">[Kit Collins]</a>: would occur, and it's like mixed use two is here, mixed use two here, surely they are the same, but they're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3790.241s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These standards and rules and what these terms mean is defined by district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3795.864s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for that clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3797.165s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I will go to President Bears and then we'll go back to public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3850.731s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3851.071s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's a good point back to you, Emily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3882.019s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Emily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3888.453s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, we'll go back to Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3891.694s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Daniel, name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3894.236s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You will have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=4036.9s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for your comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=4042.504s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go next to Alex.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=4044.626s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=4046.387s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=4154.904s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=4155.164s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for your comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=4159.872s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The topic of parking within the square has definitely been enthusiastically discussed during this process and I think the I think everybody's on board that we it's not tenable to see parking disappear from the square we want people to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=4174.541s">[Kit Collins]</a>: be able to drive in and patronize our businesses and everything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=4179.208s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Some people need to drive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=4180.189s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's perfectly fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=4182.272s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've discussed a mix of strategies, including kind of on the private side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=4187.379s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think the city is looking at parking lot development<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=4192.446s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And within the scope of zoning, we've had a lot of discussions about how this zoning would allow us to retain public parking, but on the footprint of lots so rather than taking up ground space that could be activated how it could be folded into the envelope of buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=4207.799s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I will pass the mic to President Bears will probably have more to say about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=4215.586s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=4396.627s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=4397.847s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you to all commenters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=4399.608s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you President Bears for fielding that comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=4407.211s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know we've got to move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=4407.931s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know we're short on time, but I did want to pick up on, is there a short refresher on why those residential parcels in the square are NR3 and not UR1?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=4543.94s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=4545.241s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, Paula, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=4584.003s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=4584.963s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=4588.444s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=4588.924s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any more comments on Medford Square from Councilors before we move on to, uh, our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=4596.987s">[Kit Collins]</a>: quick and efficient discussion of West Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=4598.889s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I apologize to people who are here for the 7 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=4601.692s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My apologies, we got started late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=4605.496s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing none, on we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=4607.357s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I apologize for the pace tonight, everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=4622.685s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll go to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=4662.729s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, we'll go through the whole agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=4664.89s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was just, I didn't want to, I was feeling bad for maybe stressing people out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=4667.551s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I rescind my apology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=4669.292s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You rescind your apology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=4670.793s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Nobody apologizes for everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=4672.874s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Zoning is complicated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=4673.774s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll take the time that we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=4674.775s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And thank you, department heads for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=4678.977s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=4679.477s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well, apologies having been rescinded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=4682.198s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let's go back to the presentation for West Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=4684.98s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5037.765s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you so much for this overview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5039.966s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is exciting to see our first meeting looking closely at the West Medford Square zoning map.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5048.888s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that was the one that was three weeks ago, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5052.028s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's been a long month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5052.749s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It was an exciting meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5055.409s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We had so much community feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5057.79s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As one resident, as one Councilor, I'm really excited by the vision for West Medford Square that we see in this map.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5066.312s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that this will<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5068.553s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5068.713s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Incentivize enable and encourage a lot of the vibrancy and activity and business development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5075.017s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5075.998s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That people already celebrate in West Medford Square and want to see more of and enable the, uh, housing units that will make that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5090.548s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As you went over, just the couple color changes, as I'll call them, the St.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5095.952s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Raphael's owned lots have been combined into the same zoning subdistrict, which makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5101.576s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I do see it's like a really small triangle between the rail and Canal Street that's been flipped from MX2A to MX2B.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5109.562s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5112.044s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so, again, a lot of our conversation at the first committee meeting centered around, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5120.668s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The way that I put it, and other people put it differently, was what should the default zoning be for this square?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5126.132s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My opinion was it should be MX2B.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5128.573s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's the site that makes sense to apply to most of the land area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5135.638s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So here we see those kind of minor additions of MX2B, but I see that the changes to by right heights have been adjusted for West Medford Square, as they have been for Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5145.745s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just to reiterate, that's not a change, like we just talked about, it's not a change to what those mean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5150.168s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Citywide, it's a change to what they mean in the squares.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5153.472s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So in Mixed Use 2A, it's now five stories by right with two incentive above if incentive zoning applies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5160.881s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In Mixed Use 2B, it's seven stories by right plus two incentive zoning stories above if developers seek and achieve incentive zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5170.871s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5172.532s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that having the residential only zoning in the square be your urban residential too makes a lot of sense because of the specific area and its amenities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5184.834s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that's just my note of enthusiasm to start off the discussion with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5188.594s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are there any initial comments and questions from Councilors on this proposal?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5196.256s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5405.571s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5406.051s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's a really important<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5409.558s">[Kit Collins]</a>: thing to emphasize, probably every time we have this conversation, we talk about, it's one thing to talk about the potential, and another to talk about what that, how that potential is bounded by reality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5428.714s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Obviously, that's zoning, but I appreciate that we can talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5431.657s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's important to have the discussion about what we want that maximum potential to be in the specific neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5438.502s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and then make some more tailored predictions based on the actual on-the-ground context.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5447.834s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5448.214s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just to reiterate what Paola said in the presentation, there was a lot of commentary at our first committee meeting about the High Street corridor leading down to Arlington and the activation of the Boston Avenue corridor on the West Medford Square side of the river.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5465.768s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I heard that those will be topics that we'll dive deeper into at our next committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5470.091s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll be talking about other corridors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5473.274s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So stay tuned to everybody who advocated passionately for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5478.0s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are there any other comments or questions from councillors on this proposal or from city staff?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5488.467s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, seeing none, we will go to public participation for this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5497.192s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As I said before,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5499.586s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Everybody will say their name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5502.327s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Everybody will have three minutes, I will set a timer, and we will go to the podium first once the microphone makes its way back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5509.872s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, one second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5519.437s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, go ahead, name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5587.032s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5587.272s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll go to President Paris.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5670.048s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you for raising that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5671.33s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for the explanation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5674.296s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, we'll go back to Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5678.303s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Zoe, name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5680.307s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You will have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5723.314s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, we're getting a yes from people who have every stream approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5728.717s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5758.104s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes, that's correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5869.854s">[Kit Collins]</a>: definitely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5872.155s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5873.115s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5874.335s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5874.655s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Appreciate your comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5875.475s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for flagging that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5876.436s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And yes, preserving and incentivizing greater access to the commuter rail has been something we've been servicing throughout the discussion of West Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5886.978s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it will probably be a West Medford Square specific incentive zoning stipulation as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5894.12s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, we'll proceed with other participants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5897.921s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll go to Michael.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5899.842s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5901.082s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You'll have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5909.424s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Hang on, Michael.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5910.005s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We can't hear you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=5914.626s">[Kit Collins]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6064.305s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you for your comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6066.267s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Philosophical questions are certainly always welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6077.464s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Plenty to respond to there I'll just say I think your perspective is welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6080.748s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that there are a lot of ways that we've been discussing on how to preserve and achieve that attractive compelling pleasant neighborhood feel and certainly different successful village centers do that differently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6095.827s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also think that we're pretty constrained here by the existing character of smaller residential type buildings surrounding the square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6103.93s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think it is incumbent upon us to work within those constraints to a certain extent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6113.965s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for your comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6115.205s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, we will go to Cheryl, unless there's anybody who has not, oh, we'll go first to people who haven't spoken at all yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6125.728s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please, and then we'll go back to Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6188.145s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll pause you then we can get back to the rest of your comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6190.186s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's, I will say, I think this is, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6193.51s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think what you're speaking to their strategies that we can address through zoning, a lot of dealing with existing small businesses outside of zoning, but I'll go to a quick response to Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6335.098s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6335.878s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6338.14s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6338.68s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Please do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6344.324s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I frequently say zoning<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6347.782s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Through zoning, we're taking the kind of long-term vision for the community, what we'd like to see happen over the next five to 35 years, and writing that blueprint in our zoning map.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6356.929s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Some of those changes might happen faster than we think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6360.451s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Some of them we wish would happen much faster.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6362.773s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think a lot of the goals of our current zoning, we're still waiting to see them manifest, hence a lack of the vibrancy we'd like to see in the current Medford Square and the current West Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6373.461s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So all that to say, it's tough to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6377.285s">[Kit Collins]</a>: when we will, when we will envisage that utopic West Medford Square that I think we can all see very clearly on our mind's eye, but these zoning changes, I think, in conjunction with more direct measures help us to incentivize more businesses coming in populating the squares.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6451.923s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes, so no more 14-story hotels, but yes to nine-story Seabee Scoops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6458.164s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go ahead, Bella.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6509.373s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6509.853s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6510.673s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we'll recap the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6526.249s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll share the meeting info at the end of the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6534.794s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thanks, Paula.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6536.015s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, let's get to our last two public commentators on deck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6542.991s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Cheryl, name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6544.532s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6606.107s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for your comment, Cheryl.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6607.108s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I will say, I think that some of the differences, actually, I know that many of the differences in allowed uses between the squares and Mystic Avenue Corridor District and Salem Street Corridor District are intentional and have been the product of discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6625.079s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we will continue to consider how it would make sense to differentiate the sub-district types so that they<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6632.303s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So it's more intuitive that we're not talking about all MX2A when we're talking about MX2A, for example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6637.948s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6639.049s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, we will go to Marcella.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6644.534s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6646.416s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6769.592s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you so much for your comments for participating in this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6778.204s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Going next to Daniel name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6781.989s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6969.499s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6972.942s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for your comments, Daniel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6974.524s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6978.793s">[Kit Collins]</a>: similar question from me as there was before to NS Associates if possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6986.779s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I believe we've talked in a previous committee meeting about the southwest side of the train tracks and they're currently characterized under the neighborhood and urban residential proposal as NR3 to the previous commenter's question about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=7003.911s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the considerations around aligning these with UR1 or MX1 as part of that step down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=7014.272s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to phrase it the way I did before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=7015.553s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is there a short version of what we've discussed for that strip along the railway in terms of lot size leading to its designation as NR3?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=7025.061s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know that earlier you said we're anticipating a tool that we'll look at next week that helps us look with more granularity at why certain lots are certain sub-districts and not others, but to the point about grading it into the square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=7245.854s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for those responses, Paola, I really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=7254.133s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, too many windows open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=7255.213s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I lost my train of thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=7256.554s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Makes a lot of sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=7257.414s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And, um, as has been spoken about the neighborhood and urban residential proposal, which is all of the kind of washed out areas on this map that are outside the boundaries of the squares themselves fall under the neighborhood and urban residential zoning proposal, which is very much still in process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=7272.941s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll be back at the CBP next Wednesday, May 7th, and I know that you're looking over the version of the map that the city council<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=7283.004s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and you've been working on an adjusted version as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=7285.925s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's responding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=7286.625s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's respondent to public comment that's been received since that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=7290.906s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know there has been a lot of talk specifically around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=7294.567s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What is the default sub district that should go in the quarter mile radius outside of the T station?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=7299.148s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'd be interested to see if it's not already, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=7302.829s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Proposal for an amendment to make that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=7309.522s">[Kit Collins]</a>: appropriate to consider and help with that transition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=7312.383s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for speaking to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=7314.144s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll go to President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=7326.89s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=7328.69s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=7330.151s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, going back to Alex on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=7332.892s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=7333.813s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=7397.125s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you for the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=7398.447s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Alex, this is something we've been talking about throughout this process on each of the major proposals that we've come across before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=7412.691s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Ennis has been doing great work in considering intersectional studies and a host of context criteria when putting these zoning proposals together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=7423.555s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When it comes to specific traffic studies, I think we use that term, that is something, the most appropriate use of a traffic study is kind of where they currently sit in site plan review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=7434.958s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A traffic study done now as we craft new zoning that will be implemented<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=7441.441s">[Kit Collins]</a>: kind of based on the will of private developers over the next several decades would quickly become dated and unuseful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=7451.346s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So while that is a factor and how these zoning proposals come together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=7455.808s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What's great about our public process for when major developments do come in is there's a baked-in process for those kind of context and mitigation studies and mitigation mechanisms that are respondent not to the conditions right now in the year 2025, but these specific conditions when a development is actually getting proposed and is about to be constructed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=7477.265s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, so all that to say the context is absolutely an ingredient in these and the more specific mitigation studies and plans come into effect when specific developments are proposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=7489.091s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Anybody else want to speak to this quickly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=7491.292s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=7493.673s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=7494.373s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for the comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=7497.895s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=7498.215s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I see no more public participation on this item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=7505.649s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think, do we have one more short section in the presentation for tonight, Paola?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=7527.086s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=8119.929s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=8120.369s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for that overview, Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=8122.231s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And this is a topic that we have discussed in depth in committee, I think twice before now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=8130.877s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you for all of the adjustments that you've made so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=8134.64s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know we've<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=8136.862s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's been great to get very solid on what is mandated by the new state law, which requires that ADUs be permissible by right in any zoning sub-district that allows single-family zoning by right, and then to spend the time that was needed on those questions of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=8152.618s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Those are protected ADUs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=8153.598s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For the local ADUs where the city has more discretion, how do we want to answer those questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=8158.661s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Based on my notes from the committee's past couple of conversations, it sounded to me like there was general consensus that we were okay with a second ADU being allowed as long as it was always by special permit, which is what I heard in your presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=8172.968s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It sounded like there were good reasons for keeping the special permit local ADU at a maximum of 900 square feet, just to affirm that these are intended to be accessory dwellings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=8187.279s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm always trying to find the synonym for inferior, not inferior to, but smaller than.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=8191.882s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Diminutive to, the main structure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=8195.564s">[Kit Collins]</a>: After two hours, my vocabulary starts to...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=8200.761s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Correct me if I'm wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=8201.442s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think the only two questions that are new to this discussion are, should bigger detached ADUs be allowed for historic accessory structures?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=8209.808s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then those dimensions, which will be tailored after the residential districts are proposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=8216.354s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It sounded to me like the recommendation was that larger detached ADUs sometimes make sense for historic accessory structures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=8227.336s">[Kit Collins]</a>: because you want the accessory use to fit the building envelope and the intent is to use an existing smaller structure that's not big enough to be a principal dwelling, but can work as an accessory structure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=8237.339s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Am I paraphrasing that roughly correctly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=8241.18s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing not, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=8245.141s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are there any questions, comments from councilors on the proposed updates to the ADU regulations?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=8260.73s">[Kit Collins]</a>: seeing none.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=8261.23s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's a testament to the lots of discussion that we've had on this in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=8265.714s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I also, I know that the NS Associates gave not a presentation of the proposal per se, but kind of an overview and introduction to the topic of ADUs to the CDB at their last meeting, which I'm sure will be very helpful groundwork for when they consider this proposal after it is reported out of committee, hopefully tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=8289.91s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And some of the graphics that were included in this presentation, I understand, were created for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=8294.233s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think they're really additive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=8296.114s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So seeing no comments from councilors, we will go to public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=8301.156s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll go to the podium and then to Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=8307.178s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=8435.887s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If you don't mind, Gaston, why don't you just say your questions now, and then we'll just pass the microphone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=8500.847s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Gaston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=8515.319s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=8751.607s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9094.942s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9095.342s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm going to go to Daniel Murdoch on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9100.345s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address of the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9101.325s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9178.158s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9179.059s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for your comments, Daniel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9186.75s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, is there any final public participation on this item?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9191.889s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Gaston?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9384.077s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9385.418s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9386.178s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for the explanation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9391.963s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you to all members of the public for the thoughtful questions and commentary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9400.512s">[Kit Collins]</a>: To Emily and Paola, does that give you a clear answer on the additional questions pertaining to local ADUs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9406.874s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9407.354s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that we have, after several weeks, checked every box when it pertains to what decisions to make on the local ADU decisions within our purview then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9418.978s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9420.099s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you to everybody for all the discussion that's gone into that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9423.92s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I see no more public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9425.56s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll go to Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9459.636s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go ahead, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9468.265s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9470.707s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes, looking forward to emphasizing these again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9473.63s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you to Paola for at the beginning of the meeting, running through our upcoming meetings and public Q&As.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9479.136s">[Kit Collins]</a>: timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9479.776s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to again emphasize those before we take the vote and move to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9486.259s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh thank you, I see you're pulling up the slide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9489.48s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We will get this updated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9490.661s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this is already updated on the zoning website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9493.282s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll make sure that's totally up to date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9495.423s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we have added a number of public Q&As to our zoning meetings timeline in addition to our regularly scheduled<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9504.748s">[Kit Collins]</a>: planning and permitting committee meetings and CDB public hearings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9508.458s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So tomorrow,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9511.576s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have a public Q&A.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9513.216s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is not germane to this topic that we discussed tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9515.918s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It will be a focus group meeting on Zoom for Tufts institutional zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9524.382s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On Zoom only, Thursday, my first, 7 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9527.603s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The goal of this meeting is to hear from area residents on what they would like to see for zoning changes to the Tufts University campus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9533.646s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is prior to us drafting or workshopping a proposal for this area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9538.648s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The intent is to hear questions, concerns, suggestions, preferences from the residents in that area before we start crafting a proposal and before we go and begin negotiating an institutional zone with the university.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9555.132s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this is geared towards Tufts University neighbors, but it is, of course, open to everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9559.673s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And again, that's tomorrow at 7 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9562.174s">[Kit Collins]</a>: on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9562.714s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All details are on the city website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9568.405s">[Kit Collins]</a>: excuse me, proceeding chronologically on May 7th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9573.707s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The neighborhood and urban residential proposal will be back at the Community Development Board for a public hearing that was referenced tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9582.211s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I encourage everybody to join.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9585.413s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The CDB public hearings always include public comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9588.514s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's a great opportunity to learn about the proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9590.955s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and to put your opinions on the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9593.396s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The following evening, May 8, we'll be having a public Q&A on what we discussed tonight, Medford Square zoning proposal, West Medford Square zoning proposal, and the proposed updates to the ADUs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9607.103s">[Kit Collins]</a>: regulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9608.204s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We will be having that at 6.30 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9611.366s">[Kit Collins]</a>: at the Andrews Cafetorium, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9614.327s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9616.648s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Everybody's welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9618.209s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Ask questions, hear comments, hear an overview of these proposals again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9623.072s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just to restate in case anybody is new to this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9626.613s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Now that this well, assuming that the vote goes favorably now that this proposal will be reported out of committee, it will be referred to the city council where it will be immediately referred to the Community Development Board, all zoning amendments updates or new zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9643.238s">[Kit Collins]</a>: After being workshopped in committee, procedurally have to be referred to the CBB for a public hearing before they may be referred back to the City Council, where we will take the final vote to ordain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9654.246s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this is kind of the end of the beginning for a zoning proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9658.529s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's a lot of opportunities for public comment and learning still to come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9661.892s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we hope that anybody who's interested will participate in as many of them as they like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9666.415s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So all of these upcoming meetings can be found at medfordma.org slash zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9675.487s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Did I miss any important dates?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9677.088s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9679.45s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9681.171s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go ahead, President Burrs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9697.627s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Maybe we should make all the text smaller.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9723.577s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I will work with Ennis to get that updated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9725.037s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for the suggestion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9726.658s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, so on the motion by Councilor Leming to report the Medford Square zoning proposal, West Medford Square zoning proposal and proposed updates to the ADU ordinance to a regular meeting of the City Council for referral to Community Development Board, seconded by President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9746.262s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, please, and adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9749.202s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When you're ready, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9764.433s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9770.358s">[Kit Collins]</a>: She may have had to depart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9780.447s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9784.503s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, did you get president bears?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9787.884s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9789.945s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Uh, four in favor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9792.106s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No, none opposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9793.146s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9793.686s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Uh, the meeting passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9795.407s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The proposals are referred and the meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9798.968s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9800.349s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Uh, thank you so much to everybody for sticking with us through a long meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=9802.89s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, thank you as always to our city staff and associates for their support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=612.478s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=614.779s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Director Marie Cassidy is a woman in Medford who truly needs no introduction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=620.343s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I heard earlier this month that she was announcing her retirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=624.985s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Never thought I'd see the day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=626.146s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is hard to think of a person more dedicated and enthusiastic about a role in public service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=633.991s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think many people in Medford, myself included, find her genuinely inspirational.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=638.493s">[Kit Collins]</a>: person so just wanted to make sure this city council had a moment to publicly extend our gratitude to her for her years and years of tireless service on behalf of Medford families and children, and to wish her a very long and happy retirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=653.745s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=1145.628s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I apologize I motioned a table to our next regular meeting as I did not review them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=1152.053s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=1153.074s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You were special meeting April 15th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=1226.161s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We referred out of committee the proposed ordinance change submitted by the parking department, and we reviewed the draft first annual surveillance reporting by the parking department, which they have resubmitted with a couple minor amendments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=1241.925s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so the council will review those again as part of the council paper on the topic next month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=1261.923s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=1262.303s">[Kit Collins]</a>: At the Planning and Permitting Committee on April 9th, this was our 20-something meeting with the zoning consultant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=1271.646s">[Kit Collins]</a>: At this meeting, we were going over in greater detail a draft of the zoning proposal for West Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=1280.548s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This wasn't the first time we'd seen this map, but it was the first time we'd spent a whole meeting concentrating on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=1287.37s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We had a really lively discussion between councilors, city staff, the zoning consultant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=1292.291s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There was a lot of public comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=1293.572s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It was a really great meeting and we took in lots of feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=1296.552s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this proposal will come back to the committee again before it is referred to the Community Development Board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=1304.034s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=1642.917s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears and thank you Laurel for being here again for folks who weren't at the committee of the whole on the CDBG block grant funding a couple weeks ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=1652.689s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That was on April 16, I heard from Laurel with an overview of the annual action plan the consolidated plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=1659.918s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the updated citizen participation plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=1661.978s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We also heard from all prospective funding applicants, which is something that we do every year and speaking as one Councilor, it's always a joy to hear from these direct service providers who are using this federal grant funding to do really good work in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=1676.821s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's never glamorous stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=1677.961s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's just the stuff that residents really need and very grateful to them for assisting our public sector in getting residents recreation and food and access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=1689.183s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and things like that that everybody should have access to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=1694.129s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So with that being said, eager to approve this, I would make the following motion to approve the city's five-year consolidated plan for HUD funding, annual action plan for CDBG program year 2025, and updated citizen participation plan<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=1709.566s">[Kit Collins]</a>: with the funding amounts outlined in the consolidated plan and the annual action plan being subject to final adjustment as set forth in the draft annual action plan once HUD has notified the city of its annual allocation of CDBG funding for program year 2025.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2088.771s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Paper 25-063, offered by President Bears, resolution to request mitigation of sound and light impacts of new West Medford commuter rail platform.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2099.939s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we request that Keolis and the MBTA reduce the light levels and sound levels at the newly installed platform at the West Medford commuter rail station, especially at non-peak travel times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2112.627s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2237.683s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2435.906s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2437.27s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Going to Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2528.468s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2530.53s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is there any further comment from Councilors on this paper?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2535.721s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing none, we'll go to public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2538.363s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You can raise your hand on Zoom or line up in the hallway by the microphone, and I will switch between the podium and on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2548.351s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Every participant should be prepared to say their name and address for the record, and then you'll have three minutes to express yourself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2553.094s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2554.395s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll go to the podium first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2557.308s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2558.93s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And you'll have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2656.495s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2657.63s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2658.13s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2854.868s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2856.512s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate your testimony for putting this on the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2858.537s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll go back to President Thares and then back to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2864.417s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2946.379s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for your comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2947.5s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, we got one more hand on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=2956.112s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Jen, name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3078.997s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you, Jennifer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3084.642s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll go back to President Bears and then Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3263.253s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3264.194s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go to Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3354.522s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Leming, Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3418.428s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Lazzaro and my fellow colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3421.77s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And thank you again to the constituents who<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3426.0s">[Kit Collins]</a>: have been spending I'm sure hours and hours of your time that you really shouldn't have to not only not sleeping at night, but also advocating to kill us in the MBTA to make this very simple fix it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3438.312s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Like very, very obvious that there's no reason to have such bright lights and such loud noise on when the train is not even.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3444.785s">[Kit Collins]</a>: running and I share your total frustration that it is so hard to get such a simple thing rectified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3449.988s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm sorry for what you're going through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3451.709s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for involving us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3452.75s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We will continue to advocate with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3456.592s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's nice when a seemingly simple problem comes our way, but it's frustrating when it's not as quick to fix as it should be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3465.638s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So please keep us informed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3467.579s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3469.24s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So go back to President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3486.227s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Was very refreshing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3488.107s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Also had the benefit of derailing me from the anti-keyless, anti-privatization rant that I was preparing in my head.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3493.809s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Nobody needs that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3494.89s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Not today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3495.43s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Some other time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3497.86s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On the motion of President Bears to approve and submit to Keolis and the MBTA and the city administration, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3512.377s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3513.078s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3514.18s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3515.681s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3516.663s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4309.47s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, and thank you for being here, Bob, and thank you, Brenda, on Zoom for being present to answer the council's questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4316.293s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that the introduction to why this paper is before us kind of speaks for itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4320.355s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It makes a lot of, it makes, to me, all the sense in the world that we're funding this project and we've been talking about it for many months, and I know that the team kind of preparing the project has been talking about it for a lot longer than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4332.5s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you again to PDS staff and Peter Cushing, and given that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4339.356s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sure that we'll talk a lot more about free cash this budget season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4342.263s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that this is an unambiguously good way to spend this pot of $5 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4346.554s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It will<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4351.09s">[Kit Collins]</a>: it will relieve a lot of pressure on our FY26 or FY27 budget and budgets going forward to not have that further increase our debt service payments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4360.913s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are, I think, fortunate to be able to spend free cash on this very worthy and necessary project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4366.515s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm glad that it will have beneficial effects on our future operating budgets as well, because we all know how we continue to be hard pressed to use those dollars elsewhere in our operating budgets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4376.938s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I would motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=5220.72s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears, and I appreciate the way that Councilor Callahan frames this discussion I think all of that is really well put I appreciate the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=5230.848s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think every time that we talk about free cash, it is really important and valuable to state what it is, because the term is so imperfect to what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=5241.316s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I appreciate the context that with all of these financial decisions, it is not just seven people and city staff making a decision, but rather making decisions against a backdrop of a lot of state, regional, and federal best practice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=5258.929s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Another thing that I don't want to get lost in the sauce now that this project has gotten to the point where we're talking about it in the terms of bottom lines and loan orders is for folks who are not at the committees of the whole that started that started in December or the meetings, since then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=5273.961s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The work that we're talking about funding is work that will allow our elementary, in the case of the current paper and and middle schools and the previous one to have functioning HVAC and roofs that do not leak so what we're talking about we're talking about $25 million, and it is a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=5292.353s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Absolutely, if that feels like an eye popping number that makes sense because that's a really really big number in the context especially of individual lives and small businesses and individual households in the context of a city as Councilor Gallagher pointed out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=5305.657s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is still a big number and we're allowed to react to it as a big number but that is also what things cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=5311.439s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that as we're talking about it as a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=5314.26s">[Kit Collins]</a>: large and intimidating number to be committing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=5316.381s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We should also be talking about like, wow, if there's $30 million worth of updates that our schools need, then like the only thing worse than seeing $30 million go out the door is to not spend that money, because that's stuff that students really need and teachers really need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=5332.89s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it's going to make our schools a much better learning environment, which is the whole point of communities having schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=5340.994s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think that this is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=5345.523s">[Kit Collins]</a>: a really good use, I think it's really good when we can use a relative fraction of our amount of free cash to open the door to a project that it would be completely insensible to fund entirely through free cash and that can open the door to a project that it then makes more sense to complete with borrowing and I'm really looking forward to developing a clearer picture<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=5368.274s">[Kit Collins]</a>: of the spending and appropriation plan for the rest of our free cash in collaboration with the city administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=5373.659s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that is critical context for our budget season this year, and we'll continue to work on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=5381.325s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think that I, for myself as one councilor constituent, I'm thinking of this as a very good example of how we can use free cash to our community's best advantage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=5392.194s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=6663.904s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=6664.925s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I really appreciate the overview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=6669.03s">[Kit Collins]</a>: from Superintendent Cushing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=6671.293s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=6672.214s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is, again, never to diminish the gravity of spending our precious shared resources, but I'm so glad that we have the opportunity to do that on hardware and software that will make our schools safer for our students and teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=6691.834s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it is great to hear that we were able to negotiate down the amount that we are paying out in these insurance claims.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=6698.859s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=6699.799s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I would motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=7121.632s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears, I have a motion to take from the table and approve 25-045 and approve for third reading 25-053.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=7137.541s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's right, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8226.888s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8228.009s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears and thank you to my colleagues for their words in response to this prompt so far and thank you so much for being here and speaking up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8236.934s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I, this has been said before but I don't think it should go unmentioned that in it<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8245.152s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's not irrational, you know, in these times, depending on who you are and how you present and have a reasonable degree of thoughtfulness about how out there you put yourself and your convictions and to put your testimony on the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8258.771s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So really, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8261.054s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think for an advocate, such as yourself or somebody in your position, it probably goes without saying, but it shouldn't, which is that when you stand up for yourself and your own identity, you're standing up for everybody, you're standing up for everybody within marginalized identities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8272.827s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you for doing that for the residents of Medford and for continuing to hold leaders to account for doing the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8278.533s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8284.481s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're in such a unfortunately interesting period right now where it seems to me that a lot of the conversation, the central point for a lot of conversations is like, what are you going to do about it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8298.185s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Which is the right question to be asking, because we all have to be doing as much as we possibly can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8302.486s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it's unfortunate that the thing that we have to be doing is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8310.568s">[Kit Collins]</a>: working to resist a government whose goals are actually to make Americans less safe and less healthy and less well, with worse futures and less safety and less happiness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8328.742s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's a shame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8330.443s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's a shonda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8332.344s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8336.563s">[Kit Collins]</a>: thrusting in, I'm not a historian, but it feels to me like kind of an unprecedented time when we are at these various levels of government trying to negotiate what we can enforce and what we can ask of each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8348.487s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And for myself, as a person with a microphone and a title, it feels very shameful and insufficient to say<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8359.618s">[Kit Collins]</a>: there is a limit that we can observe to official action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8364.941s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And in some ways, I think that goes without saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8366.942s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Like, I found out about the ICE presence, the reported ICE presence in South Medford earlier this week, where I live, through Reddit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8376.328s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Because they just come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8378.349s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Because they just come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8379.81s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And they don't want us to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8382.491s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They just come in, and they try to take people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8385.453s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And there's no, obviously,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8389.295s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Obviously, there's no collaboration with local or state or regional forms of government because that's not the goal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8394.097s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The goal is not to collaborate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8395.137s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The goal is to displace people and divide communities and to make us enemies to one another, which is a completely false and inhumane pretense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8407.221s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All that to say, I think that like we can all envision<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8413.398s">[Kit Collins]</a>: responses that would help, that would stack on top of all what we're trying to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8417.801s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For example, I think it would be really great if the Medford Police Department and other local police departments in communities all over the nation felt more loyalty to their residents than they do to an antagonistic federal government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8434.292s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it would be ideal if we didn't have to create this pseudo public service hotline<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8442.798s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For example, the Luce hotline and other ice watches would be ideal if we didn't have to create a grassroots pseudo public service mechanism.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8452.023s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And if people could instead call the police and say, hey, there are people kidnapping my neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8457.446s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think that people in Medford feel that they can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8460.548s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I have not received, I've not seen an indication that that is something that our public safety officials are willing to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8469.292s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that people should be able to call 911 and say, hey, ICE is here and we don't know that they have a warrant and please come protect us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8476.275s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that is what we should be asking our police to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8481.176s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What we'll continue to, and this council has to continue to call on the mayor's administration and the police department under her jurisdiction to do more and to have more loyalty to our residents and our neighbors than we do to a federal government, which we know is going to antagonize communities like ours, no matter what we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8501.468s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But in the meantime, I think it is also rational and needed for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8506.933s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, and this is the part where I feel a little bad because I want the whole answer to be stuff within our control, but I don't think that it is I don't think I don't think that's that that's realistic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8514.898s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's, that's where I get very heartened to see people in our community who do not have official roles nonetheless.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8523.243s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Taking creative measures to keep each other safe by joining those ice watches by.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8529.907s">[Kit Collins]</a>: taking part in getting trained on the Luce hotline and being a part of that mechanism for keeping each other safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8537.59s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I should be clear, like other Councilors have been, I think that the limits to how aggressive our local forces have been in being vocal and assertive and just doing, you know, leaving it all on the field, doing everything we could possibly think of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8555.517s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to combat ICE in our communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8557.519s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think it is in any way attributable to people not caring or being okay with what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8563.543s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm not going to speculate about convictions or motives, but these people are members of our community too, and I don't think that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8570.648s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's the intimidation machine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8573.689s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and a fear of making things worse because of retaliation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8579.071s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanna make that clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8580.631s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't wanna point the finger at anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8581.891s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that that's part of the goal of this is for us to be pointing our fingers at each other and that's not what we should be doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8587.833s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We need to be welcoming each other into extremely resilient local systems of public safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8593.335s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So to that, I think we need to continue to call upon<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8599.582s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the mayor's administration, including the NPD and all of our public safety infrastructure to say, let's stand up taller together and if you do that we will have your backs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8609.873s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And at the same time, I've seen wonderful examples in other communities of ways that these resistance methods that are getting distributed throughout the communities like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8620.343s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If we could have, you know, a house with a megaphone and some noisemakers on every block, you know, where we train people so that there's like a house with a megaphone and noisemakers on every block.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8628.385s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So if you know what to look for, and if you do, again, I'm not trying to be inflammatory for the sake of being inflammatory, it's just we know this is what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8637.288s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And what we need is a siren that goes off whenever ICE is there trying to kidnap people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8641.672s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that would be great if that could be Medford police.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8644.894s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But if it's not, it has to be the residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8646.856s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then ideally, our official public safety capacity can be a part of that too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8653.161s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm sorry if I've gone on a little bit long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8655.282s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I find it very fraught and challenging, the question of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8664.637s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As your representatives, I feel the responsibility that we should be able to fix this all on our own.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8668.818s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we can't, and we'll keep trying, but we have to enthusiastically collaborate with each other to resist this for as long as it takes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8683.141s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=790.31s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There will be a Medford City Council committee of the whole April 16 2025 this meeting will take place at 6pm in the city council chamber second floor, Medford City Hall, 85 George P has to drive Medford ma and via so Mr. Clerk, please call the role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=822.437s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=823.578s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Four present, three absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=825.739s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The meeting is called to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=827.74s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The action discussion item for this committee of the whole is paper 25-060 Community Development Block Grant, CDBG action plan for fiscal year 2026.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=838.505s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are joined by manager Siegel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=840.827s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for being here and funding recipients.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=844.008s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So the purpose of this meeting is to discuss the city's Community Development Block Grant annual action plan for community development and planning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=851.263s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The action plan contains the proposed use of CDBG funds for the program year, which extends from July 1st, 2025 through July 30th, 2026.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=861.288s">[Kit Collins]</a>: CDBG is a program of the U.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=863.589s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Department of Housing and Urban Development that began in 1974 and fiscal year 26 will be the city of Medford's program year 51 of CDBG funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=874.655s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=875.875s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I love a prime number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=876.695s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll turn it over to you, Manager Siegel, unless there are any preliminary comments from my fellow councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=883.577s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing none, please take it away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=1197.805s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=1199.166s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this is the proposed grantee ABCD and the amount of CDBG funds requested is $42,497.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=1207.673s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's $40,000 of CDBG funding received the prior year and the recommended amount for 2025 is 35,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=1212.917s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Am I reading that correctly, Manager Siegel?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=1221.844s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=1222.644s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=1223.045s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=1224.506s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Please state your names and addresses for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=1227.067s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A business address is fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=1228.748s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think in previous years, the council has found that a two to three minute overview is perfectly sufficient.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=1364.094s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for the overview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=1366.336s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are there any questions for ABCD from my fellow councillors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=1370.14s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=1413.852s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=1416.014s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=1417.435s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any additional questions from Councilors for ABCD?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=1422.119s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing none, thank you so much for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=1434.25s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=1434.946s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=1435.406s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this is Jaina Stafford from Housing Families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=1438.308s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I see the amount of CDBG funds requested as $22,800.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=1440.83s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Prior year funding was $20,000 and the recommended amount for program year 2025 is 19,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=1451.056s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Jaina, I'm going to click ask to unmute on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=1454.338s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just your name and business address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=1456.799s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=1463.752s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, I think you're live.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=1485.119s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think the clerk may try to work on that, but in the meantime, please feel free to go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=1489.383s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=1685.391s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=1685.931s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=1686.591s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I see Councilor Leming has a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=1688.453s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=1757.177s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=1764.29s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Jayna, we really appreciate it and thank you for your work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=1777.599s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you for being here, Pam, and I see the amount of CDBG funds requested at $29,717.50, amount received in the prior year, $27,000, and the recommended amount for program year 2025, $24,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=1785.943s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Where'd you go, Pam?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=1788.484s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Good evening, everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=1789.144s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sorry, I'm just trying to fix my camera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=1790.925s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, there we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=2016.114s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=2016.954s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for being with us, and thank you for your hard work all year round.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=2020.656s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=2021.016s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are there any questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=2275.037s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing none, thank you so much for your overview and yes I think that all Councilors can attest from what we hear from the community for, I mean, year after year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=2305.893s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I see that you did not apply last year, perhaps you're a first-time applicant, and the recommended amount is $9,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=2315.62s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Welcome, name and business address for the record, please, and thank you for being here to give us an overview today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=2467.513s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=2789.47s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it's always striking to hear about just how many distribution channels you have through our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=2793.891s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And also apart from the distribution itself, I think it's so meaningful to have the kind of statistics and bird's eye view of the problem of food insecurity in our community that you are able to help us apprehend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=2804.215s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3418.636s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any questions on this programming or comments from my fellow Councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3426.33s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3426.77s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just asked if there are any questions from my fellow councillors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3431.191s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I see none.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3433.132s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for the overview, Terry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3437.733s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3438.574s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are there any further questions or comments from councillors on any of the proposed grantees that we heard from tonight or the general plan for FY 26 for CDBG while we have manager Siegel?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3497.794s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3498.094s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's a very helpful clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3500.394s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, I'll go to Councilor Tseng, then Councilor Callahan, then Councilor Loewen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3603.886s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3604.266s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3606.147s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Saik.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3607.908s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Going to Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3669.076s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3672.958s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Did you have a hand up counseling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3679.781s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, I think I turned on the wrong one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3750.972s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you for your comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3752.333s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And yes, I want to echo the praise shared by my fellow Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3757.335s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is hard work, work that I do not envy having to divvy up limited funds for a whole host of organizations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3763.658s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're all doing deeply critical and laudable work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3766.499s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know that you and your team do that with extreme thoughtfulness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3769.741s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you so much for all of your work in making funding recommendations and reviewing proposed<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3777.164s">[Kit Collins]</a>: grantees and putting together the one in the five year action plans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3782.007s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3783.007s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is what we don't have a lot of good vibes meetings but personally I always end the CDBG proposed grantee meetings and the action plan meetings feeling a little bit warm and fuzzy because it's great to see how funding that we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3795.393s">[Kit Collins]</a>: as a city is going to direct service provision to our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3800.136s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that makes me feel really proud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3801.837s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I wanna thank all of the proposed grantees for sharing a little bit about your programming with the council tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3807.561s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And thank you manager Siegel for organizing and for teeing up this work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3813.944s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So the next step is a public hearing at the April 29th city council meeting, if I have that correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3833.836s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3834.957s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3835.297s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So residents can find that at MedFrontofMay.org slash CDBG if I have that right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3840.04s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's one of our few short URL slugs going around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3845.643s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So folks can check them out there for another month, I guess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3852.968s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll entertain a motion to refer this paper out of committee to regular session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3859.733s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll motion by Councilor Tseng to refer out of committee, seconded by Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3869.18s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, and I guess we're all here now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3871.681s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3873.703s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3875.364s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3876.425s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Before we adjourn, is there any public comment on anything that we heard tonight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3882.803s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You may raise your hand on zoom or come up to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3892.165s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing none, I'm shocked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3896.755s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to adjourn by Councilor Leming, seconded by Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3899.582s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All in favor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3901.065s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All opposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=3902.308s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3593.504s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bearson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3594.665s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I apologize to my colleagues for being late to the chambers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3596.787s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was listening on Zoom while commuting through heavy traffic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3604.304s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for the discussion so far and I appreciate everybody's patience with giving this process the time that it needs to get to the voting stage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3612.947s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And though we disagree, I appreciate Councilor Lazzaro's thoughtful consideration of my motion in our last meeting and the conversation that's followed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3620.51s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know we have a couple of ideas being floated in the past half hour or so, and one of the questions is, should we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3627.593s">[Kit Collins]</a>: vote to reinstate the mayor on the school committee or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3631.756s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I said a lot about my reasons for making the motion to remove the mayor from school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3636.64s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A week ago and I won't give that same spiel again, because all of my colleagues have heard it already and anybody else who's interested can find it online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3646.788s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So, just to with more brevity, explain my thinking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3657.427s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think with our review of the city charter, something that has been kind of in the back of my mind as we have considered various possible changes and adjustments that we could make to our current city charter, something that I have been kind of coming back to as we go along is this question of when is it worthwhile to make changes for the sake of change?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3682.084s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When is it worthwhile to make progress for the sake of doing things differently?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3687.908s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When is it important to hold out for different changes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3696.904s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A reason that I have not been more<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3700.001s">[Kit Collins]</a>: along throughout this process is that I am wary of Medford, all of us invested in things such as a new charter that will make our community better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3713.656s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I am wary of us spending momentum on changes, on a new charter<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3723.65s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that I believe that a new charter should meaningfully engage with the question of power and balance because that is a fundamental thing that the city charter decides for the city and then we live with that for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3734.756s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was wary of the city charter process that allowed us to spend our momentum and our energy for positive progress and change in productive ways but in ways that also deferred progress that I think that we really need to see such as renegotiating that question of power and balance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3755.099s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm not saying I'm the only one with the right opinion about this I'm saying that that has been heavy on my mind throughout this process because we deserve a product that is not only good, but great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3765.448s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And as Councilors we sign up to have the conversations and take as long as it takes to try to get to the product that we think best does that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3779.193s">[Kit Collins]</a>: To that end, thinking about what is my role, I want to speak for other Councilors, what is my role as a Councilor in this process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3784.616s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This was not a process that was initiated by the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3787.077s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a process that was initiated by the mayor, and it is our statutory responsibility to review the charter, make amendments, and then approve a version that will then go to the mayor and hopefully the voters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3800.044s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's one way of looking at my role as a Councilor on this process, saying my role is to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3807.623s">[Kit Collins]</a>: look at the draft city charter, make sure there's nothing glaringly problematic, and then vote it out so that the voters can decide either yes, this is worth doing or no, this is not meaningfully better than what we currently have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3819.849s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think there's another way of characterizing my role as a Councilor in this process, which is to say my role is to insist on an outcome that I think is so good, so meaningful, so important, that I would personally endorse and campaign for the outcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3834.837s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That is the attitude with which I have been approaching this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3838.425s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to the inconvenience of many, including myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3843.988s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I believe that this charter, unless it reimagines the balance of power in regard to the school committee and the city council, in regard to the other branches of government, I'm not saying it's not a good charter unless it does that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3858.896s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm saying it does not represent a meaningful change to the level of representation that residents will enjoy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3865.68s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's why<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3868.763s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's why I made my motion last week, and that's why this has been important to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3872.806s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Because as we've taken time to assimilate what we've been hearing in our inboxes and on phone calls and from the surveys and with our meetings, that has, at least to me, been what I interpret as the through line of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3884.233s">[Kit Collins]</a>: People are asking for increased representativeness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3887.075s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We had a lot of fights about what that meant for the city council, and I think those were productive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3890.537s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And as everybody knows, I backed off on 5-4.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3892.539s">[Kit Collins]</a>: 8-3, I think, is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3899.046s">[Kit Collins]</a>: clearly what most people would like to get the chance to vote on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3905.489s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But what I hear is that people want better representation, full stop, and they don't just mean the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3911.511s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that that has to include at least a beginning to ask the question of the balance of power between the mayor and the other two branches of government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3921.475s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that is why I will not be supporting the motion to put the mayor back on the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=5428.482s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=5430.164s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, while I was looking at the amendment proposed by Councilors Scarpelli in section nine for to change the first periodic review of the charter to within five years of the charter's approval I noticed in section nine for subsection<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=5446.525s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I believe a motion was passed one week ago to amend that section so that it would reflect three appointees of the mayor, three appointees of the city council, and three appointees of the school committee, but that is still reflected as four, three, and two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=5458.415s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I believe that motion passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=5472.147s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=5473.845s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=5474.265s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanted to flag that and make sure that it made it into the final version that we take a vote on tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=5480.808s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that there will be things that will have a variety of contentment with the draft that we vote on tonight, but I also want to make sure that our procedure for going forward is at least reflective of the motions that we made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=5498.56s">[Kit Collins]</a>: not about emotion, but I just want to state because of a couple of comments from a couple of different people that I've heard in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=5504.543s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Actually, it's a couple of comments that I've heard from elected in the past 15 minutes or so, and something that has characterized this process, not to mention a lot of other discussion topics before this Council this entire term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=5518.789s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that we do a really good job of talking to each other productively when we share<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=5523.659s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Our feelings and our preferences and our rationales and we make a lot of ground we have a lot of meetings we have a lot of productive conversations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=5530.604s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When we engage with a topic and we say why we feel a certain way on that topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=5537.068s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This chart review process in the city council chambers, in particular, has been characterized by.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=5545.495s">[Kit Collins]</a>: some people choosing not to explain why they feel the way that they do, but rather illustratively ascribing motivations to other people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=5558.497s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is really frustrating that not all electeds can just rest on the laurels of their own opinions and have to time and time again resort to the political manipulation of putting words in people's mouths, speculating about what the public will perceive in other people's actions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=5574.207s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just think it cheapens this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=5576.489s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I wish we could leave it in behind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=5578.31s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I hope that can die with this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=5579.931s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is really tiring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=5582.093s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It doesn't make any of us look good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=5585.775s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I hope that all electeds<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=5646.702s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just, I wanted to make a request that we sever the different aspects of that motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=5651.105s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When we take a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=5652.526s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=7610.671s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just want to check my understanding of what you just paraphrased.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=7614.652s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If a method for appointing a city officer department head or member of a multi member body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=7621.534s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The process for that if it is prescribed in the city charter or an ordinance, we just do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=7625.595s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And if it's not spoken to in the city charter or in any ordinance, then the process described in section two dash nine applies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=7636.743s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=7637.223s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That is my understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=9829.151s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=9833.013s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=0.291s">[Kit Collins]</a>: a draft proposal for the West Medford zoning proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=4.972s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is the very first time we'll be looking at a preliminary proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=8.253s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is by no means the last time we'll be looking at this proposal before it proceeds along in the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=15.395s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The object of tonight is to review a presentation giving us an overview of the proposal by NS Associates that will acquaint us with the boundaries of the West Medford Square zoning district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=30.899s">[Kit Collins]</a>: preliminary proposals for which areas, which blocks should be which sub-districts and why the goals of this zoning and how that aligns with the overall goals of the comprehensive citywide zoning project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=44.638s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Folks who have been regularly attending this meetings will know this already, but the West Medford Square and also the Medford Square proposal also still in progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=54.304s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These two proposals follow on the heels of kind of a more general discussion of our approach to commercial and mixed use, sorry, mixed use areas in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=62.99s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think about a month ago, we held an initial discussion on a commercial framework for the remaining corridors and squares throughout Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=72.617s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There was a lot of public comment on that kind of bird's eye view, 30,000 foot view discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=79.799s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One comment that we did hear quite frequently, I think, in my opinion, was that people were very specifically asking for height and density in West Medford Square to support it as a more vibrant commercial square to piggyback off of its kind of unique location with the commuter rail stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=98.226s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it's true of West Medford Square as it is with the rest of this citywide zoning project that I think wherever we look as we kind of look all around the city to do these updates and these re-evaluations, our goal is to preserve what we love about these places, preserve the uniqueness of each of these space, each square, each corridor, each neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=117.858s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and to make sure that we're preserving what we love about those places, but not down zoning everywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=124.261s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We know that we need development, we need to support development, we need to vastly increase housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=128.583s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we're looking to do that in each square, in each corridor, in each neighborhood in a way that is tailored to each square, corridor, neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=134.926s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that applies to West Medford Square as it does to each of our zoning topics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=142.97s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Before I hand it over to Paula I just wanted to mention because I know there are folks who are attending tonight who are maybe new to this process, because they're West Medford residents or business owners who haven't been involved in the zoning overhaul process previously just to state this in the context of the rest of the kind of the arc of the overhaul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=161.125s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This proposal, this draft proposal, this draft proposal process for West Medford Square has been preceded by many other topics in the Citywide Zoning Review timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=173.168s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The first package that the City Council ordained was the Mystic Avenue Corridor District that was back last fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=179.793s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We then followed by ordaining a green score rubric, which updates environmental and climate resiliency related incentives and rewards for rewards for developers and major building projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=192.841s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We ordained the Salem Street corridor district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=197.955s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Currently in process is the neighborhood and urban residential zoning topic, which is going to have its second date before the Community Development Board this month, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=208.558s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Medford Square zoning proposal is also in progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=211.119s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's still in this committee and updates to the ADU ordinance is still in progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=215.64s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It has not yet been referred out of this committee either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=218.841s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this is one piece of a citywide process, and we welcome everybody's participation and involvement in as much of this project interests them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=232.294s">[Kit Collins]</a>: With that, Paola, if there's no initial comments from any of my fellow councilors or from city staff, I'd love to turn it over to Paola to begin her presentation about the draft West Medford Square zoning proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=248.747s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=249.167s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I see that Councilor Scarpelli is with us as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=260.878s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=262.019s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=263.18s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing no hands raised and the chambers are on zoom for my fellow Councilors, I'll turn it over to Paola whenever you're ready to begin the presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1237.964s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1238.344s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for that overview, Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1240.885s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1241.825s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So again, it's the first time that we're viewing this proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1245.887s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is just a draft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1246.747s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're not going to be taking any votes tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1248.267s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is not the last time we're going to be talking about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1250.368s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is just the very first step in this process of iteratively creating the proposal that will then be sent on to the Community Development Board and then back to the City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1264.656s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So having taken that in, first we'll do comments and questions, suggestions and preferences from councillors and city staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1273.52s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When all that has been pretty well depleted, at the end of the meeting, we will go to all public comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1280.023s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I see non-voting member Councilor Lazzaro has her hand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1283.805s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll go to you first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1285.866s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Please go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1361.863s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1362.824s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And yeah, Paula, if you're able to speak to just a little bit, I know there's the train station is already woven into the fabric of West Medford Square, but if you could speak just maybe a little bit to how that factored into the preliminary design of the interplay of mixed use around the train station, where it is in the center of the square, and how we could see that being part of the transition into the residential areas around West Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1396.657s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think Councilor Lazzaro was just looking for like a little bit of an explanation around how do you approach integrating the train station into the fabric of the square the surrounding residential area in this updated version of the zoning proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1412.107s">[Kit Collins]</a>: what I see from this original, from this preliminary map, is that it's, you know, mixed use to match with that heavy use that's already there, and then the gradient into mixed use too, and urban residential too, but if you could speak just a little bit to maybe the process there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1546.958s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll go back to Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1668.563s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you Councilor will go to President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1800.155s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1802.177s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And yeah, I think it's generally not the first thing that I think to bring up when we're talking about these new mixed-use sub-districts, but I do think it's very relevant to the discussion, especially in a district like West Medford Square, that a type of sub-district like this and the type of development that allows by right<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1823.306s">[Kit Collins]</a>: allows the type of development that is large enough in scale and scope that it could be a partner to the city in the kind of transformational development that we've been wanting to do for a long time and the kind of transformational development that would allow us to cohere some of the neighborhood, just have it integrate better with the railway infrastructure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1846.886s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So to me, that is another<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1850.192s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That is another benefit of integrating this mixed use zoning, especially concentrated in the square and along the rail line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1859.898s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go ahead, Director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1981.277s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1981.637s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that could be a really interesting thing for us to look at and for this committee to discuss as we go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1988.881s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've had some discussion before about tweaking the incentive zoning structure is something that we'll continue to do throughout this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=1995.625s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think that the incentive zoning table is by any means baked and we have had some discussion about which incentives will apply citywide and which are gonna be tailored to different districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2011.304s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you for putting that on the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2012.906s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm going to make a note of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2014.107s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sure our consultants will as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2022.597s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2023.678s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing no other further hands raised from my fellow Councilors, I'll just give a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2028.834s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, I'll go back to Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2032.316s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, that was a different hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2037.138s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well, the purpose of this meeting is to get our initial two cents on the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2041.64s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'll just give my my first reaction to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2047.69s">[Kit Collins]</a>: our first look at the zoning proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2050.312s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that this is a really strong place to be starting in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2053.695s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I feel really good about this map as the first thing that we look at in this proposal process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2059.3s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Like I mentioned at the beginning of the meeting, I think our goal is with any zoning proposal that's a part of this process is to match existing by right heights or build upon them where it's appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2072.257s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And this proposal does that, as was shown in the maps in the presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2077.905s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Currently, the zoning for a lot of the center of West Medford Square is already six stories by right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2084.617s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's a lot of apartment one, which is three stories by right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2088.82s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think it's really appropriate for us to be looking at this map and considering next use to be kind of as a default for a lot of that commercial center, because I think what I have heard from a lot of constituents so far is they'd like to see increased development potential in West Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2112.405s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And given what's already allowed by right, I think that mixed use 2B allows that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2119.747s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Another thing that pops out to me comparing this proposed draft with the map of the current zoning for West Medford Square is that this is a really cool opportunity for us to create a more thoughtful gradient from the center of West Medford Square into the kind of surrounding neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2137.951s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We were looking at the current zoning map earlier,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2140.312s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, we have a lot of those six story by right three story by right, and then it's surrounded by a ring of single family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2145.613s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's just a really abrupt drop off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2147.453s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2149.794s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We should absolutely consider and present to the public a map more like this one that has that central ring of six stories by right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2157.895s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Four story by right next used to a where where it makes sense where mixed used to be doesn't make sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2163.256s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then the step down employing you are too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2165.936s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that we should employ you are too pretty intensively around here because of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2170.445s">[Kit Collins]</a>: commuter rail stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2173.227s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Something that we've been trying to prioritize throughout the zoning map is ground floor commercial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2179.271s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And obviously that's something that people already, you know, I would say both love and miss about West Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2185.816s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We love the ground floor commercial that's there and we miss the storefronts that we used to be able to patronize that have been vacant for a really long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2193.161s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think people are really, really eager<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2196.341s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to see those storefronts get filled again and mixed use zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2200.365s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is true citywide is like a way for us to allow that by right while also allowing the residential units by right that will support that commercial base.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2208.674s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's part of the reason that I think we should be looking at mixed use to be as a default here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2215.258s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A point that was raised during our ongoing discussion of neighborhood and urban residential is that with the mixed use zoning, being able to add more housing units on upper floors through those increased by right heights has a benefit in that it allows us to free up a little bit more of our green space on those lots potentially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2236.414s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is, in some cases, a developer decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2239.256s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It allows us to not need to use so much of the footprint of a lot<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2245.141s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For adding housing units.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2246.123s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that we are so really It gives us an opportunity to think about how does increased development increased density interplay with protecting green space in West Medford square and with the residential areas surrounding it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2257.259s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2261.996s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I have some specifics in mind where I'd like to see us consider expanding mixed-use 2B, where there's currently mixed-use 2A in this initial draft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2273.083s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Harbord Ave is one of those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2278.646s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just a question about the map itself, actually, Paola, if you don't mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2282.208s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There are some lines that are solid black line, and then there's others that are dotted black line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2288.743s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then there's other areas on this map that are colored in but outside of the boundary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2293.489s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Could you explain like what folks are looking at with the solid line dotted line and then I assume that the areas outside of the line are the currently included in the neighborhood and urban residential proposal, but could you clarify that please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2372.568s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2374.749s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for clarifying that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2375.909s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's really helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2377.49s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'll be very curious to hear from community members and my fellow councillors on their thoughts on the proposed extension of the West Medford Square boundary<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2390.28s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know for myself, I'm looking at Harvard Ave and wondering if it makes sense to continue it all the way down Harvard Ave to where it, or it continues all the way down on Harvard Ave on the Northwest side, but not the Southeast side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2406.974s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Maybe that can be one area to consider.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2409.116s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'll be curious for other suggestions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2411.998s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, Director Hunt, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2420.493s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, down to Boston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2540.14s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2540.601s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that this is kind of the right time to be talking about that, because this map is in a very, very early stage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2546.247s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go to President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2547.108s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And also, I just want to clarify, because I see some hands raised on Zoom, we will get to all public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2551.813s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll do that following discussion by committee members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2555.898s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go ahead, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2652.79s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2653.11s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2655.292s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And, um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2657.465s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is true that in addition to these kind of more major squares and corridor discussions, we are also going to have a discussion about kind of mixed use nodes that are very intentionally in the fabric of neighborhoods that are smaller in scale ways so that there can be by right<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2676.375s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, amenities, neighborhood stuff, convenience stores, restaurants, et cetera, in neighborhoods outside of just the major squares to be useful to people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2686.397s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that, I think this is a good time to be talking about that and we can continue to discuss if it makes sense as part of this process or if it should be part of the neighborhood nodes process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2697.68s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm gonna go to Planner Evans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2777.605s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2778.106s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, so broadly, it sounds like we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2791.612s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If we have reactions to specific sub-district assignments in this early draft, and also initial thoughts on where the district boundary makes sense and where we might want to see it extended or earmarked for a future discussion as part of the mixed use neighborhood notes discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2813.846s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I also, because I forgot to, I do think Director Hunt makes a really good point, especially now that we're<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2820.502s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, in earlier parts of this process, we didn't have kind of the fully realized neighborhood residential proposal to look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2827.304s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Now that we do, I think it would be helpful in future discussions if we could look at those side by side, at least in one slide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2834.226s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it could help us bring up some things that we'd want to discuss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2840.148s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just for now, my last two cents on the topic of where we might extend this boundary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2847.615s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think I'd I'd put on the record that yeah I would see kind of extent so the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2854.423s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the side of Harvard Ave closer to the river.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2856.104s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I could see that being made into a parallel line extending the district boundary all the way down to Boston Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2863.028s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I would want to consider that, just have a discussion about that in the context of the commercial, the restaurants that are on the other side of Boston Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2873.394s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Because I think that could be relevant as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2875.355s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know there's a lot of beloved restaurants right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2877.416s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And they would kind of, I think they're relevant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2879.717s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that that kind of mini commercial area is relevant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2886.435s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears, is that a new hand raised or if it is, feel free to go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2892.337s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2897.319s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are there any other comments at this time from councilors or city staff initial reactions to this draft?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2909.144s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Things we wanna get on the record, suggestions, questions for how this draft should evolve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2915.727s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2926.635s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, hearing none, we can begin with public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2932.538s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Unless there's anything else that city staff want to add.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=2937.221s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we will just give me a second to get set up with my.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3004.257s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for flagging that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3005.698s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go to President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3073.001s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for flagging that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3080.322s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, is that a hand?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3082.124s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go ahead, Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3088.889s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was also thrown off by that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3090.13s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3186.236s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you for that Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3190.684s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any additional notes at this time by city staff or committee members?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3196.891s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing none.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3198.032s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, great, well, I know there are a lot of people here to give their thoughts on this preliminary proposal, so we'll go to public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3206.678s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We will switch between podium and Zoom, though the people on Zoom vastly outnumber the people in the council chambers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3214.664s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Every participant will have three minutes to speak, and I'll endeavor to remember to alert people when they are coming up on 30 seconds left.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3228.66s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So if you're in the chambers, feel free to just line up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3231.062s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go first to Emily on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3234.226s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Please give your name and address for the record and I'll start the timer for three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3238.291s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just asked you to unmute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3245.279s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3245.62s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3331.382s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you and please feel free if you have more questions, feel free to say them all at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3334.544s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We can get to your questions at the end of your three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3337.867s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Nope, that's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3339.397s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3340.157s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3342.978s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3343.718s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So the two circles and just saying this for anybody who doesn't know it already, the inner one is a the quarter mile radius from the train stop and the outer circle is the half mile radius from the train stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3356.922s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I believe that everything not included in the squares proposal, everything that's not colored in would be encompassed by our neighborhood and urban<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3365.894s">[Kit Collins]</a>: PB, Lisa Smith-Miyazaki, she-her-hers, she-her-hers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3430.232s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you so much, Paola, and thank you, Emily, for your comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3435.597s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go next to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3436.918s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3437.979s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3442.224s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3569.802s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, William.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3574.072s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, we'll go back to Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3578.214s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll go to Jennifer Yanko.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3579.734s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll ask you to unmute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3580.975s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3583.376s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And you have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3588.818s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go ahead, Jennifer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3594.38s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, we can hear you now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3595.72s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3596.061s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3761.809s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you so much, Jennifer, for your comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3766.891s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I just wanted to highlight, we will work on getting a version of the updated proposal superimposed on what we did for Neighborhood and Urban Residential when we were further along in the process as we superimposed the proposal on top of the current zoning and on top of, yeah, on top of the current zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3788.621s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sure that we can do that for this proposal superimpose it on top of the current zoning, and also situated within the context of the neighborhood and urban residential zoning which will surround it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3798.252s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that'll be helpful for folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3800.395s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In the meantime, President Bears did pop into the chat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3804.279s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the section of the City Council's public portal where you can see the proposals for the neighborhood and urban residential zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3812.545s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So everybody, please do check that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3815.266s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And hopefully that will give everybody a good start on absorbing some more of that context.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3822.492s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then I think we can, I'm sure we can follow up with super superimposed imagery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3826.695s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go ahead, Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3888.304s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3889.425s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3891.727s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just while we're talking about the other materials on neighborhood and urban residential that are available right now, there's the link in the chat that President Bears dropped.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3900.915s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then if anybody looks that up and fails to bookmark it and wants to see it again, if you go to medfordma.org slash zoning, those same diagrams are available there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3913.279s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, we'll go to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3916.421s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes, we'll go back to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=4580.933s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for your comments, Judith.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=4582.394s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=4584.195s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=4587.195s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Something that was discussed in brief when we were looking at the section studies just earlier, and we kind of spent a little more time talking about this in the context of West, sorry in the context of Medford Square actually something that we'll revisit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=4600.959s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sure both with Medford Square and West Medford Square are opportunities with the mixed use zoning for covered parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=4611.622s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Obviously, I hope it goes without saying, but it shouldn't that, you know, certainly in West Medford squares and elsewhere, we're conscious that we really need to prioritize land area for uses for residential for commercial, but we're not unaware of the need for parking, both for the active business area and for the commercial and for the commuter rail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=4635.986s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And Paula and Emily from the associates team so far I've done a really great job of presenting some I think novel and very compelling ways that we could integrate parking into the fabric of some of these mixed use developments so that it doesn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=4651.884s">[Kit Collins]</a>: doesn't necessarily monopolize some of the area that could be put to productive use and developments, but does retain some parking in and around the square for those who will continue to need it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=4664.267s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I see that Paula has put up one of those slides on the screen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=4667.768s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Do you want to speak to that just briefly, just kind of an overview of what some of these mixed uses enable in terms of covered parking, just for context?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=4788.332s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you so much for that overview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=4790.333s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll certainly, we can revisit that topic and those possibilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=4795.736s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sure that we will in future discussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=4799.258s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=4800.239s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I see no further hands raised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=4801.52s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So there are just a few emailed comments that I'm going to read into the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=4811.285s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This one is from Dave McKenna to Vine Street who requested this read aloud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=4817.773s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Dave says, I am very supportive of the changes that have been made to allow more development in West Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=4823.4s">[Kit Collins]</a>: However, I would like to make a few additional suggestions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=4826.845s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You are too should be allowed to go to four stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=4830.86s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The area under consideration could be expanded one more block to the west with mixed use one, which is three stories by right, plus one story with incentive zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=4840.226s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On the south side of High Street at the west end of this plan, there is already mixed use one block beyond the limit of this plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=4847.37s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On the north side, this is within a stone's throw from the commuter station, and I believe MX1 would be appropriate additional density while stepping down from the center of the square towards the residential neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=4859.649s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The area under consideration could also be expanded to the east one to two blocks with MX1 to step down away from the center of the square and expand the corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=4867.838s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think the MX1 doesn't have to require ground floor commercial, it could be left optional so that based on the evolving needs of the area, it could be residential or mixed use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=4880.972s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That was Dave's comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=4883.335s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There are a couple others that indicated they wanted to submit comments tonight, but they didn't specifically say they wanted their comments read into the record, so I will read them but not use names, just in case the commenter would not have preferred that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=4895.847s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One says,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=4899.173s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Since I can't attend the committee meeting tonight, I'm submitting this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=4902.496s">[Kit Collins]</a>: While I applaud the citywide zoning effort all around, I would like to see the proposal for West Medford go further to increase density in the proposed district and to expand the boundaries of the mixed use and urban residential district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=4915.505s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In particular, I would like to see all of High Street from the Brooks School down to the Rotary by the river, as well as Boston Ave from High Street to the river, be some combination of mixed use and urban residential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=4926.329s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This would be reflective of the land uses that are there now and create more opportunities to expand housing in an area that has good transit service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=4938.814s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And the final one in my inbox.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=4942.373s">[Kit Collins]</a>: simply reads, any chance the business on Harvard Ave could change to mixed-use 2B?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=4949.102s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Currently, it's mixed-use 2A.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=4956.451s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go ahead, Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=5003.006s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=5003.507s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=5008.152s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, well, we've gotten a lot of reactions and suggestions on the record this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=5014.658s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=5016.319s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I feel like there's a general coherent interest in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=5023.08s">[Kit Collins]</a>: continuing the conversation around where these boundaries make sense and where we'd like to see them extended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=5028.061s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we've gotten a lot of suggestions for where certain sub districts could be tweaked to go from 2A to 2B, from 2B to 3.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=5036.363s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And a lot of interest in the next time we look at this, considering it side by side with the context of the residential areas surrounding which will also help us continue the discussion of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=5045.925s">[Kit Collins]</a>: where this district boundary should end and where we should be making that shift from mixed use to residential and how dense that residential should be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=5057.627s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=5058.487s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm excited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=5058.947s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you all so much for a very substantive discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=5062.528s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Lots for NS associates and city staff and myself to take back and make sure it is considered and incorporated into the next version of this proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=5073.25s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So since I don't see any additional hands raised from members of the public or committee members, I'll just give a quick overview of next steps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=5082.571s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We will meet in committee about this proposal again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=5087.455s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think, Polly, you may have said in your presentation like a draft next date for this proposal, but if you did, I missed it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=5095.645s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have a number of proposals that are all currently in progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=5100.271s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, did you have a date for that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=5101.273s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to say it if you did, but it's okay if you don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=5114.796s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No, that's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=5115.336s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=5133.817s">[Kit Collins]</a>: great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=5134.197s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=5135.978s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we will be discussing this proposal at our next planning and permitting committee, and it sounds like probably alongside the Medford Square proposal as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=5143.341s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Those will be April 30.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=5144.982s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All of these dates will be updated on the city's zoning website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=5149.464s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so we'll have another chance for committee members and members of the public and city staff to discuss them in this public meeting before the committee will potentially take a vote to refer it to the Community Development Board, where we'll have public hearings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=5165.235s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So please save the date, April 30, if you want to be at the next Planning and Permitting Committee meeting about this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=5175.999s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Myself with President Bears, Director Hunt, and NS Associates are also working to schedule our next several public Q&As about this topic and many others, as you can see on this timeline in green.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=5188.843s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are working out locations for those, so as soon as we have all of the details firmed up, we'll be sure to be publicizing those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=5198.946s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are there any additional questions or comments before we close out for the evening?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=5208.688s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing none, thank you all so much for your questions and suggestions, and thank you so much, Paola, for the presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=5215.43s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is there a motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=5217.868s">[Kit Collins]</a>: hear a motion to adjourn from Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=5219.909s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is there a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=5222.631s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seconded by President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=5225.532s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=5251.199s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=5251.801s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Five in favor, none opposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=5253.404s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=5254.386s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=1423.06s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There will be a meeting of the Medford City Council Committee of the whole April 8 2025.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=1428.744s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This meeting will take place at 5.30pm in the city council chamber second floor Medford City Hall, 85 George B has to drive Medford ma and via zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=1438.531s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=1457.717s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=1458.598s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That is five present, two running late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=1461.81s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The meeting is called to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=1463.451s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The action discussion items for this evening is resolution 25048 offered by myself, a resolution to meet on parking department surveillance report, the Green Line Extension parking zone, and parking ordinance updates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=1478.677s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we're going to go in, I think, that order, and we'll see how much we can get through tonight, hopefully all of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=1482.999s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And if not, we'll schedule a follow-up committee of the whole expeditiously to get to whatever we don't get to tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=1492.42s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sure, Councilor Scarpellile.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=1517.772s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Wait, I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=1518.772s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What was the request?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=1547.282s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=1547.882s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think I'm I apologize that it wasn't listed on the action discussion items I think the intent was that we could ask those of the parking director while he's here for the GLX update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=1556.964s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=1559.465s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we'll go in that order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=1561.488s">[Kit Collins]</a>: First to the review of the parking department surveillance impact reports and use policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=1568.259s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So as a quick overview, these are parts of reporting requirements that are mandated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=1573.998s">[Kit Collins]</a>: under the Community Control over Public Surveillance Ordinance, which was ordained in 2023.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=1582.701s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All city departments that use surveillance technology must complete certain reporting requirements, they must have an impact report for the surveillance technology that they use, they must have a use policy,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=1595.265s">[Kit Collins]</a>: for the surveillance technology that they use, and this must be annually reviewed and approved by the City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=1600.838s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's also an annual report submitted by the city agency that's using the surveillance technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=1606.723s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and an annual report that is compiled by the city council that kind of compiles all of this information into one publicly accessible report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=1614.788s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this is the first time that we're having the parking department before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=1618.41s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They have one surveillance technology in use, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=1622.632s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And thank you for being here to present and thank you for the timely application of the impact report and use policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=1629.356s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilors had this in their packets to review before this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=1633.399s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'd like to invite up parking director<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=1636.136s">[Kit Collins]</a>: MacDermott, to give a brief overview of anything that you'd like to say, Jermaine, to the use policy, the impact report, the technology that we're talking about are the automatic license plate readers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=1647.36s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And if you could give an overview, you know, just you don't have to read word for word from the report, but just an overview of what these are, how they pertain to like what the surveillance element is, why the parking department uses them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=1659.384s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That would be helpful to kick off the discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=1660.785s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=1761.545s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=1762.345s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are there any initial questions from councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=1769.048s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing none, would you mind also giving an overview of the impact report that you supplied to the council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=1774.09s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just the headlines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2023.546s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you and I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2025.568s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that this is kind of the the intent of the city working together to put these kind of safeguards around surveillance technology so that we can make sure that there's a structure for exactly that kind of checking and rigor which is to say<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2038.51s">[Kit Collins]</a>: any access to surveillance data or surveillance technology that does not have to exist, should not exist, because it makes us all a little less safe and less cyber secure in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2047.274s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2049.815s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll keep an eye out for questions from my, oh, I see one question from Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2054.697s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go again, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2218.146s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2220.595s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you for that answer I appreciate that and great to know that this has already been at least raised to sense energy techno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2227.318s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know for myself and this brings up a question that I was going to kind of the question around the longevity of this data both locally and with G techna and sense and.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2238.138s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it would be useful in the use policy to have some language that specifies like a concrete sunlighting date for the data, whether it is stored locally, and some clarity around the municipal records retention schedules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2252.41s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that those are citywide, but I think that people are generally familiar with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2256.814s">[Kit Collins]</a>: what that actually dictates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2257.915s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it would be a helpful amendment to the use policy to see that specified how long this data is being stored.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2264.219s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I can understand that it needs to be stored for some amount of time in case somebody wants to make an appeal, which they should be able to do, of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2271.144s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think it'd be helpful to have some concrete language about for how long is it remaining.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2286.9s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2287.3s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And according, and kind of going along with that, sorry, looking back at my notes here, I think that it would also, it sounds like the information that we've received from CENCEN and GTECNA so far is that there's no indication that they have any agreements with other entities to use the data that is transferred back to them in any kind of way, which is great to hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2311.039s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's what I'd like to assume.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2312.24s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it would be helpful to have that, some language around that and like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2315.864s">[Kit Collins]</a>: even if it's an annual confirmation of that in our contract with them written into the use policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2321.908s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that is in a lot of cases with surveillance data and surveillance technology, you know, it's kind of the concentric circles of it all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2328.672s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's not just, is it secure here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2330.614s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is it secure with the people who have access to it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2332.135s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is it secure with the people who created the software that allows us to get this data in the first place?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2337.838s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So if that could be kind of a related amendment in the use policy, just that we're confirming with the people who enable the surveillance technology that it is also,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2346.107s">[Kit Collins]</a>: not being transferred, not being sold, not being shared, and like a very specific sunlight date on their end as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2351.633s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that would be very valuable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2353.514s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2354.816s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2358.239s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing no other further questions from councillors at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2362.363s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just had one other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2368.457s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let me pull up the section of the, this is on the, still on the use policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2374.919s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For number six, you mentioned, and you spoke to this at this time, the parking department is not seeking to share access of the technology or the data with any other agency, department, bureau, division, or unit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2387.924s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2388.485s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2389.685s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it would be helpful just to shore up that language to make it a declaration of this is something that will not happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2395.295s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Not only are we not intending for it to happen right now, this is something that we are not allowing within the parameters of this technology's use, would be a helpful amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2414.024s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any other questions, comments, concerns, compliments from other councilors on the parking department's impact report or use policy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2427.839s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing none.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2430.941s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we just caught along to few hopefully quick amendments to the records retention, some confirmations there and a quick amendment to the use policy section six to state affirmatively, you know, the switch from no intent to share access to will not share access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2446.21s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If that can be updated and then submitted back to the council next week to be included in our annual surveillance reporting, that would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2460.055s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2461.416s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is there any public comment on this item before we proceed to the next item on our agenda?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2468.943s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, come on up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2470.464s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2654.874s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thanks, Barry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2658.502s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is there any additional public comment on this item?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2714.521s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2714.781s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2715.121s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Feel free to approach the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2782.041s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for that context.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2787.463s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2788.663s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing no additional public comment on this item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2791.525s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, councillors, Nina, Sarah, members of the committee for the review of these documents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2799.088s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for, again, for your thoroughness and timeliness with this very first submission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2803.349s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Appreciate it, especially you being, well, not really that new to the department, but appreciate it anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2812.098s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, moving right along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2813.459s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Our second topic is updates about the Green Line Extension parking program and other related questions about the parking program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2823.206s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I know you've prepared an overview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=2827.029s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Please feel free to give us an overview of the GLX program, how it's been going so far, whatever you think is germane to the topic, and then we can entertain questions from Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=3012.446s">[Kit Collins]</a>: long term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=3015.148s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=3015.548s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just super briefly, we don't have a lot of attendees and chambers are on Zoom this evening, but just in case there are folks watching online who are kind of new to this issue, could you just in like a snapshot explain the goals of the G-Zone parking program and just in general the geographic area that it sits over?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=3163.013s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=3163.854s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=3164.954s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And as a G-Zone resident, that matches my experience as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=3170.017s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli, we'll go to you for questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=3707.627s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Director I agree I think that I think will be worthwhile I there is some great information about the green line zone on the city website, it's been up there for a while and I think the Councilors point to sound that it<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=3720.75s">[Kit Collins]</a>: people like things to be really at their fingertips, and it has been a while since the G zone was piloted, since it was codified as permanent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=3730.175s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that, you know, more information is always better to make sure that it reaches people here in this, you know, rather fragmented information environment that we have here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=3738.44s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I will say for myself, again, as a resident of the G zone, I really like it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=3743.002s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's a huge improvement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=3744.363s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, it's not my job to proselytize for the zoned parking, but I find myself wanting to just because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=3750.091s">[Kit Collins]</a>: living in that neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=3750.932s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's a vast improvement and I think it would be helpful for there to be more readily available information about what are the reasons why this was instituted in the first place to help people understand the pros in addition to the changes or some of their perceived cons as we continue to get used to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=3791.992s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=3792.672s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=3795.094s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is there any other questions or comments from Councilors on the G-Zone or other related parking enforcement?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=3809.645s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing none, and none on Zoom, is there any public comment or questions about this topic?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=3820.387s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing none, thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=3822.747s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Really appreciate the overview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=3826.428s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And thank you for your work in the parking department, an undersung but important department in our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=3837.905s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, on to our last topic for the evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=3840.326s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are making good time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=3842.728s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This bodes well for the rest of our evening, knock on wood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=3847.29s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The third topic is the proposed ordinance change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=3853.593s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let me, sorry, I X'd out of my agenda, but I think had the information about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=3865.982s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes, so this is a proposed amendment from the city administration regarding Chapter 78 Article 3 Division 2 Subsection 1 Section 78-173 pertaining to municipal employee and business parking in back of City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=3882.839s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Would you like to give an overview of the what and the why of this proposed amendment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=3999.747s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If I'm reading this correctly, this would be to repeal the use of one of these lots as the overflow lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4055.951s">[Kit Collins]</a>: OK, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4057.291s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And sorry, just to double confirm, the lot that's being repealed for visitor use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4077.182s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's just the area immediately around City Hall in back is just for City Hall employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4082.485s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then visitors can park like the next lot over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4088.709s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4090.91s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I really need a diagram in front of me at all times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4094.243s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4097.284s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that would be repealing the visitor parking during business hours provision, so it remains as only an overflow lot for municipal employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4105.368s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4105.908s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4107.089s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any questions or comments from my fellow councillors on this proposed change?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4113.071s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4113.752s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, my computer screen is not big enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4117.874s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go ahead, Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4121.575s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, can you hear me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4415.901s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for that overview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4416.921s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this is reasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4419.842s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we certainly have a lot of parking in the square very close to City Hall that people can also take advantage of I hope that decreases all over time, and as our transit system improves and you don't need to have quite so much parking surrounding City Hall but given that we now do I don't think that this is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4438.749s">[Kit Collins]</a>: a bad change to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4441.71s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would request, I'm sure that this is, I'm absolutely positive this is a policy you've discussed already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4446.692s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it would be great to see a 30 day warning period before tickets are given out, just so that people can adjust their habits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4456.035s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm seeing nods, so I see this as something you were already thinking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4520.791s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4521.592s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4522.012s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sounds like the ducks are in a row on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4524.673s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are there any additional questions or comments from Councilors on this proposed change?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4532.477s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing none.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4536.619s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4538.906s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the overview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4544.094s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So let me just get organized here with the motions to come out of this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4551.616s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that we will need a few emotion to receive and place on file, the impact report and use policy for the parking department, and that's of course this doesn't need to be in motion but that's what the expectation that the updated version will be coming this week ahead of the annual reporting deadline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4569.348s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A second motion to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4575.852s">[Kit Collins]</a>: request more communication from the parking department and the city administration about the G zone parking program to distribute to residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4584.614s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is there anything you wanted to add to that Councilor Scarpelli?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4592.235s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think my colleagues like to second that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4594.456s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4596.316s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then I think we could use a third motion to approve, to report out of committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4605.036s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4605.256s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's the motion to let's finish the sentence report out of committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4610.838s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The proposed repeal of chapter 73, article three, division two, subsection one, section 78, one 73.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4621.481s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll let the clerk catch up and copy and paste from the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4630.523s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, I will restate to you in just a sec.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4657.405s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, so these three motions are all by Councilor Scarpelli and seconded by Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4663.129s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They are to receive and place on file the parking department's impact report and use policy for ALPRs, to request more information and communications on the G-Zone parking program from the parking director and city administration, and to report out of committee the repeal of the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4689.144s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and I can send you this text if that's helpful, Mr. Clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4695.585s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, will do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4696.305s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, on the motion by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4701.526s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4731.812s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=4734.053s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So seven here, seven in favor zero opposed motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=5047.431s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=5048.431s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll go to President Bears and then we'll circle back to our final two motions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=5075.361s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=5075.942s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=5079.354s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing no further comments or hands on zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=5083.895s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we have a couple other motions to vote through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=5086.916s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So the second one is the request for more info and communications on G zone parking program from the parking director and city administration, Mr. Clark whenever you're ready please call the role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=5114.833s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=5115.633s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seven in favor, zero opposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=5117.494s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=5118.915s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And on the final motion to report out of committee, the ordinance repeal that we just discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=5126.24s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Whenever you're ready.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=5132.504s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=5139.014s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes, seven in favor, none opposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=5143.916s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=5146.077s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for, yep, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=5174.526s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's probably fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=5175.626s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't want to speak for other Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=5179.948s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I doubt that I will have further questions on the topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=5182.729s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If I do, I'll try to email them ahead of time and encourage other Councilors to do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=5188.222s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that's the best I got.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=5190.043s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Understood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=5190.604s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=5191.184s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=5191.565s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=5192.786s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=5193.226s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for your presence with us for this multi-topic committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=5198.39s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Really appreciate your time and all your hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=5201.152s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is there a motion to adjourn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=5206.797s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On the motion by Councilor Tseng to adjourn, seconded by President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Pxcn3Cfi7h8&t=5211.641s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=1439.568s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=1441.229s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The planning and permitting committee on March 26th met to discuss two additional topics that are part of our comprehensive citywide zoning overhaul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=1450.454s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The topics discussed at this meeting was the first topic meeting for the Medford Square zoning proposal<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=1457.897s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I believe our second look at updates to the ADU's ordinance, we will meet on both of these topics again before they are reported out of committee and referred to the Community Development Board for public hearings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=1470.182s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2591.663s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2591.963s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I wanted to thank you again for coming before us to again, describe this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2597.464s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For folks who weren't at the previous presentations that the city council received on this, just to quickly paraphrase the overview that you gave, my understanding is this is to support the urgent and necessary HVAC repairs and roof repairs so that when kids go back to school in the fall, they'll have functioning air conditioning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2617.828s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and non-leaky roofs to enjoy at the start of the new school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2621.409s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Very glad that we can support that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2624.55s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm so glad to hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2625.671s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Obviously, taking on a major capital expense is not something that any of us take lightly, but I'm glad that this project is one whose scale enables us to do those ADA upgrades that I know people in the community have been asking for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2638.234s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for your diligence around that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2640.735s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate all of the documentation for continuing to keep the council abreast of this and I would motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3905.635s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3907.498s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just want to share my gratitude for this Councilors for the sponsors for shepherding through this draft which strongly and boldly defines protections for seekers of gender affirming and reproductive health care in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3918.259s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This draft has gone through a careful legal review, and its sponsors, Councilors Sang and Lazzaro, made sure it was in alignment with other communities and with state law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3927.746s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I want to highlight that this is protective of the whole city because it guarantees that if the federal government decides to pick a fight over cities allowing unfettered access to health care, then we won't be fighting that battle alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3938.494s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll be going in as part of a regional and statewide cavalry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3942.513s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are in a moment where the federal government is attacking women's access to health care and trans and non-binary people's access to health care in a deliberate attempt to punish political enemies and create a distraction from this administration's catastrophic economic agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3957.92s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They're making a goal of actively making Americans' lives worse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3961.341s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm very grateful for this leadership to do what we can on the city level to say that won't happen here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3966.63s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I want to extend my gratitude to the sponsors and also to the residents who held this council to account for making this ordinance happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4962.165s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4963.106s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to thank yourself and Councilor Lazzaro for putting this together for this meeting's agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4968.151s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just think this is a moment in which it's really, really important for city leaders and leaders at all levels to be vocal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4974.557s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're in a really scary era where the federal government is using all sorts of strategies<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4980.183s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to try and actively make people more scared, more vulnerable, more unsafe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4987.106s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The goal of detentions like Ramesa's is to intimidate activists into hiding, to intimidate organizers into silence, to make non-citizens feel endangered, to make everyone afraid to speak up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4999.35s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I would hate to see the city of Medford perpetuate that because it's not going to help us withstand this very insidious culture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5007.955s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm very grateful to your leadership and putting this language forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5011.678s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7033.45s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7035.411s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do wanna take this opportunity just to read into the record some of the basic rights and resources that I think we need to be making every effort to communicate and distribute via city communication channels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7046.357s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They include, you have the right to remain silent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7049.819s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have the right to not answer questions, including questions about your immigration status.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7053.721s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have the right to call your attorney.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7055.722s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have the right to see your warrant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7057.203s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I must have a warrant signed by a judge to arrest or detain you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7061.019s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have the right to not sign any documents, even if ICE instructs you to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7065.16s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If ICE comes to your home, you have the right to not open the door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7068.321s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If ICE claims to have a warrant, you have the right to ask them to slide it under the door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7072.043s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If ICE agents do not have a warrant signed by a judge, they cannot enter a home without permission from an adult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7078.885s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If ICE comes to your business, you have the right to not answer questions about specific employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7084.007s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have the right to not introduce ICE agents to employees that they request to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7088.768s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If ICE comes to your business, you have the right to not allow them into private areas of your business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7093.05s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If ICE agents do not have a warrant signed by a judge, they cannot enter private areas of your business without your permission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7102.255s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think the least that we can do as a city, and we should go further than this, but the least we can do is make sure that all of our residents and business owners and community members unambiguously know their rights in this scary and uncertain time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7116.386s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've had a number of residents reach out to me stating, I actually don't know what a person's rights are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7122.51s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Maybe I know what I can do if ICE comes to my home or to my business, but what if they just approached me on the street, like Ramesa was approached on the street?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7131.377s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have the resources to, I mean, this information exists everywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7136.259s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There are tons of nonprofits that are doing really good work at sharing this information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7139.841s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It would be an extremely light lift for the city to put together really basic immigration, know your rights documents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7147.044s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We could work with our community liaisons team and other resources that the city already has to make sure this is translated to every language that is spoken in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7156.509s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and then use all of our official and informal communication channels in the community to try and make sure that everybody is empowered with this information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7164.799s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's not all that we should do, but we have to start there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7169.064s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9004.933s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9006.753s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I want to start by thanking everybody who's worked so hard in this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9010.554s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Genuinely, thank you so much for your hard work volunteering on behalf of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9016.369s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This has been an interesting process, and it's been characterized by hard work by many volunteers to bring this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9022.353s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The CSC's process was long and as expansive as it could be, given the resources they were allocated for a project of this size, scope, and importance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9034.28s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The council's process, I think, has been good faith, but fast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9040.127s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Back in 2024, the council requested to begin the charter review process earlier, earlier than 2025.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9047.894s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The mayor's office did not indicate that this was something they could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9052.671s">[Kit Collins]</a>: compromise on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9054.052s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um so in the past few short months, we've tried to do as thorough and thoughtful of of a review as this project deserves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9062.274s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um I don't think that that's quite a long enough time for something as important as this but we've done our best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9067.936s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Uh this is after all as we're all very well aware the city's guiding foundational legal document and I have maintained that it would be inappropriate and irresponsible<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9079.223s">[Kit Collins]</a>: for the council to consider its role as a rubber stamp on this document, no matter how eager we all are to complete this project and get it to the next phase of its journey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9094.193s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The past few months of public meetings on the charter have been, in my estimation, largely consumed by one issue, which is council makeup.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9103.135s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've had a lot of conversations about council makeup, wards or districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9106.937s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And as everybody knows, I preferred the district model.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9110.159s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Four district Councilors plus three at-large was the original proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9113.841s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then it was compromised to four district Councilors plus five at-large to allow for a bigger council, more total representatives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9122.967s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was pretty dug in, but I've been thinking about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9127.35s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that is not the hill that I'm going to die on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9131.643s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Because in my thinking about this over the past several weeks, if that central kernel is representativeness, whether the council is 5-4 or 8-3 doesn't really get at the heart of the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9145.129s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think the most important thing that we could have done or could do for meaningful representativeness, which is a spectrum, is reevaluate our strong mayor system of government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9154.734s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Because a more representative city council only goes so far when the mayor, most of the time, holds all of the cards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9162.727s">[Kit Collins]</a>: An alternative to a strong mayor system was never given terribly serious consideration in this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9170.536s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm not, I do not mean to criticize the Charter Study Committee for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9174.4s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It was a volunteer process with volunteer resources and they made incredible strides given the resources and the time that they were given.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9181.137s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But this process did not interrogate our current strong mayor system, notwithstanding what I perceive to be genuine community interest in considering other alternatives, including recent specific efforts to renegotiate the balance of power between the city council and the mayor relative to the budgeting process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9195.729s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This was brought up in our previous fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9198.752s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it shows up in lots of different ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9201.754s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Something that I really, I think it's important to surface is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9206.105s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On balance, the types of requests that I get from residents most often is essentially asking the city council to do something or fund something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9214.331s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And the answer is almost always, we can't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9217.193s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's the mayor's purview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9219.375s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All of our major functions, ordinances, zoning, budget review are constrained by the much, much greater jurisdiction of the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9227.4s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that when residents say they want representativeness, they want representative not just for talk,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9236.315s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and for exposure, but for action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9238.216s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's meaningful representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9240.558s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What I mean to say, and I'm sorry, it's taken me a bit of a walk to get here, but this is important, and I really wanna make myself clear, is that this process has clarified for me that I believe the interest of the community is for a more genuinely representative system of governance where the executive office has less power, not no power, less power, and is more meaningfully checked by the school committee and the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9264.351s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In addition to people enjoying more local representation on the school committee and on the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9270.473s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So, on top of that, the mayor's most recent draft which gave us a week to consider amendments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9276.654s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Many of those amendments further expanded mayoral power relative to the power of the Council and some of them were totally benign, but there are a number that I found very problematic and.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9286.781s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Frankly, I think that's the opposite of the direction that we should be going in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9290.544s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm not saying we should scrap this and build a strong council or city manager draft charter, though we could do that with an elected charter commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9296.928s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think that we should.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9298.309s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9298.689s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's not what I'm advancing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9301.791s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I, as one councilor, I'm going to need to see some additional amendments that at least start to move this issue of power balance in the right direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9310.437s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and start to engage with that topic of the balance of power between mayor, council, school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9315.28s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I will support the amendments to protect and preserve the city council's right to make appointments to commissions unless otherwise specified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9321.484s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I support the proposed amendment to remove the mayor's residency requirement for ward Councilors, which as the councilor stated, places a burden on ward Councilors greater than other electeds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9335.272s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would also like to make a motion to amend section 9-4B to amend the number of appointees allocated to future charter study committees by the mayor, city council, and school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9353.596s">[Kit Collins]</a>: To change that language to this review shall be made by a special committee to be composed of three appointees of the mayor,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9361.718s">[Kit Collins]</a>: three appointees of the city council, and three appointees of the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9367.042s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's changing four mayor, three city council, two school committee, to three mayor, three city council, and three school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9377.549s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I would also like to make a motion to remove the mayor from the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9380.931s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That would be amendments to section 4-1, beginning with striking the last sentence of section 4-1A.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9386.155s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These amendments<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9390.188s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In my one councilor's opinion, skip over I think the relatively smaller issue of four, three, or sorry, five to four versus eight to three, and more meaningly begin to engage with the city's balance of power.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9405.12s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Those amendments would leave me feeling comfortable supporting this draft, including eight ward councilors and three at-large councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9413.446s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And again, I want to acknowledge that there's impatience to get this done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9418.663s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I hope that in my willingness to make uncomfortable motions, people and my fellow Councilors might consider that this stems from a desire, that this stems not from an enjoyment of making uncomfortable and perhaps unpopular motions, but rather from a sincere desire to get this as right as possible because it's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9439.553s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I changed my mind on five and four and eight and three, and I've changed my mind on some other things too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9448.494s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think it's my responsibility to take the votes that I think will be best for this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9453.775s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Our next charter needs to advance the cause of improving the balance of power between the mayor and the city council and the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9458.537s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think this would move the ball forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9461.057s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If it takes a special meeting next week to discuss this and then move this forward expeditiously, staying in April, that is fine with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9470.72s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we are not the only body that has affected the timeline<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9477.921s">[Kit Collins]</a>: of this draft project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9481.004s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So those are my two motions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9482.025s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12035.149s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No, sorry, finish your thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12037.8s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Did you finish your thought?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12039.181s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12040.041s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um the motion to refer to committee of the whole was not mine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12043.243s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Uh though I do support it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12046.065s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that we should take the available committee of the whole meeting next week and then immediately meet on this again in a regular meeting or special meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12055.43s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um but the the motion to move this to a committee of the whole wasn't mine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12066.646s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12069.387s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No, I'd like to vote on it now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12479.788s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12480.508s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Super briefly, I support sending this not to a committee of the whole, but to a special meeting so that we can have one more time to discuss this and then pass it forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12490.854s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Hopefully, if it is the will of the council expeditiously with a strong vote when we talk about moving this along in the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12498.539s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes, we had a goal to approve this in mid-April to give it its best chance for success.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12503.701s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That is not the only criteria to guarantee<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12506.623s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to guarantee a higher chance of success.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12508.325s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A strong vote for the council also affects its likelihood to be taken up by the legislature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12513.389s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do not think that we will have to push this off to the spring 2026 election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12517.553s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do not want that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12518.494s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think anybody wants that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12519.655s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think that taking one more week to have another discussion about this to get this right so we can feel comfortable putting this forward with a strong vote<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12528.422s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do not think that hurts this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12530.404s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that it is incumbent upon us to give this one more discussion if that's what it needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12536.928s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that improves this project's chances of going forward successfully, which is what we all want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12543.393s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We don't just want it to go forward, we want it to go forward successfully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12546.715s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=15501.313s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm not going to restate my rationale because I think I spent at least five minutes explaining myself earlier and nobody wants to be kept here for longer than necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=15508.459s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But to any folks who weren't present for that part of the meeting, I gave like a fairly long speech explaining my rationale for why I made the motion to remove the mayor from school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=15519.107s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And if folks want to watch that back on the live stream that's already on the city's YouTube and send me their thoughts and comments and show up to the special meeting next week, I think it'd be great to continue the conversation about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=15534.555s">[Kit Collins]</a>: balance of power.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16514.449s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I only wanted to make the point that based on some of the hypotheticals that were being asked this evening, I have a concern that people are going to come out of this meeting saying this process is definitely going to happen in spring of 2026.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16528.044s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That is not an accurate thing to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16530.166s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I want us to be proactive about not spreading that speculation in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16537.434s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's because I want this to go forward successfully that I support that I'm going to support the motion to have a special meeting on this next week and I just I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16550.52s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Every community is a fertile ground for rumors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16552.761s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't want this to get out the gate and have people thinking this is definitely going to be a spring of 2026 election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16557.144s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's certainly not what I want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16558.945s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I don't think that this timeline at all locks us into that timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16563.567s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I feel very confident that we'll all be making best efforts to stick to the November 2025 timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16569.391s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I just wanted to be very clear about that because there was this question and questions about it just earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16573.853s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16574.754s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And with that, I'd like to move the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=17841.843s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=17844.998s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I remember the very first resolution that I ever sponsored after becoming Medford's first Jewish city councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=17851.68s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It was about condemning anti-Semitism because it was in the wake of an unintentional but still real and painful anti-Semitic event that occurred in Medford in December of 2021.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=17862.838s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that the councilor's intention with this resolution was simply to make Jewish residents, or at least certain Jewish residents, feel supported.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=17870.142s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But this resolution makes omissions that imply that supporting Jews is contingent on ignoring, erasing, and minimizing the genocide in Palestine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=17878.526s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And as a Jew, I find that offensive, unhelpful, and unacceptable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=17883.708s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This city council has already passed a resolution about Israel and Palestine in March of 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=17888.651s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On that one, frankly, I think we got it right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=17891.57s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Jewish, Arab, and Muslim residents and allies came together, we collaboratively crafted a statement that did not receive universal support, but earned hours of impassioned support from community members, many of whom had never been inside these council chambers before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=17905.717s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In that statement, we condemned the murder of Israelis by terrorists on October 7th and the taking of hostages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=17911.78s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We did not fail to condemn the murder of Palestinians by the IDF for every single month since then the taking of political prisoners terrorism in the West Bank by Israeli settler extremists and Israeli war crimes to name one but not the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=17927.348s">[Kit Collins]</a>: However, unintentionally sends a very strong message that messages, some pain is more real and more important than other pain to specifically mourn the 1200 Israelis murdered by Hamas on October 7 2023, but with no acknowledgement of the over 62,000 Palestinians murdered since then in Gaza by the IDF.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=17948.435s">[Kit Collins]</a>: which, according to the Lancet Medical Journal, could be undercounted by up to 40% and does not even include the over 100,000 people who have died of starvation and disease in Gaza.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=17959.566s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and does not include Palestinians murdered by extremist Israeli settler terrorism in the West Bank, that is participating in the dehumanization that allows this genocide to continue unchecked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=17971.83s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And to affirm Israel's right to exist while failing to mention Palestine's right to exist is offensive to Palestinians in our community and perpetuates a false, unhelpful right-wing ideology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=17983.433s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is incredibly radical to suggest, as this resolution does, that the Palestinians, quote, lack a permanent homeland.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=17991.54s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The city of Medford cannot be in the business of normalizing this objectively fringe and right wing opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=17998.726s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If the council is going to be bold enough to weigh in on Israel and Palestine, we should be bold enough to call things what they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=18005.223s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What's happening in Palestine is not, quote, hardship.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=18008.285s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's not difficulty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=18009.385s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's not complexity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=18010.366s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is war crimes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=18011.707s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is genocide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=18012.727s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is apartheid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=18015.138s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Supporting Jews is not contingent on erasing the genocide of Palestinians.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=18019.862s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Supporting Jews is not contingent on erasing the solidarity, pain, and outrage that so many Jews share with Palestinian victims of genocide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=18028.929s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Personally, I will never support any language that clearly does not dare to weight all human life as equal, knowing that as a Jew, I'm supposed to read this with gratitude.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=18041.727s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Further, I find it really irresponsible to force anti-Semitism and Israel and Palestine together into one topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=18048.996s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The implication is that it's anti-Semitic to criticize Israel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=18052.461s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That is false.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=18054.704s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That is a false premise that we must not entertain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=18058.501s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Right now we are in a moment where many people, including many people in our community, including many Jews like me in our community, are actively exercising their free speech to criticize Israeli genocide, Israeli war crimes, Israeli terrorism.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=18072.455s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In response, across America, conservative movements are weaponizing the language of Jewish safety and weaponizing accusations of anti-Semitism<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=18082.143s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in a coordinated effort to delegitimize criticism of Israel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=18087.044s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They see clearly that a good way to shut people up is by suggesting that they are being anti-Semitic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=18093.025s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that is why we cannot afford to entertain this false premise anywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=18098.006s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Even here at Medford City Hall, we cannot entertain this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=18101.387s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is dangerous, it is corrosive, it stifles free speech, and it silences Jews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=18106.828s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=18107.877s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I really do want to be clear, I appreciate any opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to ending anti-Semitism.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=18114.502s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Anti-Semitism is real and deadly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=18117.105s">[Kit Collins]</a>: which is why we should not allow it to be twisted into a tool for stifling pro-Palestinian activism.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=18123.889s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It does not make Jews safer when we cheapen a real phenomenon with irrelevant and politicized conflations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=18130.474s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It does not help Jews when we reaffirm right-wing messaging that ignores or legitimizes the genocide and the war crimes that occur every day with American tax dollars, when we legitimize false claims about the dangers of peace activism.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=18144.718s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It really makes me wonder how weak does a person have to think Jews are, that our safety is contingent not only on the eradication of Palestinians, but on that genocide also going unmentioned and unprotested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=18160.034s">[Kit Collins]</a>: At best, that premise treats Jews like children, and at worst, it allows us to be used like pawns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=18168.192s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If we want to pass a different resolution that aligns with the language we passed last year, that would be fine with me, but this isn't it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=18175.596s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This language takes more issue with certain forms of protest than it does with a historic genocide that is directly affecting members of our community who have family in or displaced from Palestine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=18187.522s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I have no idea why we would entertain the notion that the city of Medford should weigh in on how its residents should or should not exercise their constitutional right to protest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=18197.531s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are Councilors, not parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=18199.713s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is not our job to tell people how to use their free speech.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=18202.755s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is condescending and we should not pretend that it is anything other than irrelevant to the goal of supporting and protecting Jews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=18210.761s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also know that there are people who will agree with what I've said tonight and those who won't, that's also fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=18216.765s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's obviously a difference of opinion on this within and outside of the Jewish community and anyone who pretends otherwise is lying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=18224.46s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But that doesn't make it okay for this council to normalize, however unintentionally, right-wing messaging that uses Jewish identities as an excuse for stifling free speech and protest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=18236.005s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It doesn't make it okay for this council to conspicuously fail to stand equally strongly against anti-Palestinian hate and anti-Palestinian rhetoric as we continue to condemn the poison of antisemitism.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=18249.17s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it certainly isn't for anyone outside of the Jewish community to tell any Jews how we should feel about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=18255.378s">[Kit Collins]</a>: a motion to table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=19709.801s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=19710.662s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The statistics I was referencing was pulled from BBC and Al Jazeera, internationally respected incredible news sources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=19723.216s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Obviously, any Jew would take issue with being called anti-Semitic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=19726.82s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's not the first time I've been called anti-Semitic, but I think it's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=19739.001s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's very convenient to have a term for why it's anti-Semitic to observe and literally describe a genocide that is going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=19753.765s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It doesn't make it Holocaust inversion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=19755.545s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It doesn't make it anti-Semitic to observe and tell the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=19762.287s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I struggle to find words for how offensive it is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=19769.592s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to be told over and over again that telling the truth about this is in any way offensive to my religion and my family, who are only here in the first place because of real, not rhetorical, not invented, not fictionalized or exaggerated anti-Semitism.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1803.772s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1804.152s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was listening in on my commute here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1806.754s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry for being late to the chambers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1809.476s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On the specific amendment, I just wanted to clarify, is this replacing any text from the draft?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1838.257s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would say, in general, I want to be deferential to the sponsors of the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1843.678s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And you have been very, very closely involved in crafting a language to meet the intent of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1849.74s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I trust that intent is to be as strongly protected as possible, which is my preference as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1856.722s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I like that the original second paragraph calls out very explicitly what we're trying to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1861.464s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I hear the concerns about adhering this with other city ordinances and state law as a protective mechanism for being able to do this protective work while also making sure that if the federal government decides to pick a fight legally, we'll have allies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1875.852s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's a good idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1877.953s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I'm curious if we think there's a utility to keeping both.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1893.017s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, depending on if other councillors disagree and, you know, have a good reason, then I'm amenable to that, but I would keep both.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1907.187s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I will, if there's any, if anybody has a reaction to that, I'd hear it first, but if others agree, then I would.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=1912.688s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just don't want to step on any toes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2269.744s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2270.185s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2270.705s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't have a direct response to what you were just speaking to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2274.887s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm just I'm noticing some areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2280.029s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm noticing some discrepancies between the two versions of the ordinance that aren't noted in the markup.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2285.971s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I just want to be certain that there, I think that there might be things that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2291.114s">[Kit Collins]</a>: were changed by legal counsel in the markup version that just weren't aren't being called out using the traditional markup notation like we're not seeing the strikeout we're not seeing this was added or at least I'm not in this version of the printout and I just want to make sure we call those out and discuss them if we need to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2306.892s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For example, the definition of gender identity has been changed, maybe not substantively, but substantially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2313.694s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think we should talk about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2315.335s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I also note that these are just two that I noted off the top of my head, and I suspect there may be others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2322.957s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Under definitions, pregnancy related service has been deleted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2339.222s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think unless I'm missing something, and that's always entirely possible, I think it might be worth going through this section by section, because there's some stuff that's been changed that is not apparent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2349.928s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2595.063s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for the clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2746.423s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you for those clarifications I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2748.965s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just to be clear, the updated definitions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2752.148s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They now match the language in state law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2755.751s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2757.052s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2757.472s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2758.053s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There are ones that I would change but I guess that would require a changing state law and I see the merit of having them be in alignment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2793.955s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2800.332s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2802.173s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm just thinking, I admit I was reading over the state definition of gender identity and the part that says like provided however that this gender identity may be demonstrated through like essentially paperwork was surprising to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2816.115s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Obviously that's a statewide vulnerability if that's the language that the state has.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2824.036s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, I feel like I derailed us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2825.257s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm happy to continue going through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2828.003s">[Kit Collins]</a>: flag.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=2828.284s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's for circling back at the end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3252.944s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3253.184s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't want to cut you off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3257.928s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I think that that's one of those things that we, as a matter of practice, tend to put into ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3262.952s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it also should go without saying, and does, even though we write it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3266.235s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I don't think that it substantively changes the ordinance to leave it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3273.762s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I also don't think that we need to go out of our way to be reminding city agents to comply with federal laws that are increasingly in direct opposition to the well-being of people who live here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3288.361s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There was a different point I was gonna make, but I forgot what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3290.662s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You can make that one too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3292.303s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No, I forgot what it is, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3480.332s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, not a suggested amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3481.972s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just I just want to make sure that we talked about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3485.053s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I noticed that the legal counsel recommended that we take out the drafted section, um, which would have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3494.314s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Limited limited service and limited service pregnancy centers for like advertising their services in the city, and I know that that was because it was a potential like first amendment violation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3507.497s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3510.246s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I just didn't want that to go unnoted for the reason for it to be deleted from the draft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3517.111s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that in a lot of other communities, there's been action taken to not prevent anybody's constitutionally protected right to free speech, including to spread misinformation about abortion and pregnancy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3534.063s">[Kit Collins]</a>: it's my understanding that where our ability stops is being able to say you're not allowed to talk about your business, even if your business is fraudulent, you still have a right to be able to advertise about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3544.032s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is that, am I correct in that being the motivation for taking that section out of the ordinance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3584.71s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That makes sense, and I was happy to hear that the legal counsel flagged that as, you know, we want to pass a strong ordinance that doesn't open us up to any unnecessary liability, and this still emphasizes the city's responsibility and intent to publish consumer protection information that can help empower people to know, like, what these are should they come into the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3603.104s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We just wanted to, just wanted to clarify, just wanted to confirm that that was the intent behind that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3612.412s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That used to be...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3614.983s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In the old draft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3616.863s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In the old draft?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3621.644s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3622.144s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3622.344s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I should have said that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3628.265s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It used to be, like, I think it was G2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3630.506s">[Kit Collins]</a>: G2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3707.475s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Where is this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3710.056s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And on the City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3711.617s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3723.118s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3723.478s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3725.6s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this will be the last comment that I make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3727.982s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Overall, I just want to say thank you so much to the sponsors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3729.903s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that this is started out strong, got stronger, both in that I think the intent is still really there, really protective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3738.37s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm really proud that we're passing as strong of an ordinance as has been passed in any other Massachusetts community, maybe beyond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3747.677s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And also, I think that part of that strength is making sure that we're not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3752.961s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're not leaving anything in there that doesn't that potentially opens the city up to liability that doesn't also help us better protect residents because that is not useful to our cause.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3763.475s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do think circling back to the definition section I do think that if you know subject to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3771.032s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, a vote by the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3772.813s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would, just for the purpose of what we report out of this committee, and if it changes before we take a vote to ordain it, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3780.82s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would make a motion to delete the part of the gender identity definition that comes after the first semicolon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3795.952s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that that's in alignment with state law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3801.904s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I personally was surprised to see that language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3808.008s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The first clause also aligns with state law, and then we're just like getting a little less descriptive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3814.452s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Again, if my fellow Councilors don't agree, I won't take it personally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3816.934s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3818.014s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I understand the motivation behind having it align perfectly with state law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3822.237s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But that part that I'm...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3825.499s">[Kit Collins]</a>: suggesting that we take out would be the part that says, provided however that gender identity may be demonstrated through medical history, care or treatment of the gender identity, consistent and uniform assertion of the gender identity, or any other evidence that the gender identity is sincerely held as part of a person's core identity, and provided further<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3845.045s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that gender identity shall not be asserted for any improper purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3848.869s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And my motivation behind that is just especially in this environment, I think we're gonna see more people with gender identities other than like woman assigned female at birth and man assigned male at birth who don't have documentation that it's a core part of their identity because it's less and less safe to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3874.591s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just don't think that we need to uphold that premise in our definitions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3878.234s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If that's something that legal counsel insists we change before we take a vote to ordain this, that's fine, but I'd rather we delete it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3969.758s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, my assumption perhaps is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3978.676s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Maybe the intent in this language is that local police counts as a law enforcement agency of the Commonwealth, but I think that we should, I think we should make it really clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3995.048s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're talking about Medford, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=3996.188s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No, I think that's a good point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=4461.9s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Do you know the answer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=4462.46s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, I was just trying to sidebar you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=4465.441s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The meeting documents for this meeting, if they're not already uploaded, they'll be on the City Council's public portal website, which you can go to the City of Medford website and click on City Council and you'll find our public portal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=4477.966s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If the documents for tonight's meeting aren't up yet, I'm sure they will be by tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=4482.107s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and after this is voted on, if it is approved, it will eventually be added to the city's muni code and search city of Medford muni code.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=4493.295s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know there's a backlog on ordinances that still need to be uploaded there, but in the meantime, you can find them on the city council public portal from the date on which they were voted on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=5154.523s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanted to thank you both for your hard work over many, many months to bring this draft forward and for making sure that this got a lot of attention right now so that we can get it on, get it up for a vote as expeditiously as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=5168.788s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I've been really working very hard to make sure that this both captures the spirit of what Medford residents want this to be and also has the protections of being closely aligned with other communities ordinances and state law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=5179.872s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you for your hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=5181.793s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you to all the community members who reached out to us to hold us to account for working on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kwBGhJnWGUU&t=5186.937s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=933.153s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=933.353s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please let me know when you're ready to go and I'll call the meeting to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=946.744s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=947.125s">[Kit Collins]</a>: He did let me know that he would probably be running pretty late tonight and that he would join whenever he can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=956.572s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=956.913s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=958.622s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, there will be a meeting of the Medford City Council Planning and Permanent Committee, March 26th, 2025.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=965.666s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This meeting will take place at 6 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=967.827s">[Kit Collins]</a>: via Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=969.768s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=985.075s">[Kit Collins]</a>: present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=986.236s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For present, one absent, the meeting is called to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=990.46s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you all very much for being here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=993.443s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The action and discussion item for tonight is 24-033, zoning ordinance updates with the NS Associates team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=1002.886s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So tonight what's on our agenda is to follow up on two topics that we have discussed once before at our committee meeting two weeks ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=1012.856s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On March 12th, we reviewed a early framework for updates to Medford's accessory dwelling units or ADUs ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=1024.057s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We had a long discussion to get this update project started off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=1029.762s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The update from Innes Associates flagged updates that the City of Medford must make to our ADUs ordinance to become in compliance with the new state law that requires that ADUs be by right in any residential district that allows single family homes by right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=1047.579s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we talked about that and what that means for our zoning ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=1050.901s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And the zoning consultant and associates also flagged areas where there are more decisions left up to the city when it comes to local ADUs and options that we have for further updates we can make to further regulate or encourage ADUs beyond just the new regulations that are required by state law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=1069.871s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so we'll be looking at an updated draft<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=1072.432s">[Kit Collins]</a>: of the ADU's ordinance tonight in response to the questions and feedback that councillors and committee community members had two weeks ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=1081.885s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We will also tonight be visiting the topic of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=1087.633s">[Kit Collins]</a>: updated zoning for Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=1089.795s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This will be our very first time looking at a proposal of an updated zoning map for Medford Square and it will not be the last time we talk about it either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=1097.441s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Two weeks ago, we looked at a really preliminary introductory, a 30,000 foot view of a zoning map that encapsulates a commercial framework or a zoning map encapsulating a commercial framework for the city touching on all major squares.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=1114.376s">[Kit Collins]</a>: corridors, mixed-use, and commercial districts, and we decided that from there we're kind of going to draw the telescope in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=1121.382s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're going to go from that bird's-eye view commercial framework and focus the dial on Medford Square, and then West Medford Square, and then other major corridors and mixed-use and commercial districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=1133.754s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So the first one up is Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=1135.256s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that the Innes Associates has presented, has prepared<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=1139.279s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, some maps and some diagrams for us to look at and respond to tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=1144.401s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we'll be able to get a lot of questions and ideas and concerns on the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=1148.383s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that will be followed up by, um, further conversations on this topic in this committee, um, over the next several weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=1156.906s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I know that Paola has a presentation, um, on all of this before I throw it over to Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=1162.568s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, I want to ask if any of my fellow Councilors have any questions or comments to start off the evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=1169.762s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=1170.102s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing none, plenty of time for that later on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=1171.603s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Paola, please go ahead with your presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=1968.723s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=1969.523s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I think that I've previewed the section studies that you're going to present next, and I think folks will find them very interesting context.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=1978.685s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But let's take a pause here in case there are any preliminary<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=1982.34s">[Kit Collins]</a>: questions or comments on this aerial view.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=1985.081s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Leming will go to you first, unless you wanna hold your question for later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2094.481s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, thank you for putting that suggestion in that question on the record, Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2099.933s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't know if Paula has a response to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2103.159s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm certainly always helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2107.07s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think these are exactly the areas where we should be evaluating for where our subdistricts of greatest height and density makes most sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2113.979s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I've thought before that I'd really love to see some increased height along 93 so we can kind of kill two birds with one stone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2125.213s">[Kit Collins]</a>: adding some development potential while blocking some noise from 93 for the residential and business areas that are closer to the square or bordering the highway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2133.959s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On the matter of the traffic patterns, I think most folks on this call, whether they're Councilors or community members, already know that through zoning, we cannot and we won't directly change traffic patterns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2147.007s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that you know that, Councilor Leming, I'm just stating that for the record for in case there's any newer to zoning folks on the call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2153.592s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Not that that's what you're suggesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2157.655s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think is the the question is kind of like forecasting ahead for feel free to clarify.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2229.41s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2230.871s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll go to Planner Evans and then Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2234.635s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do just want to note kind of at the beginning of this discussion, or kind of whenever we're talking about like traffic patterns and zoning changes at the same time, I think it's wise to enter into that discussion, not assuming that development<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2249.668s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that increases in development will always necessarily at every step of the way also result in increases in car traffic, especially since we're considering policies such as TDM, transportation demand management, at the same time as zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2264.58s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This can interact with traffic patterns in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2268.043s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In many ways, it's not a 1 to 1 relationship, so I think this is going to be 1 of those incredibly multifactorial things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2275.45s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would think that the short answer would be zoning would not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2281.997s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Directly overlay onto our ability to update our future traffic patterns because.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2288.151s">[Kit Collins]</a>: eminent domain taking of public lands that are used for our roadways, and a lot of our roadways leading into Medford Square are state roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2294.694s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're going to have the same land mass available for traffic lanes that we could design however we wish if we had the millions of dollars required to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2305.019s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I will go over to Planner Evans for a response and then Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2463.427s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for that planner Evans, Councilor Kelly and go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2635.153s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go ahead, Councilwoman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2920.141s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is there any further questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2921.101s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's a great catch, Councilor Callaghan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2922.802s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2923.422s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And thank you for running over those initial suggestions, Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2927.543s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It sounds like there is interest in, you know, I think the point of these early discussions is to put these kind of ideas and suggestions out on the record, and then the consultant can follow up, look more deeply at the areas where we want to investigate a little bit further and get back to us with an answer on, you know, for example,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2944.127s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is it feasible to consider a higher and more dense sub district for specific parcel it sounds like there's an interest in that being further investigated for a further meeting if it does turn out that it's confirmed that the lots<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2959.828s">[Kit Collins]</a>: directly abutting 93 to the east of City Hall are really too narrow to accommodate mixed use three, then that'll be good information to have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2969.732s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Maybe the same is not quite true for that large kind of triangle-shaped parcel, but I think that that's a great thing for us to take out of this meeting as a point for future research.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2979.856s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you for speaking to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2982.117s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Paola, I'll put that on my notes as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2986.382s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is great to hear that potential traffic and roadway changes are being considered at the same time as respondents to the Medford Square RFP are being considered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2995.966s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Because if improvements can be made faster than perhaps I pessimistically hoped, then I suspect that everybody would be happy about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=3006.487s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Gosh, the Medford Square traffic really needs to be made slower and safer and better for actually enjoying the square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=3014.529s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we have a lot of other views of this, and I'll go to Director Hahn first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=3073.262s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=3073.702s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=3074.742s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's great to know, and we'll be sure to find that link so councillors can further promote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=3080.824s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's a big deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=3082.965s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Changing the signaling would be a really big deal for traffic in and out of the square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=3087.246s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I know we have many other diagrams that Paola has prepared for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=3089.927s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to make sure that we have time to look at them, respond to them, and also talk about the updates to the ADU ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=3096.588s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So let's proceed through the presentation, Paola, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=3940.914s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=3941.775s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=3942.816s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is certainly a lot to digest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=3945.678s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a great jumping off point for our discussion of Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=3950.562s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know this will feed into our discussion of West Medford Square as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=3955.906s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we've had the chance to look at a bunch of these kind of snapshot section views from around the square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=3963.872s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that this could be a great opportunity to get Councilors and city staff's initial impressions and questions and more suggestions like we had just earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=3973.357s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then of course, as Councilors and community members have additional feedback we can be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=3979.64s">[Kit Collins]</a>: taking that in between these meetings as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=3982.601s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I thank you for that last note that you made, Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=3985.402s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's always helpful to keep re-emphasizing what we mean when we look at these maps and when we talk about zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=3991.905s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think the way that you put it was really well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=3994.046s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When we look at the zoning map, this is not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=3996.907s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, one, this is a proposal, this is a draft, I'm sure this will change before it is something that we vote on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4002.05s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But also, this is not a map of what the square will absolutely look like, even if this zoning were to be adopted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4009.754s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a map of one version of what could be made possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4015.418s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So even when we say, you know, this could go up to eight, this could go up to 12, this could go up to six, that's depending on if developers are trying to develop just within what's by right, or if they're taking advantage of incentive zoning,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4026.952s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to a certain degree, to maximum, to minimum, not that under this new zoning, every building shall be a certain height, setting a minimum and a maximum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4038.641s">[Kit Collins]</a>: With that, I'll go to comments and questions from councillors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4040.743s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Callahan, please go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4041.884s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4153.053s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4153.373s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I see a couple hands.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4155.075s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4155.495s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I totally forgot to say this at the end of the meeting or sorry at the beginning of the meeting will take all public participation on this topic after Councilors conclude their comments, then we'll move on to 80 years and we'll take all public participation on 80 years at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4167.367s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So please hang tight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4169.409s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We will get to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4171.17s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4172.391s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing no other Councilors hands raised right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4177.295s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just want to put a couple of my own comments on the records on the for some of these specific sections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4186.502s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That we looked at in general.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4189.144s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that this framework is about right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4192.207s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sure that we will massage some of where some of the sub districts start and end as we continue to iterate on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4199.292s">[Kit Collins]</a>: including some of the suggestions that have already been made tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4205.117s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanted to note, I find it particularly exciting what the consultants are bringing forward around how we can use these like topography changes and the slope of the earth below our buildings to our advantage when it comes to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4224.011s">[Kit Collins]</a>: creating more potential for development and also hiding parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4227.774s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Like for example, yeah Paola knew exactly what I was talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4231.237s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These places where we can use the slope of the land to our advantage to add height in a way that does not feel like you're adding height in bulk from for in this example High Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4242.766s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4244.307s">[Kit Collins]</a>: have two more additional floors and it doesn't feel like two more additional floors from the pedestrian's perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4249.371s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4251.273s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that especially when we're considering like the south side of High Street to Mystic Valley Parkway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4255.776s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know for myself I'm so used to seeing those parking lots kind of right along the parkway in front of the river that it's hard for me to even to imagine those being destinations instead of just parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4270.208s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I'm particularly enamored by version two<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4273.516s">[Kit Collins]</a>: for the south side of High Street and for Mystic Valley Parkway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4277.38s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We know that we need parking to, you know, parking has a big role in the square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4281.625s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is where a lot of our city's major destinations are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4285.549s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We need people to be able to drive and park there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4288.192s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we also really do want to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4290.468s">[Kit Collins]</a>: using more of our, I think we want to be using more of our land area for giving people places to live and stuff to do and companies and offices to visit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4298.075s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I will be, I just wanted to throw my support behind version two for this particular section and then for the south side of High Street as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4305.761s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's a really smart way to be using our topography.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4313.186s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And in general, I know this is brought up for Clippership Drive as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4316.187s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think in general, hiding parking is a great idea because it allows us to keep our building frontages exciting and full of places that people can walk into.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4325.61s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The only kind of question that I think I'll have going forward is, and I'm not sure if this is really an answerable question or if this is something that will vary development by development,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4333.473s">[Kit Collins]</a>: is when we're talking about putting parking inside of a building, how does that impact the actual usable, rentable, inhabitable space within that floor map or within that parcel?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4348.416s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Though as I think more about it, it seems that that's probably more of a economic consideration on the developer side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4354.478s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I just want to make sure that we're not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4358.299s">[Kit Collins]</a>: trading, useful commercial and residential space for parking, whether it's inside or outside of a building envelope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4368.283s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Having put that on the record, are there any other additional comments, suggestions, references from Councilors on the maps that we have looked at so far tonight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4378.808s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Things that we want our consultants to be keeping in mind as these are being revised for our next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4388.941s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing none, we've got a couple great ideas on the record already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4392.644s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And of course, councillors can always contact the zoning consultant with ideas, either via me as committee chair, Director Hunt in between meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4405.935s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, seeing no further comment from councillors, I will go to public participation on this item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4411.678s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I will call on you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4412.699s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go ahead, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4484.815s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you for the question, Councilor Gallahan, and thank you for the answer, Director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4489.298s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, I'll go to public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4491.079s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll ask you to unmute on Zoom, give your name and address for the record, and then each participant will have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4499.024s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Dave, go ahead, name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4763.605s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4764.466s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Dave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4766.166s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll go next to Gaston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4768.767s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=4770.688s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5044.52s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for your comments, Gaston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5047.382s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well heard and well taken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5048.383s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that we will absolutely be continuing to consider traffic parking and increasing density in tandem as we go forward this spring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5057.189s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you for your comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5059.65s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll go next to Navar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5062.512s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5063.853s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And you have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5228.432s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you very much, William.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5231.877s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, I see no more hands raised from, oh, Councilor Callahan, please go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5320.05s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5321.01s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's, um, it's a really interesting prompt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5323.591s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's one that, um, well, I just say that I think the concept of how do we, how do we get the type of stuff in the square that we feel like the community is really clamoring for is a question that is kind of frequently on people's minds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5337.214s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My understanding, and I'll pass it over to city staff or economic development director after this, but I think that how, as folks know, um, how uses interplay with zoning is that we have this ability to say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5350.577s">[Kit Collins]</a>: clearly defined uses that are allowed by right, that are allowed under certain circumstances, and that are never allowed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5356.759s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it's my understanding that it is both tricky and we also get into heavily constrained legal waters when we start saying, we start cherry picking, picking and choosing, and that would require<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5371.235s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, perhaps I think there's always a long list of things in a commercial district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5376.798s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's a lot of different types of companies and offices that are going to be available by right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5379.98s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's often a smaller list of those that are more regulated by special permit or explicitly not allowed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5385.983s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think it gets very complicated when we try to use zoning to get more specific about that, which is why I think this overlaps so heavily with the work of the economic development director and city planning staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5398.709s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I will go to Director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5401.38s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and then our Director of Economic Development for more on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5507.677s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes, go ahead, sell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5508.597s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Then we'll go to you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5752.248s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for the question, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5755.91s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And thank you, Sal, for the very informative response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=5759.592s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli, please go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6121.201s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Of course, Councilor, thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6122.542s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate you putting that all out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6124.744s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think your points are really well taken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6126.285s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I hear you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6128.827s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that Medford Square is probably our best example of all of the areas that we're going to look at in the comprehensive rezoning of like just all of these themes interacting with each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6140.237s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think people really feel that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6142.539s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6144.871s">[Kit Collins]</a>: know this is our chance to use the structure of the zoning overhaul to continue to try to use this as a container for bringing together residents and butters and members of our business community and the great minds inside city hall together with our zoning consultant to look down at the plans that we already have the people already waited on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6166.748s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And continue widening that net and making sure that with every meeting, with all the meetings that we're going to have in this committee on this proposal, and then in the Q and A that we'll have on the squares, and then with the public hearings that the CDB will have, totally every step of the way, we have to be widening that net and making sure that more voices are included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6184.729s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I also think that it's,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6187.597s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These, these committee meetings in a way to me are kind of like a think of it as like a tip of the iceberg where so many things get concepts get mentioned and plans that have like hours and hours of work and collaboration behind them and these meetings can sometimes feel like a really brief snapshot of all this work that's gone on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6208.93s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to become the plans and the themes that just get mentioned in passing here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6213.513s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that, I hope that when residents interact with that, they can see that and take it as an on-ramp for continuing to attend these meetings and learn more about the things that get mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6223.459s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6224.6s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6226.001s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6227.102s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I saw your hand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6229.483s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Do you want to comment or do you want to wait until we have one more bit of public participation on this topic?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6235.487s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then we can, if you want to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6240.751s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6241.912s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6242.212s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then we will get to our second topic of the evening, which is ADUs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6245.015s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I hope we've all been pacing ourselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6246.916s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just kidding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6249.619s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I see one more hand raised for public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6251.921s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Cheryl, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6252.642s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6253.903s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6328.609s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for coming, Cheryl.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6330.79s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do just want to state for clarity for any folks who are watching, the ramp issue, I'm glad folks are talking about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6336.751s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's not something that we could do through zoning, so I just want to make that clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6339.592s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think the speaker, I know that's not something that they were putting forward, but I just want to state that for clarity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6345.334s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's not a change that we'll be making through this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6350.074s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing no public participation, thank you all so much for weighing in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6354.257s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And this is, I just want to state again, I'll state at the beginning, I'll state at the end, this is our first draft of the zoning proposal for Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6361.523s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This will be an iterative process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6362.924s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We will see this again in this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6365.926s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And if community members have additional feedback or ideas that they want to share in between or outside of committee meetings,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6373.852s">[Kit Collins]</a>: they can email those to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6375.093s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I will get them circulated to our zoning consultant and our planning staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6380.395s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So Paola, please feel free to respond and then we can go ahead to our overview of the latest updates to the ADU's ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6387.137s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6517.304s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6517.75s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for the clarification, Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6521.093s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let's proceed along to the overview of the latest updates to the ADU's ordinance, unless there's anything more on this, but I think we have a lot to respond to for the next draft of this proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6546.025s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And while you're getting set up, Paola, I'll just state I wanted to give you a brief vocal rest since you've been presenting a lot tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6553.951s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And while you're getting the PowerPoint up, I said this at the beginning of the meeting, but for anybody who's joined after our initial five minutes, at our previous committee meeting on the 12th, we got an overview of potential changes to make to our existing accessory dwelling unit ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6572.083s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We already have a regulation around ADUs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6574.625s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are considering kind of two buckets of updates and changes to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6578.408s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One are changes that the city is compelled to make because the state passed a new law and it is now required that wherever single family homes are allowable by right, ADUs must also be allowable by right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6591.098s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we have to make some changes to the ordinance to be in compliance with that state law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6595.762s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And beyond that, there are additional decisions that we could make per our local jurisdiction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6600.726s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We kind of got a initial conversation on all of those areas and questions two weeks ago, and councilors and community members got some ideas and thoughts out on the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6610.934s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think we're going to revisit some of those questions tonight and kind of develop a path forward on some of those on some of the questions before us in terms of local ideas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6624.909s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=6625.229s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7265.211s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Paola, for that overview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7270.014s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's really helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7270.834s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate the way that you organized it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7273.416s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I see a hand on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7275.497s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7276.057s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We will take public participation on ADUs after questions and comments from Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7281.2s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So sit tight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7281.701s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We will definitely get to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7285.937s">[Kit Collins]</a>: begin with my own clarifying questions and then see if there are others from other Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7292.159s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'll just repeat some of this to make sure that I am understanding the presentation correctly and hopefully for the benefit of other viewers as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7300.422s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So kind of going down the line of these various questions before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7305.97s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to the first question around local ADUs, municipal jurisdiction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7309.392s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It seems like per our, it seems like you adopted the preference that it seemed like it was voiced for most Councilors at our last committee meeting, that we do want to allow local ADUs in more residential sub-districts beyond just those where single family homes are allowed by right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7328.225s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So is this understanding correct that in this draft, yes, local ADUs are allowed in all sub-districts,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7336.55s">[Kit Collins]</a>: by right, but they're not allowed by right on lots that have for those larger residential building types, such as townhouses, multiplexes, multifamily units, sorry, multifamily buildings greater than six units.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7352.556s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On your single family homes, your two families, your three units, those can have a local ADU by right, regardless of the residential subdistrict.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7360.72s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is that, do I have that right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7363.894s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7364.535s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for verifying my rambling paraphrasing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7370.801s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just to return quickly to the municipal jurisdiction, municipal decision topic of can we have a second ADU on a single lot by special permit, I just want to make sure that I'm clear on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7385.585s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So the conditions that trigger a special permit process, it's not that every local ADU must be approved by special permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7393.747s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's that if a second ADU<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7398.208s">[Kit Collins]</a>: on a single lot has to go through the special permit process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7401.73s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And through that special permit process, they may go as high as 1,200 square feet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7408.594s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7421.777s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7422.137s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Personally, I am fine with having the maximum area be up to 1,200.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7430.223s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In this case, where it is moderated by a special permit process, I don't think that I would want any local ADU to be able to go quite that high.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7437.068s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that 900 is reasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7438.969s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But since this is kind of bordered by the special permit process, I'm kind of OK with it because it has that level of supervision over it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7449.376s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then the last comment that I wanted to put out before my fellow councillors, like I was saying, I think that the 900 square foot number seems about right to me for local ADUs in general in this non-special permit scenario.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7468.02s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I understand the concern about, you know, if we're going above 50% of the gross floor area, then like which unit is inferior to which, I can understand that could get a little murky.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7480.103s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do think that in cases when you have an attached or internal ADU that it could, there might be a situation there would be helpful to be able to go above that maximum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7489.187s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So pending what legal counsel, what Attorney Silverstein has to say about this, I think it might be helpful in cases of an internal or attached ADU to be able to go up to 60% just in cases where like that is what makes sense for how the building is structured internally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7507.254s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So if we keep that flexible pending,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7510.283s">[Kit Collins]</a>: a comment from Attorney Silverstein, that would make sense to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7515.467s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And all of the other changes from my perspective as one Councilor sound good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7519.59s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was not particularly in favor of us growing our base of ADUs just for them to be used as short-term rentals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7525.935s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We want them to be used as housing for people who need housing of the scope and the scale.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7531.139s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that looks great to me as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7536.573s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are there any questions or comments from my fellow Councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7554.062s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Being none, I'm just going to pause for a second to deal with a Zoom issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7558.384s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One second, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7578.394s">[Kit Collins]</a>: CoB, Christina McLean she-her-hers<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7597.46s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, seeing none, we'll go to public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7599.761s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I will ask you to unmute, please state, or you know what, actually, I need the, sorry, the Zoom issues we're having is that the clerk's computer keeps throwing him off the Zoom and I realized I actually really need him fully capacitated for the public participation part so he can write down people's names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7618.749s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry for the interruption, folks, just give me a couple of minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7628.435s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mr. Quirk, do you have co-hosting abilities again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7646.448s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On my end, it shows you as the host, but clearly is going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7657.123s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I will do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7662.045s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7662.385s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7662.966s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thanks so much for your flexibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7667.688s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7669.789s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Going back to public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7671.45s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, all right, Daniel, we'll go to you first name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7675.732s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And you have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7878.669s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great comments, Daniel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7879.83s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's a really important thing for us to note and investigate either in this meeting or something to think about for the next draft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7889.875s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Paola, I see your hand is up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7890.975s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Do you want to respond directly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7987.987s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Paula.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7988.547s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7989.368s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So it's in considering the dimensional standards governing what's possible for the ADUs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=7996.954s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is about conformity with the building code, but when we're considering the interplay of the code regulations on the principal dwelling and then on the ADU, it's always the more permissive of those regulations that can be used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8009.864s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that this is something for us to take a closer look at before we get the final version.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8015.188s">[Kit Collins]</a>: of these updates to make sure that we're taking a fine tooth comb to how this plays out in each of our districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8022.657s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that we're all aligned with the perspective that was shared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8028.123s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're doing this update because we want more ADUs to be built.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8030.946s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's the reason that we're expanding them into all residential sub-districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8033.307s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's the reason we're going further than the state mandates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8036.668s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so we do want to be turning over other stone when it comes to making sure that the new language makes it easy for people to take us up on these regulations and add ADUs beneficially in a way that's good for property owners and also good for the community overall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8055.561s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'll be making a note of those, talk about that more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8060.344s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Next up, we'll go to Mark.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8062.705s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8064.807s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And you have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8073.692s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mark just asked you to unmute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8075.734s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll click again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8076.534s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You're gonna have to click a button to unmute yourself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8086.304s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Try one more time, and then I'll go to somebody else and try to come back to you later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8089.507s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, we will come back to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8095.231s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Next, I will go to Gaston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8098.594s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8099.675s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8134.732s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes, Don, if you want, if you have multiple questions, feel free to state them all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8254.305s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for your questions, Gaston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8255.529s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So if I understand it right, I think you're asking, is it redundant to list?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8261.675s">[Kit Collins]</a>: NR 1, 2, and 3 under local ADUs, because per the state law, ADUs in those sub-districts are protected ADUs, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8280.607s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes, I believe that's correct, but I'll go to Paola to run down your three questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8431.273s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for noting that, Gaston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8432.834s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll definitely take a note about that and look into it further.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8437.456s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8438.217s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll go to Dave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8440.458s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8442.399s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8590.589s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8594.49s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Dave really appreciate those comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8596.111s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And, um, in hearing you reflect on that section, it occurs to me that my paraphrasing earlier might have actually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8603.27s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Miss characterized or misunderstood part of what was stated there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8607.291s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Paola, could you speak to that point briefly please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8610.152s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is it, I think that Dave's read might actually be correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8613.272s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is it that the ADU may be a short-term rental if the principal dwelling is owner occupied?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8620.914s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Or is it just in any case, the minimum rental period is 30 days?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8669.72s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8670.341s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8671.042s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, make sure it makes sense to me to run that by our attorney on the zoning project and just make sure that that's correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8679.455s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As I stated earlier, my preference would also be to have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8685.238s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to not be in any way encouraging or incentivizing the use of ADUs as short-term rentals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8693.181s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have a lot of out-of-compliance short-term rentals in the community already, and I think the best use of these would be to add housing and a version of housing that we don't have a lot of in the community already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8706.026s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So it'd be great to confirm that, and thank you for bringing it up, Dave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8711.203s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go next to Martha, name and address for the record please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8714.787s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8796.108s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8796.308s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Martha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8797.629s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Really appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8800.492s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mark, I'll go to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8801.953s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8804.315s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8808.916s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm going to click the ask to unmute button that should, the button to unmute should pop up on your end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8832.659s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8832.899s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm not sure why this isn't working.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8834.22s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8836.121s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We can't seem to get your audio.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8840.364s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If you're not able to unmute before we adjourn this meeting, please feel free to email me your comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8846.128s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll make sure that we get you a response from myself, the zoning consultant, or city planning staff expeditiously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8851.412s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll try again before we give up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8855.114s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll go next to Kirsten.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8857.156s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8858.336s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8936.726s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, thank you so much for your question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8938.387s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate you trying to move that project forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8942.51s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that this conversation is probably a bit broader scope than will be useful for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8948.174s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're talking about kind of, as I'm sure you know and have gathered, this is a bit of a higher level conversation and those particularities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8955.62s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that our building commissioner and our city planning staff<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8958.582s">[Kit Collins]</a>: would probably be very capable of giving you some useful instructions and next steps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8968.767s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If you do not have their contact information already, it's easily findable on the city website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8973.369s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It sounds like you might be in touch with a couple of those city staff members already, but I think that'll be a better source of information for you than this kind of higher level discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8984.22s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If you do need any contact info for city staff, please do feel free to reach out to me if you're not able to get in touch with the relevant parties and I will connect you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8995.247s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go next to Tara.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=8998.008s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll ask you to unmute and you'll have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9000.95s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9092.689s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for your questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9093.93s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Paolo or city planning staff, is there any initial reactions to that question around, is there guidance in the scenario of two ADUs on one lot, is there guidance around, is it possible to do stacking like Tara described, and how would height permissions apply in this case where both of the ADUs are attached to the principal structure, if that's allowable?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9122.928s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's also something that we can circle back to if it requires further research.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9130.654s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I see Planner Evans has her hand up, or Paola, we can go to you first, if you have a reaction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9142.364s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9142.564s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Danielle, please go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9222.791s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, I definitely heard clearly that the, um, kind of the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9229.113s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the height allowed for the principal structure would apply in this case, because we go by what's most permissible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9235.716s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm not hearing that there's, I would be surprised if there was guidance already on the stacking of two ADUs, both attached to a principal structure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9243.28s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Do you know, Danielle, if there happens to be like design.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9264.727s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It seems like this might be a case where there is maybe not the most readily available precedent or guidance currently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9276.65s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think this might, unless there's further guidance from Paola on this, this might be another great candidate for following up with the city's building commissioner directly, who might be able to give you more guidance that's specific to your situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9291.957s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Paola, anything that you want to add on this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9302.755s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9303.656s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9303.956s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And thank you for the question, Tara.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9306.477s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9307.678s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If there's anybody who wants to attempt to speak in public participation again, or anybody who wants to speak a second time, please raise your hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9317.797s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Otherwise, I think that we have, I think this has been an especially productive round of public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9322.499s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've been taking a lot of notes on some very specific feedback that we have from community members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9329.621s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's all certainly well heard and well taken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9331.222s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll be looking deeper into all of these as we dig deeper into dimensional requirements for the ADUs and looking at how they interact with principal structures in the various districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9343.607s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, Mark, let's give it another go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9344.947s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm asking you to unmute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9355.307s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm asking you to unmute once more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9357.208s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9370.673s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It seems like your Zoom does not want you to speak today, but rest assured that we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9374.134s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I apologize that you can't seem to come off mute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9379.537s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll go to Marie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9381.822s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9383.323s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9408.993s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9409.773s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Pamela or Danielle, do you happen to know offhand, is there a minimum square footage or might it be just dependent on if there's the minimum allowable setbacks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9419.816s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sorry, Director Hunt, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9462.107s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9467.277s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9467.597s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Paola, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9489.675s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for that clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9496.44s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9496.64s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well, this has been a very substantive conversation across two topics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9502.924s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you all very much, community members, city staff, councillors alike, for your feedback on the updates to the ADU's ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9510.268s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that there's a lot for us to take back and incorporate into our next draft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9515.531s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Ditto for the draft in progress of the Medford Square zoning that we discussed earlier in the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9523.157s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, it's getting late, so I will entertain any further comments, questions or motions to adjourn from my fellow Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9537.348s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9543.753s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On the motion to adjourn by Councilor Leming, seconded by Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9548.457s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mr. Clerk, whenever you're ready.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9556.856s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to thank Paola for the very thorough presentation and discussion tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9561.819s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, as always, for walking us through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9564.1s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, city staff, for being here to offer your insight on our discussions, and thank you to all community members for being a part of our ongoing zoning discussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9589.914s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9590.639s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Three in favor, two absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=9592.411s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The motion passes and the meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=1269.368s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you president bears some of these topics have been discussed before this council before I've been going back and forth with the chief of staff and our parking director to try to find a date for the entire council to meet in committee of the whole about these topics with our parking director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=1285.895s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We landed on this date for the topic specifically the ordinance change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=1290.337s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that hadn't been brought up and assigned a paper number before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=1292.298s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I wanted to make sure that councilors had advanced notice about the matter and that we could all gather in committee of the whole to begin the discussion about the parking department's use of technology, as well as a general update about the GLX program and other parking-related updates before our next regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=1313.908s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=1315.188s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any motion for approval?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=1373.302s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=1541.008s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, president bears at this meeting, we reviewed a draft framework for updating the city is accessory dwelling units ordinance and we took a very first look at a zoning proposal for Medford square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=1555.831s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Both of these topics will be met about again, including at the planning and permitting committee tomorrow night at 6 PM on zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=1564.653s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3793.497s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you president bears for reading out the full text of the resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3797.28s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm glad to have collaborated with members of 509 on this resolution and I thank them for bringing their fight for a fair contract to our attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3811.271s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was talking about this resolution with some community members before the meeting and over the weekend and they said, you know, why is this a Medford issue?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3818.219s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And to that I say, you know, Tufts is a huge employer in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3823.565s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So many members of our community are involved with Tufts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3826.948s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In various ways, perhaps they work at Tufts or teach at Tufts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3830.032s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Tufts is a major employer in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3832.014s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It has a major footprint in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3833.837s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And when it comes to fair employment, fair wages, and the right to collectively bargain, this is a rising tide lifts all boats issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3842.307s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And with a large, ostensibly non-for-profit that is such an outsized presence and an outsized footprint in our community, I think it's the least that we can do to say we must participate in holding you accountable to treating all workers with fairness, and at the very least, participating in good faith with efforts to collectively bargain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3865.174s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Our relationship with Tufts University and the city of Medford overlaps in many ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3871.015s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've spoken at length in these chambers about the payment in lieu of tax agreement that the city of Medford has with Tufts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3879.599s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What we are talking about is a very large, extremely well-endowed, very powerful institution that absolutely has the resources to pay its workers commensurate with their value, to pay them competitively, and to pay them so that they can comfortably live in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3900.088s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so I hope that my fellow councillors will join me tonight in urging them to do just that and to engage in a good faith negotiation process with these essential Tufts University workers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3913.433s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But more importantly, I understand that there are a couple members of the bargaining unit that are attending the city council meeting tonight, and I'm sure that they can speak to their efforts much more eloquently than I could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=3924.498s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4895.505s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for the bears 1st, I apologize if my audio isn't coming through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4899.83s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well, my Internet is unstable right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4901.612s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I. I hear the counts are appreciate him bringing that up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4911.263s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Preference would be to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4917.938s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Vote on that as a B paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4919.799s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would certainly be in favor since these workers requested that the most persuasive to this employer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4931.402s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'd like to honor sentiment for our bargaining units here in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5292.065s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, president bears for the overview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5294.247s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was going to just summarize much in the same way that you did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5297.79s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I thank my colleagues and city planning staff for their collaboration on this draft proposal over 4 meetings in January and February in committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5307.499s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I was also going to take the opportunity like you did to promote the public Q and a session that will be this Thursday at 6 PM in the city council chambers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5317.709s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This will be in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5318.669s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There will be big graphs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5319.75s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's a great opportunity for people to learn more and ask questions and state their ideas and concerns about the proposal before the Community Development Board public hearings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5330.857s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also heard from Director Hunt just earlier today that this Q&A will no longer be only in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5336.741s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There will also be a Zoom option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5339.803s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just encourage people to take advantage of that opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=5344.085s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And with that, I motion for referral to the CDB.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1737.092s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1738.213s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is my audio coming through okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1751.898s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1752.399s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1754.0s">[Kit Collins]</a>: How's that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1754.361s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1754.821s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thanks so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1755.282s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well, thank you so much to my fellow councillors for your comments so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1761.948s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's exciting to be at the beginning of another budget process again with you all, and I'm grateful for all of everybody submitted, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1770.777s">[Kit Collins]</a>: very additive and thoughtful preliminary budget recommendations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1775.201s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is, you know, the work ahead of us is funneling down the request from the Council into a tight, succinct list that we can hope to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1785.768s">[Kit Collins]</a>: fit into the overall operating budget of things that we think are the most critical and most needed by the community this year, and I think that we're off to a strong start because I see a lot of overlap between a lot of different Councilors, based on the comments and feedback that we've all been hearing from residents over the past year and longer than that so I'll quickly summarize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1805.236s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The priorities that I submitted ahead of this meeting, and I'll skip the entire preamble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1810.48s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This goes without saying, but I think it is worth saying out loud that we cannot permit any reduction from the school committee's budgetary request for Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1824.05s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It would be very important to me that we prioritize meeting that this year, as we always prioritize meeting that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1830.119s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Similarly, prioritizing meeting the library department budgetary request and maintaining at least level service and hours of operation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1838.932s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In parallel with what some other Councilors have mentioned about prioritizing the funding recommendations, the funding asks from the Medford Bicycle Advisory Committee, I'd like to see us fund one additional traffic engineer for a total of two within the Department of Traffic and Transportation to focus on walking, biking, transit, and the implementation of a vision zero and complete streets policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1863.817s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I won't get too into the details here, obviously, that there's a lot of ground that such a position could cover.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1869.818s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But other councillors have said a lot in this meeting about things, kind of things we can fund where we'd see a very big return on impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1878.72s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think this is one of them, because these are the people who, if we're able to get them inside of City Hall, could help us out not just with responding to constituent concerns and doing things with the resources that we already have,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1889.602s">[Kit Collins]</a>: but also applying for state and federal grants that would help us do the transformative road design and pedestrian and bicycle safety projects that we already know that we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1900.727s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I will also mention funding a therapeutic recreation and inclusion specialist and an office manager for metric recreation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1909.011s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We heard a lot from the families of youth with disabilities about where these two positions would fit into the puzzle when it comes to making<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1918.315s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Medford recreation and just not even recreation, but participation citywide, more accessible for people with and without disabilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1926.361s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think it's incredibly important that this year we start putting things into the budget that will move us closer towards a fully accessible future for Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1937.328s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also recommend that we increase the budgeted amount for our city solicitor salary so that we can, God willing, this year fill that position, which I know we are all very, very keen to see that filled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1950.916s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My estimate was that infusing $36,000 into that line item would bring this into competitiveness with our neighboring municipalities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1959.761s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm not sure if we've received yet the classification and compensation study that could give us further guidance on what that should be raised to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1967.886s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And lastly, I'll just mention similar to in previous years, I'd like to see us maintain all grant funded personnel in the health department, the Office of Outreach and Prevention, the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1980.793s">[Kit Collins]</a>: aligned with what I said about Medford's Bicycle Advisory Committee's funding recommendations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=1986.415s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'd like to see us increase our capital spending earmark for expanding our network of separated protected bike lanes, completing the bike master plan, and doing design studies for Vision Zero and Complete Streets policies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=2002.885s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And this one, I think, is small dollars compared to things like salaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=2006.387s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think we should also be putting more money into installing and maintaining road safety equipment interventions, everything from bike racks and flex posts to increased signage, as well as planning new crosswalks where we already know that we need them, such as on Salem Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=2027.817s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Pardon me, just finding my notes that I toggled away from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=2035.216s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also wanted to co-sign recommendations that I've heard so far from a couple other councillors that I haven't mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=2042.998s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm really glad that Councilor Lazzaro brought up the dive team training for the Medford Fire Department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=2050.02s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It seems to me that a lot of recommendations from many councillors have all been circling around safety improvements that will have such a vast qualitative impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=2061.345s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Improvement for the people of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=2063.446s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that we should really be focusing this year on things that will make life safer for the people of Medford so I think that talking about accessibility improvements talking about pedestrian cyclist and driver safety improvements talking about trainings that we can fund for our First responders that they can do a better job and do the do the job that they want to be doing making life ever safer for Medford residents is where we should be focusing in this budget cycle and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=2091.092s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'd also like to just quickly co-sign the idea from Councilor Leming, funds to help us jumpstart our affordable housing linkage and update our linkage fees program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=2100.534s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These are funds where if we invest them now, we can see a return on investment from, we can make it so developers in our community are paying into these funds that we already know that we need and that will manifest in better funding for infrastructure and better funding for affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=2117.517s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=2632.885s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=2633.786s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was also trying to keep a list of suggestions that were made by multiple Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=2639.631s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll quickly run through mine, and if yourself or other Councilors hear ones that are missing, I'd welcome to hear that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=2646.778s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The notes I was taking, it sounds like from many of us, there was a shared priority around the citywide therapeutic inclusion recreation specialist, the office manager for Medford Recreation,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=2664.295s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Prioritizing the suggestions of the Medford Bicycle Advisory Commission as it pertains to both city staff and increasing infrastructure and signage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=2672.6s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One of those, of course, being a rather larger spend than the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=2675.521s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The request from the fire department on training for a fire department dive team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=2683.765s">[Kit Collins]</a>: increasing the salary line item for a city solicitor, meeting the Medford Public Schools and Medford Public Library budgetary requests, the nexus study for affordable housing linkage, and to update the linkage fees program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=2700.853s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and maintaining our grant-funded positions, notably the Community Liaisons Project, as well as other grant-funded positions in Outreach and Prevention, Planning, Development, Sustainability, and the Health Department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=2715.304s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sure that I missed a few, and I'd welcome additions to that list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=2720.368s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this is a great list, I think it's an ambitious list, and I think that these are all things and more that we absolutely should be funding this year as soon as possible because these would provide such an incredible return on investment for Medford residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=2735.527s">[Kit Collins]</a>: beyond the realm of what is quantifiable because of course we're talking about important educational experiences for kids in Medford, we're talking about important recreational experiences for all people in Medford, we're talking about safety improvements for all people in Medford, and we're talking about the city being better resourced to provide the type of services that Medford residents deserve and also expect from our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=2759.375s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this would be my short list for recommendations to come out of this meeting that we could push forward in additional meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=2765.76s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But of course I'd welcome discussion, modifications and additions to this list from my fellow Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=2988.092s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=2989.452s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes, I don't want to, I'd be happy to make the motion, but only if there's no other discussion or ideas from the fellow councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=2995.354s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that process sounds good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=2996.694s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It closely mirrors what we did last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3001.313s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I feel comfortable with this shortlist going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3003.855s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it represents a lot of the ideas that we've all talked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3007.877s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it'd be good to have this kind of top six compiled for our next meeting and sendable to the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3015.302s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would request that the individual budget memos submitted by Councilors also be included in the packet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3019.725s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm happy to make that in the form of a motion if there isn't any other discussion from Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3200.046s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bearson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3201.027s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I think that's a really good question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3204.171s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A question that's, you know, always on our minds and probably on the minds of residents as well as we approach budget season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3211.598s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One of the reasons that advocated two years ago for increased<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3216.043s">[Kit Collins]</a>: powers of the council during budget time so that we could have a seat at the table for that kind of question exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3221.166s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We do not have the power to make those decisions when it comes to how that reallocation process happens in the budgetary process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3233.094s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and how to, we don't have a seat at the table when it comes to getting in the weeds and saying this is exactly how we square that circle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3239.22s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When we get to the end of the budget process and we're trying to do everything that Medford residents deserve with a finite pool of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3247.647s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But at this stage, I do think it is valuable to put on the table and to emphasize everything that we know Medford residents deserve as prioritized as much as we are able to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3259.998s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then through the process, through our budgetary meetings with department heads, through our back and forth with the mayor to get that better understanding of what is possible, both financially and politically this year, and give us a clearer idea of if we are in a position of having to advocate for a small set of priorities, to be empowered to say, all right, given what's on the table,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3286.32s">[Kit Collins]</a>: these are our non-negotiables and try to make sure as best as we can that those happen for the good of the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3292.282s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So kind of a higher level question but just to reinforce that the city council doesn't, you know, I'm sure that we all would love the jurisdiction to get into the weeds and be able to talk reallocation and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3306.551s">[Kit Collins]</a>: seeing exactly how these things play out in the line items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3310.013s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For myself, I think it's valuable to start on the principles and to start saying, we know that all these things are things that we want and things that we believe the community wants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3321.319s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we know that we don't deserve anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3323.06s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We know that residents don't deserve anything less than what they're already accustomed to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3328.003s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let's start the conversation there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3330.044s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then in the process of the budget,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3332.185s">[Kit Collins]</a>: we're going to continue to have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3332.865s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Discussions in public meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3335.027s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um let's see how let's see how close we can get to making that real in budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3932.314s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears, for bringing that up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3935.236s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm glad that you raised that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3937.038s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I wasn't thinking about that when I was putting together my memo, but I'd be happy to put that forward at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3941.802s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that we all want to be in a position where if we do take a vote and approve a residential exemption this year, we want to be able to implement it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3949.328s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And the interim assessor made it very clear that he would need increased capacity in his department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3955.553s">[Kit Collins]</a>: starting early in the fiscal year to be able to do that so that residents could see the effects of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3961.216s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'd be happy to forward that at this time to also include that as a funded priority increased capacity for the assessor's department so that they'd be able to implement a residential exemption if one is approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3972.163s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also think that dovetails with some other notes that were raised by some of my fellow Councilors around capacity for the assessor's department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3978.988s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=545.363s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There will be a meeting of the Medford City Council Planning and Permitting Committee on Wednesday, March 12, 2025 at 6.20 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=556.687s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in the City Council Chamber, second floor, Medford City Hall, 85 George P. Hassett Drive, Medford MA and via Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=562.729s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=574.625s">[Kit Collins]</a>: present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=576.206s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Four present, one absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=578.488s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The meeting is called to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=580.489s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Apologize for the late start this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=582.871s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We had the swearing in for Fire Chief Evans in the chamber immediately before this meeting, and folks were busy doing the good work of mingling after that event wrapped up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=594.119s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We didn't want to rush them out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=597.03s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So the action and discussion item for tonight's meeting is, as it frequently is, paper 24-033, zoning ordinance updates with the Innes Associates team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=608.636s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is our 21st meeting on the zoning update project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=613.978s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have with us Paola from Innes Associates, in addition to city planning staff,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=619.742s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have a couple topics for tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=624.647s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As folks who have been engaged in this process might be aware, we recently wrapped up the Green Score Zoning Proposal and the Salem Street Corridor District Zoning Proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=635.358s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Those have been ordained as of last night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=638.234s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The neighborhood and urban residential zoning proposal was workshopped in this committee over the course of four meetings in January and February, and we are working to find a date for a public Q&A for that topic, after which it will be sent to the Community Development Board to begin the public hearing process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=659.89s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Tonight we're going to cover two topics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=662.552s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're going to start with a really high level introduction to a commercial framework for all of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=668.875s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Paola is going to walk us through a really bird's eye view of a way of looking at the commercial districts of our city, squares and corridors, major hubs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=679.601s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are not going to be voting on anything tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=681.903s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is intended as an introduction to this topic and an opportunity for councillors<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=686.846s">[Kit Collins]</a>: city staff and members of the public to state their initial questions, initial preferences, initial concerns for what they'd like to see in which areas, in which quarters, on which squares, what they'd like to see, what not they'd like to see, what questions they have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=702.965s">[Kit Collins]</a>: then City Council leadership, City staff, and NS Associates will take all of that feedback and work together to combine it into the next iteration of a commercial frameworks proposal for our next meeting on this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=717.595s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we're going to go through that introduction with Paola, and then after that, Paola will give us updates to the ADU zoning ordinance to incorporate the new state law on ADUs, and we'll have a further discussion of other ADU zoning proposals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=734.812s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So with that, unless there are any initial comments by councillors, and seeing none, I will pass it over to Paula from Ines Associates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=742.416s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=1471.912s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for the overview, Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=1474.254s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Really helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=1477.096s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So like we stated at the beginning, this is intended as kind of a bird's eye view introduction to this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=1484.861s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think the best use of our time in this meeting is kind of our first impressions, preferences, questions, and comments that Councilors are coming into this discussion with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=1494.067s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know I've gotten some questions and preferences from community members already saying,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=1500.912s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Why not this there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=1501.793s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Why not this there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=1503.074s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we'll save public comment for the end of this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=1509.839s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I first want to recognize Councilors who have some thoughts on this kind of initial jumping off point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=1517.465s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'll go first to President Bears on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=1890.797s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=1891.178s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Next, I'll recognize Councilor Callahan and then Councilor Lazzaro on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=1950.441s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Actually, that was a motion or a request that I made during the UR slash NR discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=1955.245s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I offer that if that's helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2051.224s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2052.285s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll go next to Councilor Latero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2109.358s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2113.481s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In my comments, I'll be brief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2115.783s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know I received a couple of comments from community members earlier this week, requesting specifically more density in Medford Square and West Medford Square, and I hear that reflected in the comments from some of my fellow councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2131.934s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Of course, we know that what exactly that means, what sub-district that means, how we're going to tailor it to specific squares and specific corridors will depend on where it's going and will depend on the research that Paula's already said she's going to do of lot size and what is feasible, kind of scaling down what we decide we want, the consensus we come to, to what is actually feasible on the lots in these specific locations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2154.6s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2154.84s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um but I do think in keeping with the goals, I think that here we have to in every part of the city that we look at that we rezone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2163.087s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have to be focused on the goals of, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2166.53s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Allowing for the type of development and density that we want to need in these specific places, and we also have to be keeping an eye on parity between all of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2183.368s">[Kit Collins]</a>: zoned much differently, given a different treatment than another, and that each area is able to enjoy the same potential for commercial and residential development and not left out of that potential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2195.102s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also wanted to note, and also I see that the section on the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2204.942s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The section to the west of 93, north of the river, that's currently penciled in as mixed-use 3, I just wanted to note, I think it's really interesting to be able to consider using mixed-use 3 zones along 93 where it's appropriate, and I think that there's a potential benefit there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2222.406s">[Kit Collins]</a>: where taller buildings could serve as sound insulation and kind of aesthetic insulation from the highway, from people who are living or just doing business or being around in those abutting areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2233.036s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm really eager for us to look at using those lots along the highway to concentrate more development, taller development,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2244.345s">[Kit Collins]</a>: city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2245.325s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When we go when we go tall, near the highway to block it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2248.907s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's also the point was made to me recently, I forget by who, that when you are developing at those level of heights, that's when the economics really makes sense for the kind of air filtration and soundproofing that can make quality of life inside those buildings better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2267.35s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Lastly, I just wanted to note I forgot to mention this at the beginning of the meeting, but the map that Councilors and community members are looking at tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2274.217s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A lot of this is the proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2276.159s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Some of this reflects proposals that have already been made in the case of some of the neighborhood residential and urban residential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2284.027s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Parts on this map, that's part of the proposal that's going to the CD board next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2287.668s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And as I think we're probably all aware, the Mystic Avenue corridor and the Salem Street corridor reflects zoning that was done earlier in the citywide process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2296.97s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I just wanted to make that clear for folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2298.97s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A lot of this is just our jumping off point that we will further workshop and change and tweak and become part of the proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2304.372s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And some of it along Salem Street and Mystic Avenue in particular reflects rezoning that we've already done earlier in the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2312.044s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll go back to President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2462.472s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2469.643s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Looking for fellow comments from Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2474.248s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a great jumping off point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2476.871s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that this gives us kind of enough to get out of the starting blocks on tweaking this initial proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2489.864s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I believe<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2491.027s">[Kit Collins]</a>: double check with Paula but I believe that our next meeting in two weeks we can probably expect to see a revised version of this map, including just some formatting changes to make it clear to Councilors and residents, which parts of the map have already been updated which have not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2507.283s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we might see some changes as well, perhaps in sub districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2512.166s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Along the lines of President Bears his comment or begin to see tweaks to the map.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2516.928s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Based on Councilors and community members feedback for what they'd really like to see prioritized in each of these squares and corridors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2572.635s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2575.986s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you, Councilor Halihan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2577.907s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And as Councilor Leming noted, we're having some trouble getting the agenda files published for this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2585.029s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm not sure why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2585.77s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was inside Civic Clerk just at the beginning of the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2589.191s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The agenda files are there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2591.852s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They're not on the public side of the portal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2594.053s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I apologize for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2595.373s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We will make sure that is figured out ASAP, and I'm sure that these<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2599.535s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Files that we're looking at tonight will be viewable by everybody by tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2605.179s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we will also make sure that the updated that the version of the of this map that Councilors received on Monday didn't have the legend on it will make sure that the public portal is updated with the one that does have the ID for what each of the MX sub districts mean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2619.61s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So apologize for the technical difficulties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2622.794s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We will make sure that the publishing function on Civiclerk is fixed ASAP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2633.441s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2634.021s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing no further comments from Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2636.702s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for your initial feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2638.623s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So far, I look forward to seeing this in its next iteration and I think it goes without saying to anybody who's engaged with this process enough to be a part of this meeting, but I do just want to reemphasize for folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2651.208s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think sometimes when we see these zoning proposals come out you know a piece here a piece there can sometimes be confusing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2657.23s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Why is this quarter colored in and this current quarter isn't why is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2661.912s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is certain color and this is blank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2664.035s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is because that we're, we're kind of breaking the city into its different, you know constituent parks, which are corridors which are squares which are squarely residential which are kind of none of the above.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2675.257s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and we're taking a different approach to each of those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2678.96s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So if you happen to be looking at your street and you're saying, why are they talking about that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2682.923s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It seems like they should be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2684.985s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's likely a part of a different discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2688.808s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And of course, if you ever have questions, if you have further feedback on this proposal, you can always feel free to reach out to city councilors in between these meetings and we're always happy to clarify.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2699.743s">[Kit Collins]</a>: see no further comment from city Councilors on this part of the presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2703.207s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So before we move on, I want to take Oh, sorry, I didn't invite participation from city staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2707.673s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is there any feedback or notes that you want to put on the record at this time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2714.901s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No pressure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2739.316s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you, Director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2741.864s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, we will go next to public comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2745.286s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're eager to hear your thoughts on this very initial framework, which is due for a lot of tweaking and feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2752.47s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I will alternate between the podium and Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2754.752s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Every speaker will have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2757.433s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I will endeavor to give you a 30 second warning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=2762.016s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3049.929s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm going to ask you to unmute, JMN.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3054.832s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3056.013s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please, and you have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3154.234s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, we will go to J.R.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3161.863s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Elliott on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3164.145s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3165.407s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And you'll have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3173.52s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm asking you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3306.109s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Uh, you have a little less than a minute left.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3307.649s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Uh, please feel to feel free to ask any questions and I'll answer them all at the end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3314.385s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, great, thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3315.526s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just didn't wanna cut you off on your time there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3317.967s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No, this map is absolutely not finished.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3320.429s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is our very first meeting on the commercial framework.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3324.011s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And the intent of tonight, as I stated at the beginning of the meeting, is for this to serve as a jumping off point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3330.635s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is kind of our first crack at looking at the totality of the commercial framework.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3334.898s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So your comments are extremely welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3337.079s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The point of tonight is to get this kind of initial feedback, impressions, questions, concerns,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3343.384s">[Kit Collins]</a>: with this draft of a commercial framework.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3345.625s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Our goal is absolutely not to down zone any part of the city through any of these proposals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3351.45s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So if there are aspects on this map where inadvertently a mixed use area is not included as a mixed use zone, that's something that we'll absolutely want to check and make sure that's not the case because any area that's already mixed use, certainly it's not the intent of the overhaul to decrease mixed use<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3369.325s">[Kit Collins]</a>: uses in the city, we want to increase them where they make sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3373.067s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And another goal is to decrease non-conformities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3375.369s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So if you're noticing them on the map, please do put them in writing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3378.19s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You can send them to Director Hunt and myself and we'll make sure that we look at them and make sure that they fit in with this plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3387.096s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But to your overall point, this is by no means<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3391.458s">[Kit Collins]</a>: final version of this map, we're actually going to be going square by square, corridor by corridor, to make sure that the new subdistricts and the uses are tailored to each specific square and corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3402.742s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this is intended as kind of a 30,000-foot view.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3405.423s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll collect all these questions, concerns, and then we'll go granular on each area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3410.945s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you for your comments, and don't worry, we'll be talking way more about this before we take any votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3418.21s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is there any additional public comment on Zoom or in the chambers before we move on to our second topic for the evening?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3425.772s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing none, thank you for your comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3429.473s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've been taking copious notes, and I'm sure that we will have a very interesting updated version of the commercial framework map for our consideration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3439.438s">[Kit Collins]</a>: or a portion thereof for consideration at our next planning and permitting committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3444.821s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I also do just want to clarify, depending on what makes most sense for the council's workflow, we might see a updated version of this map in its totality, or we might kind of dilate the telescope onto a specific square or corridor like we were talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3461.248s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3461.648s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you all so much for your comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3463.549s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Paola, I'll turn it back over to you and we can begin our discussion of the updates to the ADU ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3883.002s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3884.644s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just to repeat that back in simplified layman's terms, for those less familiar with this topic, the new state law places several new mandatory regulations on cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3900.483s">[Kit Collins]</a>: around essentially that we are not allowed to prohibit ADUs in these new sets of circumstances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3908.67s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so we are updating our ADU ordinance to be in compliance with the new state law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3914.514s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Beyond that, there are several options that we can take for ways we might want to tailor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3921.58s">[Kit Collins]</a>: construction the use of ADUs further based on our specific zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3926.302s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So it strikes me that the work before us is to essentially approve the amendments to our existing ADU ordinance, incorporating the mandatory updates from the state, and then to make those decisions on ways that we might want to further handle the treatment of ADUs based on the decisions that the state is leaving up to municipalities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3943.707s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3943.907s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't know if that's correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3945.169s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um do I have a correct that a lot of the updates that were suggested in the new draft 80 ordinance from Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3950.293s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It sounds like many of those have been covered by the new state regulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3953.536s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4191.63s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4193.031s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4327.614s">[Kit Collins]</a>: great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4327.874s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I do think that gets to one of the questions before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4330.935s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, but we're not bound by state law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4332.355s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One of the things that is up to the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4334.836s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, should we allow 80 years in any residential district, not just the districts where a single family housing is allowed by right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4343.859s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, so we hear recommendation from Councilor Leming, um, to paraphrase you that we should Go next to a couple of our non voting members on zoom Councilor Lazzaro, and then we'll go to Councilor Tseng<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4441.686s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Council Liz Howard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4442.906s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So to paraphrase, and please let me know if I captured your concern correctly, I think I'm hearing a question about if allowing ADUs beyond what the state mandates, if we're making those by right, sorry, if we're making those by special permit as opposed to by right, if that is gonna be prohibitive to people actually following through on those projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4464.89s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Planner Evans or Director Hunt, can you speak to a recommendation on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4492.503s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think there's maybe two questions here, because the ADUs in districts where single families are allowed by right, the ADUs are allowed by right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4502.687s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think the two questions before us are,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4505.128s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If we decide to allow ADUs in other residential districts where there were single families not allowed by right, do we want to allow ADUs there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4515.336s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And if so, should it be special permitted or by right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4518.338s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then in addition to that, if we're allowing a second ADU, are those by right or those have to be by special permit?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4717.413s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, we should probably be both speaking into the microphone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4860.156s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If I can zoom us... Oh, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4861.937s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll go to you in just a second, Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4865.178s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's really helpful, and I do think, especially for people who are new to this topic, it can be a little bit confusing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4872.491s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that there's kind of a flowchart of options before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4875.295s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's the bulk of this, we don't have an option on because it's state law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4878.959s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In any sub-district that allows single-family homes by right, we must allow ADUs by right for all types of housing within that sub-district, not just the single-family homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4890.17s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we kind of have a short flow chart of decisions before us that are under our jurisdiction as a city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4897.1s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Should we allow ADUs in any residential subdistrict, not just the ones that allow single family homes by right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4905.832s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If so, should they be by right or special permitted and should be tried to tailor by on what lots, they may occur either by right or by special permit and I do agree with the comments from our PDF staff that there are some types of structures, especially in you are one and you are two or just wouldn't make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4925.238s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to have an ADU on one of our denser housing, on one of our most dense housing types.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4931.52s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think the next major decision bucket is should we allow a second ADU on lots that already have one, by special permit, and if yes, in what districts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4943.725s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's another question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4945.385s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Who should be the special permit grant authority for ADUs that are specially permitted?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4949.827s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It seems like the clear recommendation there is it should be the CDB.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4952.568s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4955.028s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Do we want to allow ADUs that are bigger than 900 square feet or more than half of the floor area of the principal area?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4962.856s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And if yes, by right or by special permit?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4967.48s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then finally, we haven't even touched on this yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4969.522s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Do we want to consider a short-term rental option for ADUs and what would the recommendations for regulations be there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4977.088s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So far, our conversation has been mostly around those first three questions, but I did just want to orient us in the questions before us so that when we leave this meeting and as associates kind of has a better<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4993.721s">[Kit Collins]</a>: all of the feedback that they might need to start drafting the updates to the ordinance for us based on the stuff that is under our jurisdiction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5002.109s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So eager to hear more comments from councilors on kind of the three main questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5006.633s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In my mind, should we be allowing ADUs in any residential sub-district, not just the ones that allow single families by right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5012.658s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Should we be allowing a second ADU and special permit and in what districts under what conditions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5018.183s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go next to Councilor Tseng and then President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5265.42s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Sheng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5269.05s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go next to President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5373.634s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5375.295s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go back to Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5509.573s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, sorry, we couldn't hear your last comment, Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5514.256s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you for the question, Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5517.518s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go next to Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5785.178s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And if I'm<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5787.099s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5787.279s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If I may.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5787.559s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do want to note and sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5797.782s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5799.942s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for the discussion on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5801.682s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do want to note.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5802.323s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think all Councilors are certainly aware of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5805.523s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5806.924s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The current Medford short term rental ordinance gets<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5816.746s">[Kit Collins]</a>: most closely on this ordinance, that the issue really has been enforcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5821.35s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that that is our first major obstacle to clear, which is, I think we're all aware of the enforcement issues across many departments of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5831.46s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Outside of the scope of zoning, I think that the first question is, what is the, kind of, what utility would we want to get out of allowing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5840.613s">[Kit Collins]</a>: creating special regulations for short-term rental of Airbnbs, sorry, short-term rentals at all, maybe guided by the context of our enforcement problems so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5856.222s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Personally, as one Councilor,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5860.528s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I am not interested in kind of tailoring our updated ADU ordinance to short-term rentals at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5869.94s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One of the reasons why I'm excited about this ordinance is because studies of housing in Medford have shown that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5876.922s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, we have a housing shortage, but we also have a shortage of very specific types of housing, in particular, including small apartments for people who live alone, students, people who are downsizing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5887.839s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that's one really important thing to come out of allowing more<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5892.752s">[Kit Collins]</a>: ADUs, I would be, I'm kind of, I'm feeling very protective of if we are able to pass regulations that allow more ADUs to flourish where they're appropriate in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5903.926s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would really want those to be protected as a mechanism for adding more of those small types of housing to the community because we know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5911.896s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think this is in the housing production plan, that a particular shortage of housing type is people who would really like to live alone and they don't need a lot of space, but they have to live with roommates or with family when they prefer not to, because there just aren't studios and one bedrooms available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5928.491s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That would be my preference, is to not consider regulations for a short-term rental for ADUs at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5938.93s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing no hands raised from councillors at this time, I'll just throw my two cents in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5943.917s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to make sure that we leave this meeting with at least kind of a draft of the consensus for where to go on these main questions for Innes Associates that we can hopefully look at draft amended language in a meeting or two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5957.314s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For myself, I would like to see ADUs allowed in all of our residential districts, not just ones where single families are allowed by right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5966.598s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think especially since we have this kind of like staircase mechanism with our residential districts, a lot of housing types carry over from one to the next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5975.882s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So to me, it would be arbitrary to say, well,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5979.022s">[Kit Collins]</a>: this historic conversion, or this two-unit dwelling unit can have an ADU because it's in this subdistrict, but this other housing type, which is exactly the same, but it's in a different subdistrict, cannot have an ADU under the same conditions just because the subdistrict that it's in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5996.251s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'd like to see ADUs allowed in all residential subdistricts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6000.773s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I agree with the idea thrown out by President Bears that I think when we get into UR1 and UR2, it makes sense to be looking at by right for detached, like kind of where detached is spatially possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6017.507s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it makes sense for that to be by right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6021.19s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then by right for attached or detached in any neighborhood residential district for anything other than a multiplex.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6033.479s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6035.803s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In terms of the question around, should we allow second ADUs by special permit?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6042.707s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6043.607s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's hard for me to picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6045.348s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Obviously, I'm always happy to consider recommendations from city staff or our consultants, but it's hard for me to picture a lot where it kind of makes sense to have two detached ADUs on the same property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6056.274s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it could make sense to look at where would it make sense to allow a second ADU if detached, where there's already a detached one, or vice versa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6066.691s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm happy to defer to the planner's recommendations on if we should allow ADUs bigger than 900 square feet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6073.878s">[Kit Collins]</a>: 900 square feet is quite small, so I don't think that that square footage needs to be set in stone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6078.702s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm happy to consider something a little bit larger.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6083.266s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Was there anything that I missed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6087.59s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm not sure I don't think so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6098.615s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any other comments from Councilors at this time on the treatment of ADUs in other sub districts than the ones where single family is allowed by right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6112.964s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And how those ADUs should be treated, i.e.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6115.685s">[Kit Collins]</a>: by right or by special permit?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6120.308s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Or if it depends on what housing type.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6127.566s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, hearing none, we will go to, sorry, give me a second here, I'm rearranging my windows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6143.298s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, so I think we're kind of winding down for the night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6145.419s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I wanna make sure that, oh, Councilor Leming, is that a hand raised?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6150.023s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6200.52s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, was that you wanted a reiteration of the zoning timeline that we got at the beginning of the meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6208.003s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I think I'm not sure if Paula covered that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6210.604s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We can... Yes, let's close out councilor comment and public comment on ADUs, and then we can start with a review of the... Then we can... Sorry, we can end with a review of the timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6223.902s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, let's go to public comment, then I'll summarize our next steps on ADUs, and then we can review the timeline before we adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6230.344s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, public participation, seeing nobody at the podium, I will go to Gaston on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6235.746s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please, and you'll have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6335.338s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6335.678s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Gaston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6337.518s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll go next to Matthew on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6341.48s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6433.226s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Matthew.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6437.307s">[Kit Collins]</a>: going next to Judith.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6438.748s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6440.048s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And you'll have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6526.577s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, thank you for the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6527.618s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Paola, are you able to speak to that, how lot size of the principal structure would factor in in areas where ABUs per state law should be allowed by rent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6701.732s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6704.953s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you very much for the clarifying question, Judith.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6708.525s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have one minute left if you have any other questions for us tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6715.193s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6716.475s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you to all who gave public comment and asked questions about this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6723.424s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just to quickly recap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6727.259s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We went over what is required of us per the new state law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6731.381s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then we have discussed potential answers to the questions that are before us as a city, things that we do get some leeway on from the state that are left unanswered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6741.005s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What I heard<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6742.477s">[Kit Collins]</a>: from the discussion on the question of should we allow ADUs in any residential sub-district and not just those that allow single-family homes by right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6749.826s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I heard from my fellow councilors that yes, we do want to see ADUs allowed in all residential sub-districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6755.312s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We want to have some level of parity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6758.095s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in what's allowed for these different housing types, even across residential sub-district lines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6764.477s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oops, didn't turn my timer off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6767.597s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But we do wanna see some tailoring and exceptions, especially when we get into the most dense housing types.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6773.519s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think it makes sense for us to receive a recommendation from the zoning consultant along those lines, factoring that in, whether it's certain types of ADUs being allowed on certain housing types,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6787.635s">[Kit Collins]</a>: by special permit, depending on the district, along with the recommendations that were made by councilors earlier in the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6796.382s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So more allowance of ADUs across residential areas, but tailoring to make sure that it's appropriate and makes sense with housing stock, especially when you get into those denser housing types.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6810.045s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We discussed allowing a second ADU by in residential districts, which residential districts and should it be by special permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6818.409s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It sounds like there's an interest in seeing a special permit option and also seeing a little bit of tailoring, depending on that we're not seeing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6826.55s">[Kit Collins]</a>: two detached ADUs on one yard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6829.273s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think all of these should reflect that the CDB should be the special permit granting authority where there is a special permit involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6836.12s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we're looking for a little bit of flexibility when it comes to that maximum square footage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6842.086s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You could hear a recommendation there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6845.985s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it sounds like we would also like to see some information about possible mechanisms within zoning for enforcement of short term rentals of ADUs for if that becomes relevant now or in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6864.4s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any additional comment from city councilors or city staff at this time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6871.632s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6872.313s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing none, thank you so much for kicking us off on these two topics tonight, Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6878.058s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6878.859s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this was a very substantive discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6881.241s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're looking forward to seeing an updated<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6887.328s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're looking forward to our next step when it comes to the commercial framework.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6889.849s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And next, we will be dialing in on specific squares and corridors and giving those a granular tailored treatment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6895.252s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And also look forward to seeing updated draft amendment text for the ADU ordinance to incorporate the new state law and also the local ADU options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6907.139s">[Kit Collins]</a>: With that, can we quickly review the upcoming schedule before we adjourn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6924.167s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, so it is our first planning and permitting meeting of March.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6932.944s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We discussed<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6936.402s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We had our first look at a draft commercial framework earlier tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6939.965s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're going to be focusing next on Medford Square and then West Medford Square and then proceeding along to other corridors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6948.13s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're going to be taking a really specific look at each of these the same way that we did with Mystic Ave and with Salem Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6956.036s">[Kit Collins]</a>: At the same time, we are going to continue talking about updates to the ADU, and we also plan to talk<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6963.342s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let me start over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6965.405s">[Kit Collins]</a>: At the same time as we are talking about these geographies, we will also continue talking about these citywide topics, such as ADUs, which we just discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6973.316s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Also included is community solar, nonconforming uses and structures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6977.322s">[Kit Collins]</a>: By April, we hope to have progressed along to West Medford Square and our discussions of squares and corridors, part of the commercial street framework.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6985.245s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And hopefully by then we'll be able to talk about transportation demand management, site plan review, and neighborhood nodes as another citywide topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6994.949s">[Kit Collins]</a>: By May, we hope to be looking at the Wellington slash Glenwood geography and talking about parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=7005.193s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any questions on the timeline?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=7007.452s">[Kit Collins]</a>: continue to update this as we go along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=7015.577s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=7016.398s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing none, I'll recognize Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=7119.364s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=7120.205s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We will work to work that into the timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=7126.511s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=7126.771s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you all for a substantive discussion tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=7130.234s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Do I hear a motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=7135.659s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to adjourn by Councilor Callahan, seconded by Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=7140.383s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=7145.995s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And while I'm waiting for the clerk, I will just note that we will, like we said, we'll figure out what's going on with civic clerk post haste.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=7153.157s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we will also work to quickly get the zoning page of the website updated with these new topics in progress and all schedule updates will be posted there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=7178.817s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=7179.64s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Four in favor, none opposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=7181.966s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=7183.15s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=1782.338s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=1782.618s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just want to thank you so much for being here tonight, to you and the rest of the commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=1787.482s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Really appreciate the work that you do year round and I, you know, I want to echo the point that you made earlier in your presentation that it is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=1797.163s">[Kit Collins]</a>: unfortunate and outrageous that a lot of the time action on bike safety, road safety issues in general is motivated by preventable tragedies occurring in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=1805.209s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm sorry that you have to do the work that you do, but thank you for helping us rise to the occasion and make things safer for cyclists and pedestrians and drivers and everybody going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=1815.257s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm so glad that this discussion is happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=1817.539s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm a cyclist myself, but I think we're all, whether you own a bike or not, we're all aligned for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=1824.022s">[Kit Collins]</a>: doing what we can concretely to make the road safer for everybody and as I think people know if you look at the side of the road or right in front of you when you're driving around or on the bus in Medford cyclists in Medford in our in our surrounding communities they look like everybody, their commuters, their kids going to school, their elders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=1842.174s">[Kit Collins]</a>: it's incredibly important that we do whatever infrastructural work and whatever funding is necessary to bring about these changes that are documented to keep people safer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=1851.139s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I will support any budgetary proposal that we submit to the mayor this spring for FY26 to move the needle on these things that will make cycling safer in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=1862.946s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to echo your gratitude<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=1865.447s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to Director Blake for the hard work that him and his team have been doing to expand our network of bike lanes in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=1872.429s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Bike lanes alone are not enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=1874.63s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is also incredibly important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=1876.07s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know the commission has been working hard on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=1877.531s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's incredibly important to know that, to work so that drivers know how to behave around cyclists and around bike lanes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=1886.093s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we have a lot of work to do in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=1889.114s">[Kit Collins]</a>: so that people know the rules of the road and they respect them for their own safety and for other people's safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=1895.757s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I look forward to continuing these conversations so that we can put money where it needs to be so that people are safer on the roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YmTUDvxJO2o&t=1903.899s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=0.071s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Our deepest condolences to the family, friends and loved ones of Maxwell liner Max was my friend of over 15 years and together we are both graduates of Medford High School class of 2011 and University of Massachusetts Amherst class of 2015.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13.845s">[Kit Collins]</a>: He was a deeply caring person who spent his personal and professional lives, making a positive impact on people through his work in medical care and his loyalty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=29.854s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm going to start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=30.334s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm going to start again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=31.654s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=55.536s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we send our deepest condolences to the family, friends, and loved ones of Maxwell Leiner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=62.842s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Max was my friend of over 15 years, and together we were both graduates of the Medford High School class of 2011 and University of Massachusetts Amherst class of 2015.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=72.35s">[Kit Collins]</a>: He was a deeply caring person who spent his personal and professional lives making a positive impact on people through his work in medical care and his loyalty and devotion to family and friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=82.258s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Be it further resolved that we dedicate this meeting in his honor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=86.38s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=137.464s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I will just say, only knowing a little bit about Maxwell, what a deep, deep loss that our community has suffered through his untimely passing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=145.09s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are going to dedicate this meeting and its offer, and I'd like for us to all stand for a moment of silence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=205.036s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The records of the February 25th meeting were passed to Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=209.118s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Leming, how did you find them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=306.229s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Like I mentioned, it was preceded by three other topics during which we workshop this proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=311.41s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And at the February 26 meeting we referred it out to the city council for its immediate procedural referral to the Community Development Board for further<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=945.849s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, President Bears, for the overview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=951.467s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know a lot of people are here tonight for this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=953.508s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm really excited that we've made it to this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=955.41s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm excited that so many people are here engaging with the comprehensive zoning overhaul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=961.574s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Before we get into discussion, I'm sure there will be a lot of discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=964.176s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to give a brief overview of the proposal before us, how we got to this point, the meetings that we had, what the proposal says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=972.841s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm then going to ask President Bears to recognize Emily Innis from Innes Associates to walk us through on a more<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=980.006s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the planning and permitting committee meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=981.227s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Detail technically technical level and overview of the proposal before us tonight now that it's come back from the CD board, and then I am eager to hear discussion from my fellow Councilors and from the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=992.193s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'll start with a quick outline of the public meetings on this topic that got us to today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=996.636s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This proposal was developed as all of the other zoning proposals were in this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1001.939s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um in the planning and permitting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1009.223s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The CDB began its public hearing on this topic on January 22nd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1014.045s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That is a step that we always take with any zoning proposal or any zoning change or amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1018.727s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It always goes from the city council to the CDB board for their public hearings before it comes back to the city council and that's what that last step is what's happening tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1027.452s">[Kit Collins]</a>: but the CDB began its public hearing on January 22nd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1030.994s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There was a lot of community feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1032.354s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A lot of people in this room know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1033.915s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So the public hearing was continued to March 5th to allow more time for the board to consider and deliberate and to allow for more opportunities for public comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1042.079s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In the interim, we added a new step to our review timeline, which is a public Q&A.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1046.241s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We had that on February 10th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1048.482s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This wasn't something that we did for our phase one zoning updates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1051.483s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It wasn't something that we did for the Mystic Avenue corridor district proposal, which passed in December.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1056.353s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But with Salem Street, we heard really loud, really clear that people wanted more information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1060.496s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They wanted more opportunities to ask questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1062.857s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They wanted more opportunities to give public comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1065.519s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I want to thank city staff and Innes Associates for their flexibility and making sure that we got a local in-person Q&A on the calendar, which I understand a lot of residents attended, and I'm so glad that they did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1077.106s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On March 5th, the CDB had the continuation of its public hearing on the Salem Street Corridor District.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1082.853s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They reviewed updated recommendations from the zoning consultant that were put forward after all of the public feedback that was heard on February 10th, and they heard additional public comment on that night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1094.386s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that brings us to today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1096.708s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And in addition to this public meetings, these public meetings, they also want to note, I know for I as one Councilor, I've been receiving a lot of public feedback throughout the process of the zoning, through emails, through phone calls, through texts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1108.795s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sure that all of my colleagues have too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1110.937s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I want to again, thank everybody for engaging with us on this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1114.079s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I hope that you'll continue to do so as we approach other topics through the spring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1119.987s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Another important part of this process, I think, are the new resources that we added during the Salem Street phase of the zoning overhaul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1128.43s">[Kit Collins]</a>: While Salem Street was working its way through the committee to CBB back to City Council process, city staff have worked alongside myself and President Bears to overhaul the communications and online resources that we publish about zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1142.175s">[Kit Collins]</a>: creating new ones and making sure that we're using all of the communication channels that the city has.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1146.64s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We spent many hours on a total redesign of the zoning website so that it's easier for residents to learn about proposals, upcoming meeting dates, look at visuals and graphics, and separate fact from fiction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1159.495s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I say it a lot, I know that zoning is really detailed, it's really technical, it's often confusing, and not just for residents, for city staff and Councilors alike, but I also know that Medford residents don't scare off that easy, and I'm really glad that the community has encouraged us to overhaul the information that we have online so that it's easier for residents to be informed and involved, and we're continuing to work with the mayor's office to keep making that better and better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1182.924s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So onto this specific proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1184.726s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I will give a high level like I said I'll give a high level overview of what's before us before Emily will walk us through more of the details.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1192.533s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The Salem Street corridor district proposal is one part of our comprehensive and citywide zoning overhaul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1198.84s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This began in the spring of 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1201.342s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Green Score and the Salem Street Corridor District are the third and fourth major packages to come out of this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1207.066s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They were predated by the phase one technical updates and the Mystic Ave Corridor District proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1212.989s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Overall, the goal of this process is to take the goals and the visions of the Housing Production Plan, the Comprehensive Plan, and the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan and help make them real in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1223.512s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These plans were not written by the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1225.573s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They didn't come out of this room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1227.375s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These plans were the product of years of community feedback, community meetings, and community feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1232.798s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They speak to our shared goals for the future that we all love.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1236.081s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A future of the city where there are homes for young adults who can afford to settle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1239.843s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Apartments where students and workers can live comfortably and where our elders can downsize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1244.245s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Neighborhood squares that are lively and full of businesses and people running errands and meeting friends close to where they live and where we are more climate resilient than we are today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1252.729s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So what do these goals look like for Salem Street specifically?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1255.511s">[Kit Collins]</a>: How does this end up in the proposal that we're talking about tonight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1258.692s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This proposal allows for moderately increased residential housing on Salem Street from the 93 Rotary up through Haines Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1266.435s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We can do that by regulating density, height, and lot size principally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1270.916s">[Kit Collins]</a>: By-right densities are moderately changing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1273.977s">[Kit Collins]</a>: By-right heights are also moderately changing, but they are not always increasing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1278.699s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Right now, maximum by-right heights for most of the corridor is three stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1283.38s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Under this proposal, that's staying much the same everywhere except for in mixed-use two sub-districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1289.283s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In mixed-use two sub-districts, it's proposed to go up by one story, so you can build to four stories as your buy-right maximum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1296.828s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In Haines Square, this proposal would actually lower maximum heights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1300.73s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Right now, if you wanted to, which I don't think a lot of residents would want to, you could be building a six-story apartment building or a 15-story hotel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1308.795s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This proposal will bring that down to scale.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1312.696s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I next want to quickly touch on commercial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1315.058s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Salem Street, we all know, is characterized by many beloved small businesses from convenience stores to karate dojos to bike shops, and all of them are nonconforming under our current zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1326.285s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This proposal allows for ground level commercial buy right to encourage small business development and make it easier to see more of these things and these types of businesses that we already love.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1335.191s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll quickly touch on incentive zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1340.624s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Through incentive zoning under this proposal, it is possible to build above the three-story maximum and the four-story maximum by right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1348.291s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Developers could build up to four stories in mixed-use one sub-districts and up to six stories in mixed-use two and commercial sub-districts if they maximally satisfy a certain community benefit conditions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1361.804s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Incentive zoning increases are not allowed in multi-unit residential sub-districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1366.328s">[Kit Collins]</a>: those areas top out at three stories permanently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1369.23s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's no opportunity for going above three there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1372.533s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do want to stress that incentive zoning is not a blank check for developers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1377.056s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any uses that are not by right uses will still go through site plan review and public permitting procedures that involve studies and negotiation of community benefits and impact mitigation agreements on a case-by-case basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1390.709s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This proposal also includes development context standards, regulations for how upper floors must be built and shaped to ensure that new buildings don't feel out of place nor block light from existing residential homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1404.344s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The committee, the consultant, and the CDB also paid special consideration to what kind of uses the community did and did not want on Salem Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1412.154s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And Emily Ennis will speak more about that next, but I'll just quickly mention this zoning proposal does reflect changes to allowed uses based on a lot of community feedback that we heard throughout January and February.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1424.548s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Under this proposal, the only medical uses in the district will be quote-unquote neighborhood medical, which is a new defined term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1430.992s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They are no more than 1,500 square feet and no more than five employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1435.734s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Neighborhood medical will be allowed by special permit only in mixed use two and commercial sub-districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1441.257s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Hotels, which are allowed under our current zoning, would be prohibited under this proposal throughout the entire corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1448.521s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I want to quickly speak to what this proposal does not allow, because there's been a lot of talk about this proposal in this community, and not all of it is accurate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1455.606s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want us to be armed with the facts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1458.809s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that there's been a lot of concern about what zoning in the city will allow for large dorms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1464.493s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This zoning proposal does not create conditions for large dorms on Salem Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1469.257s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In fact, this proposal recommends no dorms at all, and no sub-district all along the corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1475.441s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Neither would it create the conditions for pot shops, all marijuana commercial uses, including retail are prohibited along this corridor boarding houses are allowed only by special permit, they are disallowed in multi unit residential sub districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1491.083s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know there's some concern about historic buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1493.605s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Buildings over 75 years old are protected by the city's demolition delay ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1499.007s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Buildings can be further protected by the establishment of historic districts, whereby changes can be regulated by the Historic District Commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1507.011s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This council this term has been supportive of those districting measures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1511.673s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and I'm sure would welcome further collaboration on historic preservation along Salem Street and along other corridors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1518.921s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Broadly speaking, and this applies not only to historic structures, but to structures in general, if any use or structure is rendered nonconforming because of zoning changes, they can continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1529.952s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There are specific rules that govern nonconforming uses, but right now, Salem Street and much of the city<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1535.955s">[Kit Collins]</a>: is peppered with nonconforming buildings and lots, which may remain in perpetuity except as outlined under Mass General Law, Chapter 40A.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1546.266s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Lastly, I'll quickly speak to a concern that I know a lot of people have around traffic, traffic impact along Salem Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1553.289s">[Kit Collins]</a>: First, I will note there are no parking changes proposed in this proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1559.531s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that a lot of folks have been concerned about impact on existing uses and structures through traffic on Salem Street and eager to see the impact on traffic because of changes that might come about through zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1573.256s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When we talk about zoning,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1575.257s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're talking about changes that will occur over the long term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1578.52s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Some changes might occur relatively quickly within the next five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1582.002s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Some changes might not become manifest for decades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1585.245s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That is why in the review process, it is more effective, more beneficial to the community to keep traffic and impact mitigation studies where they currently reside, which is at the point of permitting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1596.153s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A traffic study done today or done this year might be completely outdated, irrelevant, unhelpful to the community when a new proposal is proposed under the current zoning in five years, in 10 years, in 20 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1609.805s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Those type of impact studies are located at the time of permitting so that the community has the best information it can use when it's doing those negotiation, impact study, and community benefit negotiations with developers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1624.9s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've spoken a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1626.481s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to pass the mic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1627.321s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll ask President Bears to next recognize Emily Innis from Innes Associates, a familiar face to most of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1632.603s">[Kit Collins]</a>: She is going to walk us through a more detailed, more technical overview of the recommendations to this proposal that have come out of the Community Development Board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=1642.788s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I thank my fellow councilors for giving me this time to give an overview of this proposal, and I look forward to our discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13282.873s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13283.735s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And before I begin, I want to say thank you to every person who attended and spoke and shared your perspective with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13289.888s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know it takes a lot to spend your evenings this way, and it's really appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13295.08s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Not everybody will feel represented by this, but in listening to public comment over the past few hours I noted that many speakers, even when they were here to explain why they were not in favor of this proposal, affirmed that they agree that zoning in principle is needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13309.251s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We also heard a lot about concerns about problems that zoning may worsen, or that zoning will not help us to make progress on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13317.357s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I again want to quickly restate and affirm that changing zoning is not the same as flipping a switch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13323.179s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Some lots may be developed very quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13325.98s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Many will not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13327.141s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Many will take years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13328.281s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a long-term plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13332.743s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As we deliberate, I urge my colleagues and my fellow community members to not mistake standing still for moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13339.225s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I want to make really clear that neglecting to rezone for the 21st century<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13343.629s">[Kit Collins]</a>: will not allow us to improve parking enforcement, slow traffic, get cars off the road, improve sidewalks, improve crosswalks, improve infrastructure capacity, prevent businesses from getting displaced due to escalating commercial rents, prevent people from getting displaced due to escalating residential rents, make it easier to buy homes in Medford, improve heat islands or pollution, or force the MBTA to speed up the bus network redesign rollout.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13371.199s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Zoning alone<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13373.067s">[Kit Collins]</a>: will fix none of these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13375.037s">[Kit Collins]</a>: zoning is one part of a multi-part strategy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13378.098s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It must fit in with, and it does fit in with, linkage fees, impact fees, increasing our school capacity, improving our water and sewer infrastructure, improving our roads, holding electricity utilities accountable, expanding our tree canopy, holding developers to higher environmental standards citywide, making it easier for businesses to find a home in Medford, traffic calming, road improvements, holding the DOT and the DCR accountable to making state roads safer,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13404.162s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All of these projects are currently underway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13407.323s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They occur parallel to the zoning effort at the same time as we contemplate rezoning and stopping a decades overdue zoning project will not help any of these projects that are occurring in tandem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13419.406s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They're also towards goals that I believe we all share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13422.626s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It will much more likely help us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13425.587s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know a lot of people have tonight talked about the revenue that we will enjoy because of uptoning through permitting fees and for new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13434.495s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That is not the reason that we zone, or at least it's not the reason that I come to the zoning effort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13439.677s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that that's true for most people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13441.918s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We don't zone because of the revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13443.839s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But it is true that the development will raise our commercial tax base and help us pay for the things that we know we need, many of the things that were mentioned tonight, from infrastructure improvements to paying our public workers better,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13456.837s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and attracting great new workers to City Hall, to stump removal and planting trees and parking enforcement, and being able to fund more school buses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13464.724s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We need funding to do these things, and this will help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13467.386s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also want to touch again on studies because those were talked about a lot tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13473.817s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Not to be repetitive, but site plan review process and special permit process is governed by state law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13479.719s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Direct debuttors are always notified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13481.8s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These projects appear on public agendas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13484.001s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They're reviewed in public meetings of the ZBA, the CDB, or the city council, depending on the project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13490.283s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Impact studies such as traffic impacts reviewed by police and fire safety inspections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13495.285s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These are done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13496.666s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is current practice for developers to take on the cost of their studies, which are then reviewed by city staff, including our public safety officials, boards and commissions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13505.45s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They are done on a project by project basis because that is the point of decision for the city and the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13510.552s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A traffic study done in 2024 would not be useful nation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13514.214s">[Kit Collins]</a>: useful information when in 2020, sorry, would not be useful information when, for example, in 2034, a developer might want to develop on Salem Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13523.717s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It would not be useful information for when we are negotiating with that developer for what parking and traffic mitigation they are going to do then to address the traffic patterns, congestion level, and parking needs for that development at that point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13537.16s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And finally, regarding gentrification and displacement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13541.142s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The displacement that people are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13543.942s">[Kit Collins]</a>: so afraid of and offended by and saddened by is already happening commercially and residentially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13551.586s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Refusing change is not a solution to gentrification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13554.227s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The solution to increasing housing stock, the solution is increasing housing stock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13559.85s">[Kit Collins]</a>: while expanding public housing, while growing our affordable housing trust portfolio, while considering a residential property tax exemption, while doing first-time homebuyer support, while pursuing rent stabilization, because otherwise there is no backstop in the world that will prevent out-of-town corporate landlords from cheating tenants like numbers on a spreadsheet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13579.058s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It would be wishful thinking to say that rezoning is a panacea for housing affordability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13583.94s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That is why nobody behind this rail has said that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13586.341s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is one piece of the puzzle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13589.303s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is not our only strategy for increasing affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13593.165s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And to all those who are upset that this proposal is not bullish enough on affordable housing, I would welcome your partnership with this council on any and all of those other strategies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13602.169s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, and I look forward to the discussion with my fellow councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15251.774s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15253.575s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Now for a zoning proposal that will undoubtedly garner the same level of excitement as the prior.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15262.057s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The green score proposal is a rubric for grading and essentially rewarding developers based on various requirements incentives that they meet for meeting environmental standards in their building projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15276.262s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It does this by incorporating the new green score rubric<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15278.903s">[Kit Collins]</a>: into our site plan review process, and it defines new development waivers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15284.489s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Green Score is not a grading rubric that applies to every development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15288.413s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It applies only to projects that are located in certain zones within the FEMA National Flood Hazard Layer and projects that are subject to site plan review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15297.342s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The green score zoning proposal includes and then builds upon Medford's existing environmental standards for developers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15304.706s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It goes upon these existing standards such as stormwater management and permeable surfaces or open space and permeable surfaces to include additional flexible new ways for developers to meet environmental standards that we already know we want developers to be meeting in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15322.585s">[Kit Collins]</a>: from meeting these specific and defined environmental and climate resiliency criteria.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15327.647s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Developers may receive, I'm going to say quote unquote rewards, such as development waivers or bonuses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15334.208s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These waivers or bonuses are very clearly defined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15336.569s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's not just anything, it's things that we have decided are worth trading for these specific environmental<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15345.375s">[Kit Collins]</a>: achievements that developers would probably not find it economically feasible or enticing to do otherwise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15352.504s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is our way of encouraging developers to be more climate friendly than they would be otherwise, within this defined structure of waivers and rewards that still fit our vision, vision, sorry, long night, for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15365.599s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The incentive structure is a menu of different landscape and infrastructural elements that provide options that can be tailored to different building and site conditions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15373.969s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So it's designed to be flexible to different developers' needs and what conditions are on different lots, so that there's something that every developer can take us up on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15382.618s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They might include, just for example, planted areas, different types of plantings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15387.403s">[Kit Collins]</a>: green or blue roofs, vegetated walls, permeable paving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15391.605s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And there's quite a long list if folks are interested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15393.766s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is laid out in the meeting materials that are linked on our public portal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15398.768s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And for the environmental set, you'll probably find it quite interesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15402.049s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Lastly, I just want to clarify, green score does not allow developers to exceed our existing height or story maximums.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15412.073s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, any incentives or waivers earned through green score or incentive zoning are still constrained by our total height maximums.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15420.355s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, and I also want to clarify because we get this question a lot that green score is a separate process from building energy efficiency standards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15428.217s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have already adopted the state specialized energy code, and this is different from that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15433.899s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15774.095s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, thank you for the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15775.175s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's a really thoughtful one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15778.977s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The planners may know they might have studies that accompanied their study of the municipalities where this has been rolled out before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15785.8s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would have to follow up and ask them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15787.381s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I believe they dropped off the call a couple hours ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15790.102s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We can try and get that information for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15792.043s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What I will say is that, and again, I would want to fact check myself on this, I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15799.287s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Green score is so multifactorial because essentially what it is, and I know you understand what it is we're saying, over here are a fairly long list of environmental or climate resiliency improvements that we would have developers do on a quite broad constraint, but still quite broad type of structures on a quite broad type of surfaces, not all commercial, not all residential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15824.184s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And over here, we have a series of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15827.104s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, again, quote unquote, rewards or waivers or bonuses that they might get in return.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15831.605s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Those are the reason that they're doing the increased environmental stuff over here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15837.026s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Because of the level of permutations just in that kind of framework alone, if there's a study on the economic impact overall, I'd be really curious to see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15847.409s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sure if there's one, our planners have consulted it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15850.17s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think this entire project for developers is an exercise in saying,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15857.171s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What should we do over here that will make this a net positive for us economically over here because of what we will get in return?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15863.913s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I feel like the example of this that we talk about most frequently is kind of pick any environmental criteria.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15870.675s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, we'll do a green roof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15874.057s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And in addition, you get to build one more story than you would otherwise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15877.398s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm not pulling that from the proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15878.678s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm just using kind of like round numbers such as it were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15881.179s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The developer in choosing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15885.891s">[Kit Collins]</a>: which kind of environmental add-ons can they feasibly do, do they think is worthwhile, they're doing that calculation to say what can I do to meet green score at the minimum or optimal level to meet the minimum waiver structure to try to level up for increased benefits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15905.205s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I feel pretty confident that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15910.985s">[Kit Collins]</a>: put this another way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15913.446s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Developers are interacting with the system in a way to increase their net gain in a way that also increases our net gain in terms of climate resiliency benefits that we wouldn't see otherwise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15922.969s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We can look into if there's plans that augmented in associate's study of the topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15928.93s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I don't have a clear answer for you because this could go in so many permutations of ways when it's implemented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15935.672s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, I don't have a clear answer for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=16267.3s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would motion to adopt the CDB's recommendations and approve the zoning ordinance amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=16318.688s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=16319.629s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to suspend the rules to take 25-042 out of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=16766.224s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Lazzaro beat me to the motion but I just want to say thank you so much Superintendent Cushing especially for hanging with us to present this paper so late in the evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=16775.313s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And, you know, all of these projects happening at the same time and the prioritization efforts speaks to how diligent the school's administration is about making sure that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=16787.204s">[Kit Collins]</a>: what needs to happen on what timeline is being paid attention to so closely by the school's administration to make sure that students will enjoy the upgraded buildings that they need on the timeline, that they need to not be impacted by a building problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=16800.151s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just thank you so much for your work and excited to get to vote on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=1817.893s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Paris.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=1821.437s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's exciting to get to this phase in the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=1824.059s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just want to begin by thanking the community for advocating for a new charter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=1827.783s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This advocacy has been going on for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=1830.165s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It predates the specific chapter in the charter review process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=1834.87s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Community members, many of whom are in the room tonight, and I'm sure watching on Zoom,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=1838.974s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=1839.174s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um have been advocating for this before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=1840.675s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There was a charter study committee assembled by the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=1843.897s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um I'm excited that I get to vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=1846.198s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes on a new charter twice in my time as a city Councilor first a couple years ago, and hopefully again in a couple weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=1855.323s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to thank the Charter Study Committee, especially Chairman Donald for all of your hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=1859.285s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The count the Collins Center for consulting with the Charter<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=1869.351s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Everybody tuning into this process knows this already, but I think it bears repeating the council's role in this process is not to draft or craft the draft charter, but to review it and to make targeted improvements and adjustments the Charter Study Committee<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=1884.58s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We know they worked really hard, diligently gathering community input, interpreting that as best as they could, creating this long and technical draft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=1893.023s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's no mean feat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=1896.264s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And now it is our responsibility, it being passed off to us at this part of the process, to have given it a thorough and earnest review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=1903.706s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Our review is not a rubber stamp.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=1905.727s">[Kit Collins]</a>: but a responsibility that we know we all, none of us take lightly to make adjustments that in our perspective, given our access, given our information, given our perspective as Councilors, to make this draft as strong as it can possibly be for the long-term good of the people that our body governs, for the good of the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=1927.275s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I believe that this draft<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=1929.316s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=1930.097s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I believe that this draft charter really does constitute a very major step forward towards a better functioning and more modernized guiding structure for our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=1938.321s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I especially want to shout out the simple fact that this charter would require a review of the charter every 10 years, which is really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=1947.546s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm so glad that the draft charter would include a review of itself for going forward, because I think that this process has illustrated how much we need that to happen on a regular cadence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=1958.037s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Tseng, I think, gave a really helpful overview of the two most substantive changes that the Council made in committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=1965.224s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do believe that these will make our governance better and stronger for the people of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=1969.988s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've said this before in our committee meetings, but I do believe that moving from an all-at-large<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=1975.733s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor system to four district Councilors, plus three at large.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=1980.277s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this is a positive change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=1981.838s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is substantially more localized representation than Medford has ever seen before in its city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=1988.123s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Guaranteeing representation from all four quadrants of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=1993.468s">[Kit Collins]</a>: while balancing against potential negatives that I do believe could come from having one Councilor from eight small wards such as uncompetitive elections and parochialism.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2005.355s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have had a really substantive back and forth about this issue in particular in these chambers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2013.82s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll speak as one Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2014.78s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's given me a lot to think about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2016.981s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2019.117s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm so grateful that the community challenged us to think really, really deeply about this issue of representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2024.28s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that we do not have consensus on this council about what the best system of localized representation will be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2034.166s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm so grateful that my belief is no matter how we go forward, Medford will enjoy more localized representation on the city council than it has before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2043.051s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that is what the residents deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2046.133s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Tseng has also outlined additional technical edits, which I do think shore up this legal document and resolve unintended ambiguities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2052.558s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's again, that's a really important part of our responsibility here on the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2056.161s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And thank you Chair Tseng for your diligence in making sure that we caught all the nitty gritty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2061.626s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I am grateful to my colleagues and all members of this process for such earnest participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=2070.533s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I second the motion from Councilor Tseng and I look forward to hearing further comment from my fellow councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3909.024s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3909.905s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate the discussion from my colleagues on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3914.389s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3920.673s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in this question of who we're talking about, not the only change we've made to the charter, but one of the changes that I think a lot of the community that's paying attention to this issue at all is most delighted to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3932.584s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I hear it being brought up a lot, what we don't know, what we can't know, what we do know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3937.748s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think some of my fellow Councilors have made the point quite well that we cannot purport to know what the community<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3949.185s">[Kit Collins]</a>: as a monolith knows or feels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3953.388s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't believe that we know what the majority of the community thinks about this particular issue specifically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3960.634s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm really grateful for the outreach that was done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3963.116s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's informed this process very meaningfully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3967.44s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm glad that we have data from the residents that were polled through the Charter Study Committee's process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3977.406s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I don't think that what we can say is that we know how the community feels about this proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3987.548s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think that anybody can say that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3989.569s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I can't say that my fellow councillors have said that they don't feel that they can make that statement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3992.469s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think that anybody can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=3993.81s">[Kit Collins]</a>: However, I think what's important for this city council, what feels important to me as a councillor is to focus on what we can know for certain<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4004.952s">[Kit Collins]</a>: which is that what residents want out of this process is a governance structure that works better than before and gets us closer to what we can know will be better for this community, which is more localized representation that seeks to balance what it seems like what we can extrapolate from the community feedback that we've gotten, which is that most people favor a mixed system, and to balance that with the research and the data statistics that we've gathered in good faith,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4031.518s">[Kit Collins]</a>: from various sources, including the Collins Center, including also supplementary studies and research from sources that are renowned and should be respected in the field and certainly shouldn't be condescended in this conversation that are enriching this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4047.124s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Our responsibility is not to take a vote that will make<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4052.771s">[Kit Collins]</a>: people closest to us happy with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4057.094s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Our responsibility is to take the votes that we think are right and best for the community long term, even if it will cost us politically short or long term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4065.679s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The responsibility is to outcomes and not popularity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4070.142s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That is why I have come down in favor of four district Councilors and five at-large Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4080.523s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I just think not exclusive to this issue, but in general, when we start talking about knowing for certain what the community as a whole feels and believes, the community feedback that we know that we have, the input that we know that we've gotten should always be considered and treated with all of the gravity and meaningfulness that it deserves and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4104.769s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it does a disservice to the outcomes when we let ourselves believe that what we have heard from the people who are most tuned in and most easy to access and most plugged in to feedback channels in the city, when we let ourselves believe that that is the whole picture, I think we do a disservice to the greater outcomes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4123.447s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And the overall point to me of reinvestigating representation in the city council<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4132.211s">[Kit Collins]</a>: is to focus the consequences of those outcomes of the people who are least engaged in these processes already, the people that we are least likely to have heard from in this process and in others, people who are least likely to be represented or that we're hearing from in any form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4146.303s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's why I think it's so important to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4150.487s">[Kit Collins]</a>: way what we know some people feel, many people feel, and to not diminish that feedback whatsoever, to not diminish it as an ingredient in this process whatsoever, but to balance it with what else we know about the consequences of these various strategies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=4166.841s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11471.251s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11471.551s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I know everybody knows how I feel about City Council composition at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11482.783s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've been pretty clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11483.563s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've been pretty clear for several meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11485.685s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm not really interested in repeating myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11487.307s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sure everybody else is even less interested in me repeating myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11493.072s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I did hear a Councilor say that nobody has articulated concerns with the three system and that is just not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11498.778s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I do want to correct the record on that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11501.32s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I won't speak for other Councilors, I know other Councilors have brought up other concerns, some of which will overlap with mine as one Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11509.567s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have brought up concerns with having one ward Councilor for each of eight small wards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11515.811s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Something I said back in January when we first talked about city council composition, my research has indicated to me that in small ward systems like ours would be, the pool of candidates would be very small.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11525.297s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also went on to say, wards do not deserve simple representation full stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11530.08s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Wards deserve compelling and competitive elections each and every time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11533.162s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's what they deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11534.483s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is still my main concern with an 8-3 system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11538.505s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just to reiterate my other concern is parochialism, I think I've never been shy that one of my two main issues on the council is housing and housing production.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11548.542s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that by having the bulk of the council being small work Councilors, there would be some very real potential harms for strategies that by necessity have to be citywide, in which the city council would have to work across district boundaries and get ahead of the tendency to be protective of one's own home base.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11566.733s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've talked about that before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11567.693s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've raised these concerns before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11568.854s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't bring that up because I want to relitigate that before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11570.995s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that people disagree with me about those concerns, but it's not accurate to say that we are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11577.77s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's not accurate to say that I have one Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11579.752s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm forwarding a strategy, having cited no concerns with another approach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11584.156s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That is just not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11585.057s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've never been shy about saying what my concerns with H3 are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11589.701s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I will accept that my fellow Councilors will disagree with me when they disagree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11592.724s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I can accept that community members will disagree with me when they disagree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11596.427s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I can fully accept that community members may not want to support me in the future if I do things that they disagree with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11601.749s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That is your right, and I accept that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11606.09s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I would not want to go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11608.491s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would not think that I would earn this seat if I was supporting an approach that I did not think was best for the community just because I think it would make me more popular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11616.213s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But what I do not accept is being prescribed a reasoning for my vote that is not my own, and I don't think it is productive to this conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11625.378s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think it's fair to the residents for us to, I don't think it is in any way additive for us to have this conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11633.522s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we can disagree, and that's great, and I think that's really important, and I'm glad we're disagreeing out in the open, but I don't think it adds anything for anybody for us to be putting words in each other's mouths about why the way we feel the way that we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11647.633s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do not want to cut off discussion if there are any other members of the public who would like to speak, but if there are not, I would move the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=626.896s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, why don't we get started?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=635.422s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There will be a meeting with the Medford City Council Planning and Permitting Committee, February 26th, 2025.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=639.964s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This meeting will take place at 6 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=643.026s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in the City Council Chamber, second floor, Medford City Hall, 85 George P. Hassett Drive, Medford MA, and via Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=649.39s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=655.514s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes, he'll be here shortly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=663.13s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, she is on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=679.735s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Leming, that was to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=681.216s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I can't hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=687.184s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Beginning to speak into the mic for the folks on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=689.806s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=695.07s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=696.191s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Four present, one running late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=699.534s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The meeting is called to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=702.132s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you all for joining tonight in person and on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=706.697s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The action and discussion item for this committee meeting is 24-033, Zoning Ordinance Updates with the Innes Associates team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=716.908s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is our fourth meeting of this committee of the year, and it's also our fourth meeting on the neighborhood and urban residential<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=723.735s">[Kit Collins]</a>: topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=724.376s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I know that Innes Associates will be walking through kind of the progression of this topic that we've seen over the past couple months in their presentation just shortly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=733.345s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But in a nutshell, this is the part of our citywide... Sorry, I'm going to turn my volume up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=740.279s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Now that I hear the fans coming on, this is the has my volume better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=745.702s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=748.604s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is the part of the city wide review of our community zoning in which we are looking at zoning and specifically residential districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=757.168s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're looking at everything from the lowest density districts in the city up to the highest density districts where we currently see the highest density for residential uses and also those areas where it makes sense to prioritize denser residential housing because of new T stations in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=776.959s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The goal of the neighborhood and urban residential zoning proposal is to look at the areas of the city that are already residential and craft a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=785.383s">[Kit Collins]</a>: updated and thoughtful proposal that responds to what is already there, what the geography and topography and characteristics dictate for what can go into each section of the city, and to create a more thoughtful gradient of housing options from the lowest density residential up to the highest density<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=802.335s">[Kit Collins]</a>: residential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=803.016s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we have been workshopping and iterating on this for the past, the three prior committee meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=810.103s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know that Paola in just a minute is going to run us through kind of how this proposal has evolved over those past three meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=816.79s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What is new tonight, in my understanding, which we talked about last or two weeks ago,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=821.976s">[Kit Collins]</a>: is that now that we have revised the district map, that bird's eye view of what residential subdistrict could go where throughout the city, we're now going to take a closer look at dimensional standards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=836.717s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we are also going to look at different options for how to protect non-conforming structures in the potential updated residential subdistricts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=846.283s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then we're also going to talk a little bit about what comes after this phase of the project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=851.246s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So with that, I will check and see if there are any Councilors who have initial questions or comments up top.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=858.01s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then I will hand it over to Ines Associates for a presentation and we can take things from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=863.298s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And as usual, we will take all public comment at the end of the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=867.88s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So bear with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=869.922s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, seeing none, happy to pass it over to Emily or Paola to walk us through our presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=1373.01s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=1373.651s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Paola, thank you for that, for the introduction to how the proposal maps have changed over the past three meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=1379.657s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just to highlight two things that I don't want to get lost in the discussion, or things that I want to clarify, you're saying that the only change for the Proposal 4 map from Proposal 3, which we looked at two weeks ago, is that the UR1, Urban Residential 1 subdistrict,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=1395.413s">[Kit Collins]</a>: now extends closer to Ball Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=1397.073s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And the colors have changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=1398.774s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That was in response to feedback that the different shades of yellow were just really hard to parse, hard for people to tell what was different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=1404.195s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So if people are seeing a new teal or green on the map, that's not a new sub-district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=1408.536s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's just a new, more contrasting color for the same sub-district as we were looking at before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=1414.297s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Did I capture the part about Ball Square sub-district correctly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=1417.358s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes, that's perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=1418.598s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=1418.818s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=1419.138s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I also just want to I forgot to say this up top.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=1422.099s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, but it's my understanding that this also has not changed from the original version of the proposal that when we're talking about these residential sub districts, the maximum by right height for all residential sub districts is three stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=1854.561s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=1857.342s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm going to recognize<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=1931.784s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go ahead, Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2207.405s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, and I see Attorney Silverstein, who's working on this project on Zoom, I'll recognize you as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2297.691s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2304.937s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for that guidance, Attorney Silverstein.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2306.339s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2307.91s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Leming, do you have more on that topic?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2310.332s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Does that satisfy your question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2526.824s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I understand we are going to get deeper into the ADU's discussion in two weeks, as Paula mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2531.326s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think that's very helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2532.987s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And thank you for the legal guidance, Attorney Silverstein.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2536.568s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think for the purposes of this proposal, we could probably put a pin in that discussion for now, but really appreciate the clarity on how it relates to the districts in this proposal where single family homes<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2551.674s">[Kit Collins]</a>: are allowed by rightness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2553.596s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't see any by special permit in this table currently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2556.718s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2832.681s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you so much for that overview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2834.702s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's exciting to see the two months of discussions distilled into a couple of organized tables.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2841.223s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for that clarity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2843.304s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know we have another section to the presentation that we're talking about tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2845.804s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Before we move on to that, are there any further questions from councillors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2850.146s">[Kit Collins]</a>: on the dimensional requirements or any of the new, we'd say new definitions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2853.729s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These are topics that we were talking about throughout this process and are also present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2856.972s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, have been present for a long time, but any questions on the definitions and dimensionals presented tonight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2864.479s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll recognize President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2886.764s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Perfectly teed up the next section of the presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3049.465s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you so much for looking at the current ordinance to see if the protections that we'd want to make sure are present under the new zoning, if those still apply to the current zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3060.129s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's great to hear that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3061.389s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It sounds like we won't have to make many, if any, further tweaks to make sure that if, should the noose of districts be approved, and this goes into effect, that people who live in existing single family homes in districts where maybe single family homes, new ones will not be allowed by right,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3078.216s">[Kit Collins]</a>: will not suffer, you know, a burdensome and onerous and inconvenient permitting process when they want to make the kind of improvements to their homes that anybody should be able to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3089.459s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great to hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3089.999s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3091.099s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any additional questions on that point, President Bears or other councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3098.642s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3100.682s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing none.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3103.143s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3106.535s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we have before us the updated draft zoning proposal for the neighborhood and urban residential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3113.421s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We ran through the zoning map that the text describes, the updated zoning map, the dimensional requirements, had a discussion about how that affects ADUs, and we know that at our next meeting in two weeks, we're gonna dive in a little bit deeper on the ADU issue, kind of a citywide approach, not specific to this proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3136.173s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we'll also hear a little bit more about development standards for multifamily buildings in that one highest density residential subdistrict, UR2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3145.504s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we have that to look forward to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3155.263s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I believe that next phase of our process will also dovetail with us starting to get a little bit deeper into a kind of shifting out of residential sub districts for the moment, talking more about a commercial framework.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3166.958s">[Kit Collins]</a>: which will guide our discussions later in the spring about the more commercial areas of the city, some additional corridors, squares.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3175.462s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know a lot of people are eager for us to talk about Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3177.904s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're working hard to make sure that that conversation dovetails with the other work, RFP, other consultant work that's been in the works around Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3186.088s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we have a lot coming up on the pipeline as folks, so on the timeline earlier in the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3194.832s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll recognize President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3235.238s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I will run through that timeline one more time before we adjourn tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3240.762s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But before we kind of give that overview and move to public comment, I wanted to ask if there are any motions on the proposal before us, any additional questions or comments from councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3253.631s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As we all know, but just to reiterate it, this is kind of the long first or second step in the zoning amendment process, depending on how you want to look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3265.118s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is our fourth meeting on this proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3268.722s">[Kit Collins]</a>: After a new zoning or zoning amendment is referred out of this committee, it is then referred by the City Council to the Community Development Board for public hearings, one or more, where there may be more public comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3280.051s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are working with the zoning consultant and city staff to make sure that we host another public Q&A session for this proposal before the CBP public hearing or hearings on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3289.724s">[Kit Collins]</a>: like we did for the Salem Street corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3291.385s">[Kit Collins]</a>: After review by the CDB and it puts forward its recommendations, it will then come back to the city council for another public meeting where we will take a vote on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3300.992s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's again, just to like to say it at least once every meeting is the process that all zoning has to go through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3305.455s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know there's a lot of moving parts, but we really do hope that everybody participates in as many pieces of that process as they can and want to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3345.989s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3355.218s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3374.359s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3374.799s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing no further comments or questions from councilors, we'll go now to public participation on this proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3381.502s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I will alternate between the podium and Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3385.783s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Everybody will have three minutes to state comments or ask questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3390.105s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If there are questions, you can then bundle them and have the zoning consultants or city staff or councilors respond to them at the end of all public comment as appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3401.238s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, I'll start on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3404.221s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please, and you have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3429.405s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3429.785s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They're available on Civiclerk right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3431.905s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll put the link in the chat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3433.626s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3440.867s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have the floor if you have any other questions for us tonight, Zachary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3445.688s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3446.248s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3446.528s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3455.31s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, thanks for moving that, Paolo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3459.727s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, Gaston, please go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3461.589s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3483.567s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3484.007s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3603.903s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for your questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3607.847s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Right, we'll go back to Zachary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3610.029s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's a new hand and not an old hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3648.004s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3648.444s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, we had the public q&a.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3650.885s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well, just to state up top the we've been updating the timelines as we've been going along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3657.227s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So if you're referring to a timeline from a past meeting packet, it's probably not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3666.766s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3667.266s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3668.487s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Our intent with the public Q and A's is for that to kind of be slotted in between the city council committee creation of the proposal before the CDB holds public hearings on it to create an additional chance for public comment before it's referred out of the CDB and back to the city council for a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3686.16s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So an opportunity for comment for Q and A is before the zoning proposal is referred back to the city council for a vote to ordain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3720.171s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's the public Q&A is not, it is not a function of the CD board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3724.253s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm gonna go to President Bears to respond to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3800.8s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I recognize Director Hunt at the microphone as well, then we'll go back to you, Zachary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3885.548s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3885.849s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for the clarifying question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3889.872s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I see no further hands raised on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3893.115s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Please go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3894.316s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then we'll go back to Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=3895.357s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just your name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=4153.337s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for your questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=4203.961s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Please go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=4763.661s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=4764.001s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for your questions, Judith.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=4765.202s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=4765.982s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that is clarifying for a lot of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=4767.823s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And of course, if you have further questions, anybody in the chambers or online, please do feel free to forward them to the planning staff or myself, and we will make sure that they get to the right person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=4779.649s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm going to recognize Councilor Scarpelli, and then we have some folks who haven't spoken yet on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=4783.751s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go ahead, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=4790.526s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=4798.273s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, we can hear you now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=4799.093s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=5123.898s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpellile.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=5523.185s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bearson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=5524.685s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Judith, for kicking off a thoughtful discussion and to Councilor Scarpelli for weighing in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=5531.528s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have a number of people on Zoom that have been waiting, so if you don't mind, I'm going to hop to that queue and then we'll come right back to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=5538.271s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I saw Janie's hand first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=5540.272s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Janie, I'm going to unmute you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=5541.332s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Please name and address for the record, and you have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=5800.042s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, appreciate you bringing that up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=5801.282s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are going to begin talking about that's going to be a part of the next phase, the next chapter of the zoning overhaul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=5809.406s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're going to begin talking about the commercial framework broadly in March, and we're not going to be diving straight into a new proposal for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=5818.449s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Boston have the Boston have district we are very much going to be looking at an institutional zone for Tufts University made making sure to prioritize discussions with the residents to form the basis of that we don't have a I don't want to advertise a specific committee day we're going to be talking about Boston have yet just because we're still putting together that timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=5835.999s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and we're going to be just making sure that we're scheduling meetings for the community really thoughtfully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=5844.304s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we will be putting out a more specific calendar when those dates become available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=5851.109s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think between March and April, those will be coming up, but if you're not seeing the dates right now, it's just because they aren't on the website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=5856.592s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm gonna go to President Bears, I see you have a comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=5931.996s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's also likely but not confirmed just now and we'll be sure to, I'm sure that at our first meeting about the commercial framework<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=5938.8s">[Kit Collins]</a>: on March 12th, if I'm remembering that correctly, we will be able to present a more specific timeline for meetings under that category, which will include Austin Ave as well as other corridors such as Main Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=5952.347s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you for that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=5986.379s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes, of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=5987.18s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for the more specific answer than I was offering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=5991.684s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for your comments, Janie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=5993.646s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I just do want to acknowledge the point that you're making about affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=5996.448s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I really appreciate you bringing that into this discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=5999.391s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We had a long discussion about that two weeks ago in this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=6005.156s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's certainly on the forefront of all of our minds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=6007.158s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's a value that we share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=6009.12s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are trying to make sure that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=6011.722s">[Kit Collins]</a>: this zoning, our updated zoning, encourages and incentivizes affordable housing wherever possible and where that is not possible within the confines of what zoning can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=6021.75s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The City Council, in collaboration with many City Hall departments, is working very hard on other parts, on other affordable housing strategies, such as supporting our affordable housing trust fund, a brand new community land trust,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=6038.642s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and other, for example, we were able to put online affordable housing incentives for veteran renters this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=6045.565s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It takes a lot to deal with this very, very gargantuan regional issue of housing unaffordability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=6053.088s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're trying to do that in zoning where we can, where we can't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=6055.269s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's a lot of other strategies that we're collaborating on, and thank you for making sure that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=6059.951s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're keeping this up for this discussion and others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=6063.532s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll go back to podium, and then we'll go to folks who have hands raised on Zoom, prioritizing folks who haven't spoken yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=6070.374s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=6071.814s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=6341.589s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, William.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=6343.37s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll go next to Cheryl on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=6346.152s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=6347.472s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=6355.157s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go ahead, Cheryl.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=6355.917s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm asking you to unmute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=6361.198s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Am I unmuted?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=6362.799s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Now you're good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=6363.46s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=6364.141s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=6490.783s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for your comment, Cheryl.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=6493.185s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=6493.946s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are going to continue on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=6497.368s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Then we'll go back to folks who have spoken already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=6500.03s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Maryann, I'm going to ask you to unmute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=6501.752s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=6503.233s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=6508.117s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There you go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=6509.898s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=6824.179s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for your comments, Mary Ann.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=6827.912s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, we will return to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=6830.254s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And for folks who have spoken already, we'll just request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=6834.559s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's only folks who have already spoke left, so we'll alternate back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=6837.522s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And for folks who have already spoke, if you could try to limit your comments to just a minute or two, that'd be appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=6841.586s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=7239.533s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, I see one more hand raised on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=7248.856s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Zachary, I'll unmute you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=7249.677s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If you could keep your follow-up comments to just a moment or two, that'd be appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=7252.638s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Please go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=7391.58s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=7397.147s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Zachary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=7397.788s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Appreciate that comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=7400.334s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If I'm apprehending your question correctly and I see Emily approaching the podium, I think for folks looking to get that kind of source material for where is the vision for this coming from, the land use map that Paola referenced up top at the start of the presentation from the comprehensive plan I look to is kind of the source image for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=7422.293s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Why are we looking to do what we're looking to do where?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=7425.716s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's drawn on, as we know, looking at current features of the community, social, demographic, natural, architectural, et cetera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=7433.763s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Looking at existing trends, looking at what can occur where.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=7438.748s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sure that you've looked at it already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=7439.869s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's the best single source for how all of this comes together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=7444.112s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that that does shed light on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=7447.655s">[Kit Collins]</a>: both why the current density is where it is and why what we're trending towards is what it is as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=7477.741s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It might also be that there are different opinions about where density should occur.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=7481.143s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that on our approach, there are many factors guiding where we think lower density is appropriate and where we think higher density is appropriate, but concentrating around major institutions, our best sources of transit and existing density is kind of the North Star for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=7500.716s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I do wanna recognize Emily from Menace Associates who's approached the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=7746.269s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I are there seconds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=7749.83s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll recognize you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=7751.291s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Emily, for that presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=7752.651s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Really appreciate you bringing us back to the context.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=7756.613s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Zachary, please go ahead for another minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=7770.379s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Those are publicly available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=7771.379s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm seeing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=7775.221s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll go next to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=7879.211s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll go to Eric on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=7913.35s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, I see no further hands on Zoom for the moment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=7916.212s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any additional public comment in the chambers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=7991.088s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm not aware of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=8274.342s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to keep our conversation to the topics that were noticed for this community meeting at the City Council meeting last night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=8280.387s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We were talking about an MWA bond for replacing lead servicemen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=8293.098s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're veering into a separate issue here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=8313.264s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Now it exists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=8314.004s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's in the capital stabilization fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=8705.707s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Paris.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=8708.508s">[Kit Collins]</a>: one of the many issues on which localities, municipalities are left fighting for scraps to try to feed a vast array of critical needs and constituent services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=8721.518s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll recognize Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=8880.548s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=8880.968s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we currently have on the table a motion from prior to public comment from President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=8903.651s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's a motion to refer this draft of the neighborhood and urban residential zoning proposal to a regular meeting and to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=8910.738s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just to reiterate one more time, this draft is being referred to the City Council for regular meeting where procedurally will be immediately referred to the Community Development Board<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=8919.806s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to begin the public hearings process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=8923.489s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And those will be noticed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=8924.67s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are also working to schedule a public Q and A, which is separate from the public hearing process, just an addition onto it and an opportunity for additional public comment that we will work to schedule for some time before the CD board starts its public hearing on this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=8940.281s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then the public hearing will continue in the city council when it's referred back from the CD board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=8948.735s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On the motion by President Bears to refer to City Council and adjourn, seconded by Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=8956.558s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=8968.483s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It looks like she dropped off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=8970.024s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli did as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=8971.104s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=8974.285s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=8978.941s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=8980.263s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Three in favor, two absent, the motion passes and the meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=8984.13s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you all so much for being here and for your participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=844.946s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for putting this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=846.147s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to send deepest sympathies to Ruth's family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=850.068s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I feel very lucky to have gotten to meet her several times over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=855.47s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=855.89s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Always a constant fixture at West Bedford Open Studios and other art events around the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=864.593s">[Kit Collins]</a>: always nice as you know, somebody who always goes to that events always able to count on seeing Ruth and saying hello and checking with her and seeing a smile and saying what she had made recently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=874.26s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know she meant a lot to the artist community in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=878.063s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know she just meant a lot to everybody who knew her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=879.924s">[Kit Collins]</a>: She was a really sweet person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=881.025s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I feel very lucky to have gotten to meet her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=883.287s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And again, you know, our deepest consolances to the family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1497.812s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1498.632s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This was our third meeting with the zoning consultant on the topic of the neighborhood and urban residential zoning proposal specifically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1507.558s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The fourth one is tomorrow at 6pm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1510.94s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We hope that residents will continue to join in this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1513.321s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1753.702s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears, for the overview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=1755.284s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would motion to refer to the Community Development Board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3740.766s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3741.767s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Really appreciate the big picture, the granular information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3746.892s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for all this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3749.435s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just want to go back to one clarifying question that I had from your presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3752.437s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And sorry, I'm sure that you made this very clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3755.24s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm just trying to keep track of the numbers you mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3759.304s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For example, there's a certain thousand number of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3762.48s">[Kit Collins]</a>: lines that are classified as copper, for example, and you said of that number of lines, there's a percentage that we know to be, that gave me the impression that even the lines that already have a classification, we're going back and double checking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3774.912s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is that the case?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3785.693s">[Kit Collins]</a>: OK, so it sounds like the trends are things that we think to be copper, broadly are copper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3791.459s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Things we think to be lead, broadly are lead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3793.481s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then it sounded like, and correct me if I misheard you, that most of the unknowns are turning out not to be lead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3798.686s">[Kit Collins]</a>: OK, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=3799.466s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanted to make sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4287.749s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4288.63s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is something that has come up in a lot of recent discussions in the community lately, including but not limited to city council meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4298.777s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Such a measure if communities like Medford were allowed to institute mandatory institutional master plans would give us<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4308.224s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the greater latitude and authority that I think we all know that we need and deserve over the very large institutions that take up a lot of real estate and take a lot of land and footprint within our communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4322.314s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think a lot of people can recognize by gut instinct that a community should be able to have some level of mandatory at least conversation and co-planning with institutions that have such a large footprint in their communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4335.924s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Currently we are very disenfranchised and being able to enforce that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4340.547s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This legislation around institutional master plans which is something we're not currently enabled to do this home repetition would be asking for the permission to set up that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4349.088s">[Kit Collins]</a>: mandate that regulation would allow us to equalize the playing field with community partners such as Tufts University, other very large institutions, so that we can do a better job of collaborating or do the collaboration that we've been wanting to do all along on these issues that affect both the institutions and the communities like ours that host them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ve1E4R1vH68&t=4367.337s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2276.12s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2276.48s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm just so glad we're having this discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2280.222s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think a lot has already been said about the point that I was kind of the thread that I was going to pick up next, which is, you know, I feel like the parents and the advocates in this discussion have described very, very clearly what success looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2294.948s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we are really far way away from that because what you're talking about is a fully accessible community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2300.572s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The fun stuff, the programming for youth, and the boring stuff and the stuff you have to do and the stuff that everybody has to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2307.776s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, the events, the job pipeline, meetings like this, as well as the festivals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2314.88s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we know how far we are from being able to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2318.558s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We know how far we are in terms of capacity and people who are able to in the scope of their work in the city be laser focused on making sure that we start filling every one of those many, many, many gaps where we're not thinking about accessibility in all of these spaces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2334.709s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I feel like our discussion is going in the right place and that we're thinking about what solutions can we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2340.172s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On board for families and youth and all people quickly like what solutions, can we work on this year and this budget cycle to start things getting better and I think it's so important to make sure that we're.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2353.877s">[Kit Collins]</a>: when we're talking about a staff person or in how we're just framing this conversation overall to make sure that we don't lose sight of what you all know that real success looks like, because that has to be the yardstick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2365.384s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And if the yardstick for that is there's somebody central to the city's organizational chart that is holding every department and every venue accountable, even private spaces accountable to feeling fully accessible,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2381.072s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that needs to be protected position and we need to build to a place where we can have somebody who's going to ensure that that's the case in all departments and all spaces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2388.318s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's liaison for public businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2390.459s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so I agree with everything that's been said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2393.121s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that we're thinking about this in the right way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2394.522s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that we makes a lot of sense to be thinking about this in terms of short term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2398.485s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What can we do this year and what has to happen this year to kind of start that larger snowball in motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2404.59s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Like what position do we need to get into the organizational chart this year that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2410.57s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in five years is going to be a team of three and five years after that is going to be a team of 10.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2416.274s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I wish that we, you know, obviously we would all like that in three months, we'd be achieving these goals because this is stuff that people deserve already and have deserved already and we know that that would be naive to say that that is possible because we have such a long way to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2431.364s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I do think that part of this process needs to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2434.846s">[Kit Collins]</a>: some role or some type of project that is around kind of like an instant a, uh, a master plan for accessibility in the city, and I'd love to see that, um, not rolled into the boots on the ground implementation role that you're speaking about, because that's different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2448.214s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, but I think that that has to be a protected mission statement in one of these roles as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2454.217s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=1614.647s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=1659.952s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=6249.577s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll hold for now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=6250.257s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7275.758s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you chair saying I just wanted to note that pending the vote to remove the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7283.343s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mayor as by necessity, the chair of the school committee, we might also want to and i'm happy to make this in a for promotion, we might also want to accept the suggested change to add chair to the list of positions to be selected by the school committee members, as that would then have to be the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11132.674s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Chair Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11133.735s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I really appreciate this discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11136.437s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate that this motion came out of a place of wanting to have us ever be improving avenues for participation in our city bodies, and I certainly appreciate the clarified conversation that we're having with the Collins Center about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11155.273s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I am going to make a motion to strike this section, and I'll explain why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11158.596s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think what's important<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11161.918s">[Kit Collins]</a>: whether it's in our council rules or in the charter or in the school committee rules, though I cannot speak to those, is... I think what's important is improving participation meaningfully and balancing that meaningful participation with guarding the council against opportunities to filibuster, because having a democratic process for the city council and other elected bodies has to mean also letting the council be a workplace so that councilors can do the work that they were democratically elected<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11190.015s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11191.437s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think the really critical context here is that this would not be the creation of a new sole opportunity for public participation, opportunity to be heard in front of the City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11201.546s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Opportunities for public participation do exist on our bodies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11205.69s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On the City Council, with a particularly low barrier to entry, we do have more lenient public participation policies than most councils in the state, is my understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11214.458s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And sometimes the council takes rapid and direct action on matters that are brought up during public participation, and sometimes it doesn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11221.1s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think that as a representative democracy and not as a direct democracy, that is just how it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11228.702s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And my litmus test for this section is, does this meaningfully expand public participation more than what we already have to offer residents?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11238.665s">[Kit Collins]</a>: without having that adverse side effect of limiting the council's ability to do the work that we are elected to do, and I'm not sure that it would.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11245.31s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that it would be more encumbering than it would meaningfully expand participation, especially given that Articles 8.3 and 8.4 are still on the table, and those are much more specific, much more constrained, and I think a more actionable way to do what this section is getting at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11261.119s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that's my rationale, and I am making the motion to strike this section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11264.962s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11282.805s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I can repeat if needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11299.072s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just in the meantime- They're saying, should I repeat myself?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11308.138s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11308.438s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11311.832s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think what's important is improving participation meaningfully and balancing participation with guarding against the council against opportunities to filibuster.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11320.819s">[Kit Collins]</a>: To me, having a democratic process for the city council has to mean also letting the council be a workplace so that the councillors can do the work that we were democratically elected to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11332.648s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think what's important context here is that opportunities for public participation already exist on this council with, or in our elected bodies, especially on the council with a very low barrier to entry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11344.497s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On the city council we have more lenient public participation policies than most councils in the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11349.681s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sometimes the council takes rapid and direct action on matters that are brought up during public participation and sometimes it doesn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11356.587s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But as a representative democracy and not a direct democracy, that is just the case, that is how it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11363.471s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My litmus test for this section is, will this be more expanding of avenues for public participation, meaningful participation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11370.935s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Then it will<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11372.976s">[Kit Collins]</a>: then it will limit our ability to do our jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11375.718s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I believe that this will be more encumbering than it will meaningfully expand public participation, especially given that Articles 8-3 and 8-4 are still on the table, and I think that they are more specific and more actionable in a good way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11388.066s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that is my rationale for the motion to strike Article 8-1.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=14035.338s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I will withdraw.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=14037.279s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=19626.722s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Chair Tsang.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=19629.265s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate these proposals put forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=19631.947s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I am generally supportive of the proposal put forward by President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=19637.053s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have talked not a lot, but more than usual, about compensation for elected officials over the past, I'd say, term and a half than I think we usually do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=19646.282s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that this is something that electeds do not like talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=19649.785s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this is something that the public does not like us talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=19652.246s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that we have more important work to do than talk about how elected officials should be compensated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=19658.011s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it goes without saying that a lot of electeds find it distasteful to have to talk about how much people in our roles are to be compensated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=19668.698s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that many members of the public find it distasteful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=19671.58s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If this is not done consistently by ordinance or by charter, then it is something that we have to talk about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=19679.003s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For myself as one Councilor, I would feel much more comfortable if this was dictated by charter, not up to me or anybody else to vote on the compensation of myself or any other elected official while we're in office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=19692.029s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that this would be a huge asset and that it would take it<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=19695.47s">[Kit Collins]</a>: out of our hands, it would not affect elected officials while they are currently in their current term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=19700.394s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that this sets a new fair standard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=19703.457s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And most importantly, it regularizes it, it takes us out of something that sitting electeds have to vote on that would affect other sitting electeds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=19711.904s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and I would also be supportive of the, if it were to go forward, I would be supportive of the proposed amendment or, you know, amendment to the proposal put forward by President Bears, inspired by Councilor Scarpelli's comments about, you know, how we are, we're always conscious of other outstanding compensation contracts in the city at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=19731.709s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=787.842s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I'm just getting oriented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=789.183s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, we have three, four, and six.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=796.548s">[Kit Collins]</a>: OK, I can never remember who's who.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=798.869s">[Kit Collins]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=799.009s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=814.56s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, we'll get started now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=820.409s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There will be a meeting of the Medford City Council Planning and Permanent Committee, February 12th, 2025.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=825.693s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This meeting will take place at 6 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=827.274s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in the City Council Chamber, second floor, Medford City Hall, 85 Dorchby House Drive, Medford MA and via Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=832.817s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=853.004s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=853.986s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Five present, none absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=855.589s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The meeting is called to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=857.703s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Would you make sure that there's a co-host, please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=859.323s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=860.484s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=860.964s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry about that, George.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=865.845s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The action discussion item for this committee meeting is, as usual, paper 24-033, zoning ordinance updates with the Innes Associates team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=877.048s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is our third committee meeting on the neighborhood and urban residential<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=882.429s">[Kit Collins]</a>: topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=883.41s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We were introduced to this topic on January 15th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=886.831s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We got our first look at kind of a jumping off point proposal, um, around new categories for the residential areas of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=896.675s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We had some first impressions, questions, suggestions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=899.456s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Two weeks ago, we saw an updated draft from our zoning consultant and associates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=906.94s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Some of the boundaries had moved around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=908.48s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We were able to get a little bit more in depth<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=910.782s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On the differences between the various sub districts and Councilors also made a number of requests suggestions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=917.85s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On places where the boundaries between the various sub districts should move around to better accommodate the topography the geography, the types of residential types that are already existing in the various neighborhoods around Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=929.463s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So tonight being our third meeting on this topic, we have another amended proposal in front of us that I understand incorporates all of the questions and requests that were made over the past couple meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=940.855s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're seeing for the first time kind of more specificity on the urban residential sub-districts under this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=947.963s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just to quickly recap,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=950.005s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the neighborhood residential sub districts and the urban residential sub districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=954.827s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These propose five new ways of categorizing existing residential districts throughout the community, creating a more modernized and more thoughtful gradient from our lowest density areas, residential areas of the city, up to our highest density residential areas of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=973.913s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And this is informed by, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=976.755s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Topography, geography, what the land allows, what the streets allow, the types of houses and homes that are already built around the community, and proximity to things that encourage greater density, such as transit, places where there are many jobs concentrated together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=993.486s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I understand that tonight we have a couple, a number of new diagrams to look at and respond to, new proposals for boundaries between the various neighborhood residential sub-districts and urban residential sub-districts, as well as a new map that superimposes the new sub-districts on top of existing residential types in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1012.901s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think this is reflecting some of the requests that councilors made<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1016.123s">[Kit Collins]</a>: two weeks ago asking for some areas that were, for example, Neighborhood Residential 2 to become Neighborhood Residential 1 again to reflect existing neighborhood character suggestions of that nature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1027.014s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So unless there are any initial comments from city staff or Councilors, I'll first turn it over to NS Associates for a presentation as usual, and then we can discuss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1041.751s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, seeing none, I will turn it over to NS Associates whenever you are ready.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1859.811s">[Kit Collins]</a>: great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1860.391s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for that overview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1861.752s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, we'll go first to questions and comments from Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1869.678s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I see Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1871.419s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1937.52s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you so much, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1939.401s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And yes, I see that Councilor Leming shared meeting files through the City Council's public portal in the chat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1945.965s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for doing that, Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1972.601s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1973.062s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We will double check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1978.277s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1978.778s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1979.158s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We will double check that it's possible that the wrong files were updated to the public portal for today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1983.743s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My apologies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1984.363s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll make sure that they are updated ASAP after the meeting and they will match what's on the screen so that folks can, you know, zoom in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1991.49s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1993.252s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Investigate them on their own time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1994.693s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=1995.835s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'll go to NS Associates for a direct response related to the colors on the maps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2045.855s">[Kit Collins]</a>: great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2046.175s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Scarpellian.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2046.936s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2047.456s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We want to make sure that the maps are easy to read, so we'll work together to find a solution on that so that the colors are easily differentiatable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2057.622s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And on the other note about wanting these proposals to be easily legible for residents, whether they're tuning into these meetings or catching up after the fact, we had a great discussion about this last night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2070.57s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2071.571s">[Kit Collins]</a>: working really hard to overhaul, you know, or to onboard a couple new tools, including a pretty major overhaul to the city's zoning website, which will have kind of the very, very short elevator pitch version of all of these proposals, so that folks can get oriented to what we're talking about ahead of these meetings and just have an easier on ramp to discussing this work in progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2094.304s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go next to President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2528.409s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2529.03s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll go next to Councilor Leung.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2751.607s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2754.449s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Leming for those suggestions and President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2761.898s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you again for updating this proposal with a lot of our questions and suggestions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2767.662s">[Kit Collins]</a>: From the past couple meetings really glad to see that a couple of the couple of the areas that really jumped out at a lot of Councilors like in West Medford has been, I think, I think we came to consensus so that'd be more appropriate at our lowest level of density great to see that reassigned and we had a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2784.893s">[Kit Collins]</a>: very robust discussion around Lawrence Estates and the border of Forest Avenue last time, so thank you for making those adjustments as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2794.237s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Now that the urban residential subdistricts have entered the frame, I had just another kind of one more<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2804.027s">[Kit Collins]</a>: relatively minor in the grand scheme of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2806.288s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As far as the map goes, question that I was hoping to get your assessment on either now or something to peruse before our next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2813.851s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Looking at the transit proximate zone around Magoon Square in South Medford, there's an urban residential one subdistrict right around the T stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2826.076s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's abutted by neighborhood residential three on a lot of sides, actually on all sides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2830.217s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's abutted by neighborhood residential three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2833.718s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think the urban residential one sub district is appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2837.519s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's reflective of, you know, obviously, as is the case with the rest of the map, that's reflective of the type of housing that's already there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2844.061s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My question is for the kind of corridor of neighborhood residential three that travels down Main Street to where it intersects with Broadway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2854.45s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would be curious for your assessment on recategorizing that as urban residential one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2858.991s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In my assessment, that is pretty similar to a lot of the existing residential types and topography that we see in the sub-district that is labeled residential, urban residential one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2870.934s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think equally as importantly, it's one of the areas in the city that is actually really well served by bus lines, a couple of bus lines that go straight down to Sullivan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2879.355s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think there's a lot of transit users that live right around there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2882.836s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I wonder if that could be upgraded to urban residential one to reflect that and then have it grade down into neighborhood residential three in keeping with the current proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2901.677s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm hard to hear over the fan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2902.878s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, weird.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2910.33s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Can you hear me better now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2911.092s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I can repeat myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2939.39s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Absolutely, yes, sorry about that the air conditioning in this room is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2944.365s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, famously louder than I am.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2947.567s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, the area that I'm talking about is the, uh, in South Medford, along the Main Street corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2954.932s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, you have the Urban Residential 1 subdistrict that's in the Magoon Square T-stop radius, and then southeast of that, on either side of Main Street, we have Neighborhood Residential 3.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2968.04s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My observation is that I think an existing residential type that's really similar to what we see in Urban Residential 1<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2974.384s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and it's very well served by a couple of bus lines that go straight down Broadway to Somerville, sorry, Sullivan Station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2981.228s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'd like to see that assessed for if it would make sense to upgrade it to UR1.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2994.837s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're happy to reassess that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2996.078s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for clarifying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2997.779s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2998.219s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2998.599s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Also just repeating myself for the benefit of those on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3001.181s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3004.898s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Going next to President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3455.747s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you, President Bears, I appreciate that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3460.81s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Do I see any additional comments or questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3465.852s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3500.227s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One second while we find the right file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3719.648s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=3720.248s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll go to President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4077.059s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you for the discussion on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4086.145s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, hang on one second Councilor Kelly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4157.326s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think the question just to paraphrase is, we want to make sure that a non conforming single family home could still build an ADU.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4166.815s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Or I'm paraphrasing your question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4426.643s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4429.516s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this is a useful rabbit hole to be going on now as we're talking about, you know, other areas on the residential map, where we want to at least be looking at options for language for non conforming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4442.86s">[Kit Collins]</a>: striking that right balance in between zoning these districts, such as that we are not including any things that are greater gifts to developers than they are to the community and residents, especially close to transit, but are also not creating unnecessary hurdles for folks who are living in what may become non-conforming structures in some of these recategorized residential sub-districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4468.939s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go to Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4756.151s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4757.272s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go to President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4863.717s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Anything additional on this, or were you just passing the mic back?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4866.999s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, great, just checking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4872.021s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4872.962s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this has been a productive discussion on some of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4877.736s">[Kit Collins]</a>: some of the accessory topics that residential zoning gets into pretty quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4883.838s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4885.058s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Lots of little threads to run down for next time, especially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4887.379s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this is good timing as we start to get into the dimensionals, which we're going to be talking about next time, which will be our fourth meeting on the topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4893.781s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A good time to circle back to more of these topics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4897.503s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Pell and Emily, was there another piece of the presentation that we should get to before, or did I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5107.914s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5108.535s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this is really exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5110.196s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm really happy that this is being looked at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5111.898s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that there are, certainly for myself, there are a lot of areas in the city where, you know, I have a very beloved, probably nonconforming use in my neighborhood, Collette Bakery, and a lot of times that I've been talking about this with city staff or just been walking down the road and thought, wow, what if this was the jumping off point for more little uses like this to be, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5133.777s">[Kit Collins]</a>: useful to residents to bring people into the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5135.839s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think this is a really great jumping off point for looking at ways to make little, little conforming sub districts within the fabric of our residential districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5145.747s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's the type of thing that residents have been asking us to look into.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5149.27s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll go to President Bears and then Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5636.757s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5637.338s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5830.957s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll have those recirculated after the meeting and uploaded to the file for this meeting as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5835.26s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5835.52s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5837.781s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, they're there as of this meeting on the 7th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5874.778s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, I'm not surprised to see so much excitement around this agenda item of looking at the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5883.974s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in-district commercial nodes specifically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5885.915s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this is something that a lot of residents have thought about or wondered about and asked for over the years, maybe using different language, but having walkable community hubs, places to get groceries, places to gather, places to get a bite to eat in a scale that's appropriate to residential neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5904.603s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We see so many of those all around Medford, you know, from North Medford down to South Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5909.346s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and excited this process will reflect and give us some options for how to amplify that further.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5917.971s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we've had a quite a robust discussion tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5921.093s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think talking about the sub districts that we've been workshopping for a couple of meetings now and getting a little bit more into the weeds on urban residential one and two Councilors throughout several ideas for areas where we'd like to continue to see those boundaries reassessed in either direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5940.583s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we've talked about some of the areas we've already changed the boundaries a little bit with neighborhood residential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5947.927s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and seeing how those are playing out on the map.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5949.908s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just to kind of briefly summarize here, we've also talked about how some of the corridors that are conspicuously absent from the neighborhood residential zoning map are because those will be considered later in the citywide process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5962.036s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But at the same time, as we continue to move topic by topic, if, for example, there's something that we're thinking of discussing during a corridor discussion, that it then becomes very clear it should be a part of the abutting neighborhood zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5975.023s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that change will happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5976.684s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We can do that kind of back and forth to make sure that things end up in the right place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5983.386s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We talked about ADUs, which we have before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5986.727s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Those are kind of a topic that is inside of the subdistrict process and also outside of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5991.909s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that there's a lot of work being done to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=5996.828s">[Kit Collins]</a>: make sure that those are as allowed as we want them to be in the various sub-districts with the various by right conditions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6005.273s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The next step in the neighborhood and urban residential process, I know we can expect from the zoning consultant a continually updated zoning map for our meeting in two weeks that reflects more of the requests for changes that we've made at this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6019.022s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we're also gonna start talking in more specificity about dimensional requirements for each of these five sub-districts<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6026.686s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is it reasonable to expect that we can also talk a little bit more about one, the analysis of commercial nodes and residential districts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6039.71s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And also, sorry, I just lost my train of thought, scrolling my notes too quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6050.483s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, and the proposed language for waivers to protect, for example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6060.545s">[Kit Collins]</a>: non-conforming single-family homes in new urban residential districts so that we can start looking at options to make sure that a recategorization there doesn't send projects to the ZBA unnecessarily and shields homeowners from that kind of administrative hassle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6076.811s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is it reasonable that those could be touched on at our next meeting again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6080.553s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6095.606s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, excellent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6096.546s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We get to have an initial draft of those topics to look at and respond to in two weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6105.691s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are there any additional comments or questions from councillors at this time on any of the topics that we've discussed tonight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6115.928s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, seeing none, we'll go next to public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6120.134s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Each participant will have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6121.896s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just request that you state your name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6127.584s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll ask to unmute you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6128.505s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Judith, go ahead, just name and address for the record, please, and you have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6195.935s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're just negotiating where the microphone is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6199.157s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6206.443s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6290.166s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go to President Pierce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6397.071s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6397.791s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you very much, Judith.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6401.612s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Give me a second here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6402.532s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Do you want to speak before the remainder of public comment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6407.054s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is it a direct response?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6407.954s">[Kit Collins]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6409.021s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll go to Councilor Callahan and then back to public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6542.446s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6542.906s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Pierce?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6887.89s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you president bears and I appreciate the commenter who brought this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6892.032s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's a really important comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6893.773s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's one that as president bear said, we're continuing to consider.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6897.435s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is not a final draft of this proposal yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6899.436s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're going to continue to receive public comment about this and continue to tweak as we go along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6906.579s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just one point that I do want to underline as we're talking about like what, why are the changes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6910.601s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Why are we proposing changes and why are these the changes that we are proposing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6914.282s">[Kit Collins]</a>: First, that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6915.963s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All of the sub-districts, the new sub-districts that are being proposed in this proposal reflect to some degree housing that is already on the ground in these areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6929.911s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that and that informs why they've been categorized the way that they have been.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6933.993s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That doesn't preclude a conversation about you know what, what should the sub district, be what which type of existing residential housing should it most closely reflect that is a conversation we're going to keep having it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6944.277s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But the other thing I just want to underline from the conversation with my fellow Councilors is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6950.099s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In this sub district and others like it that are so incredible that are so proximate to the brand new these year and a half old T stations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6956.661s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These neighborhoods are going to see change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6959.362s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Whether we update the zoning or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6961.423s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And this is a really important conversation that we get to have as a community to try to exert some control over what type of change we see and how to try to maximize community benefit from that change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6971.066s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's a conversation about do we want to see change in developers kind of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6976.362s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, I would make the argument that I'm very concerned about developers maxing out lot sizes and dimensionals to build very expensive single family homes that people in Medford cannot afford to buy and live in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=6990.312s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so we can, I think that this conversation is around not will change happen or not, but what level of control, what levers do we want to use to try and exert our influence over making sure that that change is beneficial to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=7006.723s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Anyway, moving back to public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=7010.786s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll go back to Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=7011.886s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll ask you to unmute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=7013.527s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=7014.688s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You'll have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=7015.969s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Janie, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=7185.682s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, thank you so much for the question, Janie, I think we all know exactly what you're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=7191.148s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The Boston Ave corridor that isn't included on these maps will not be included as part of this proposal Boston Ave is one of the special cases in the city it's a corridor, it has all those really important kind of neighborhood specific elements that you mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=7205.244s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the Proximity to Transit, Proximity to Hillsides, Proximity to Tufts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=7208.107s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that will be considered later in the citywide zoning process so that we can give it kind of the like unique focus that it deserves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=7216.255s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'll go to President Bears and then Ennis for more on that topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=7472.051s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears will go next to Emily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=7525.037s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=7525.497s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=7528.197s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, we will continue with public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=7530.218s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I will go to the person who's been patiently standing at the podium, and then we will go back to our speakers on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=7539.082s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=7540.483s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, just click the button.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=7542.003s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll turn the mic on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=7543.524s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=7543.984s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=7545.005s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=7712.239s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=7712.659s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, William.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=7714.481s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any directed responses on that or we can go on to the next speaker?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=7741.63s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=7747.402s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, quickly to President Bears, then back to public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=7841.16s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=7842.68s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We will go next back to Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=7845.521s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Gaston, just your name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=7847.621s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8081.286s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you, Director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8082.506s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, we'll be sure to collaborate closely with the building commissioner on that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8089.008s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And as we discussed, I think for quite a long time earlier this meeting, as we're talking about recategorizing residential districts, I think that there's very shared consensus around not wanting to make your very normal, very regular renovations difficult for homeowners just because of the sub-district that they happen to be zoned in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8111.833s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And at the same time, we want to be using careful and nuanced language so that we're also closing loopholes through which developers would take advantage of our neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8122.08s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you so much for flagging that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8125.402s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8126.222s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Proceeding along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8128.304s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Cheryl, name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8129.905s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8314.11s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for your comment, Cheryl.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8315.812s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Appreciate your participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8316.993s">[Kit Collins]</a>: While I disagree with some of the characterization, I will just note that in the neighborhood and urban residential proposal, the maximum height in all the sub-districts is three stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8332.048s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And in the current Salem Street corridor district proposal, the maximum by right height is also three stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8341.08s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We will go next to Jimmy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8343.282s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll ask you to unmute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8344.222s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8345.463s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8346.064s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, Jimmy, I've asked you to unmute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8352.829s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, I'll try one more time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8368.353s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, I see your hand is still raised, but you're still muted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8372.838s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So try to go off mute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8377.182s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If you can, we'll come back to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8380.726s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just in the next couple minutes if you can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8383.008s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing no further public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8390.543s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you all so much for a very substantive conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8393.61s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilors, consultants, city staff, and residents alike.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8399.558s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We had a long and substantive conversation on the updated neighborhood and urban residential topics tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8406.624s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just to again reiterate we're going to meet on this topic again in two weeks that will be our fourth meeting on this topic, which is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8416.011s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There is a lot here we're continuing to finesse the boundaries between the various between the various sub districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8422.396s">[Kit Collins]</a>: which we will continue to do after this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8424.557s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are continuing to discuss the kind of accessory ramifications such as ADUs that go along with the various sub-districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8436.502s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've had a long discussion about the wanting to see options for the waivers we can build in for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8443.366s">[Kit Collins]</a>: housing types that might become non-conforming should the proposed zoning go forward so we can make sure that people can retain the advantages of their current housing, even if the zone is to change around them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8456.375s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And at our next meeting on the topic, among other things, among other updates to the map, we are also going to talk about dimensional requirements for the first time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8467.615s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think I see that the, I think I see that Jimmy is back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8471.699s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we're going to try for that public participation one more time and then entertain motions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8477.063s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Jimmy, if you can unmute now, just name and the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8479.866s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Hi, sorry about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8481.627s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And you have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8482.829s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8483.149s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8563.573s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for the question, Jimmy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8565.575s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for your years of investment in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8569.639s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think we're all sad to hear about another story of displacement from our community due to the regional horrible housing cost crisis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8581.271s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll go to my fellow councilors first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8583.013s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll go to Councilor Leming and then President Bears for responses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8790.236s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8790.556s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll go next to President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9194.492s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9195.233s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli, please go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9256.498s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears, is that a new hand or an old one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9301.585s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9301.946s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll go to Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9389.135s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9526.239s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Question was about housing affordability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9531.243s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it is, I'll just say, I think it is really important that when we're talking about affordability policy that we recognize that that exists in an ecosystem that also includes housing production.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9542.953s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're talking about housing production, that also that conversation also includes housing policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9548.358s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And housing policy has to include what we can do by right at the local level as a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9552.821s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it also has to include things that we're advocating for on the state and federal level, whether that is affordability protections that we are currently not allowed to do by the state and the government that we're advocating for the right to do to better protect people in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9568.793s">[Kit Collins]</a>: or advocating for better funding so that we can make the changes that our residents and our displaced residents would have liked to us to have done years ago that we have no empowerment and no resources to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9581.218s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are years into a regional housing cost crisis that has been pushing people out of Medford for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9588.121s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Every time this happens, it's a tragedy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9592.202s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do not agree that increasing housing in a reasonable and neighborhood specific way in every single neighborhood is a part of that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9601.489s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is it the same as enacting rent stabilization so that rents cannot go up astronomically and push people out in just a year's time, which is currently legal?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9608.934s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No, it's not the same of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9610.475s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's a more indirect tool, but it is a part of the ecosystem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9614.677s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I don't think that we should gloss over the nuances such as the affordable incentives in Greenscore and our building requirements that are baked into the zoning process that allow us to thoughtfully increase affordability, use the levers that we do have in this system so that our zoning, which is the only tools that we have to control what private property owners do on their private property, can also hopefully as often as possible lead to maximum community benefit, which includes more affordable units on the market.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9642.547s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9732.185s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll go to Councilor Leming, and then I will make a wrap-up point, and then I will entertain motions to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9939.898s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor, I'll go back to you and then I'll wrap up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9983.118s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli, I think we're all extremely glad and grateful that the Affordable Housing Trust is finally on the books and becoming empowered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9991.885s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=10007.256s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sounds like you remember.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=10052.218s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is there a motion to adjourn before I make a final comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=10056.483s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, I hear a motion to adjourn by Councilor Callahan seconded by Councilor Leming, before we take the roll call vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=10063.851s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just want to note.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=10069.238s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it is incumbent upon us who are elected to find solutions to problems and not just to talk about them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=10074.122s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it'd be irresponsible for any of us to say that any one strategy is a silver bullet that will solve the rapidly escalating regional housing cost crisis, and that's why nobody says that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=10086.954s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it'd be equally irresponsible to say that we should do nothing at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=10093.2s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Because no solution is perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=10095.163s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The reason that we are working on so many that many Councilors are working on so many strategies targeted afforded housing affordability is because we know that no one strategy is sufficient.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=10105.576s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=10108.62s">[Kit Collins]</a>: look forward to continuing to collaborate with as many Councilors as possible on creative solutions that can fit together to create a more affordable environment in Medford between increasing our housing stock, which we know to be necessary, to pursuing greater access to policies that will help renters stay in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=10131.295s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, this has gone on too long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=10145.001s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On the motion to adjourn by Councilor Callahan, seconded by Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=10164.565s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Five in favor, none opposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=10166.165s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1621.877s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1622.657s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanted to thank Councilor Lazzaro for putting this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1625.638s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know that Councilor Lazzaro and President Bears in particular, among other councilors, have been in very close contact with this neighborhood coalition that has been organizing in the wake of Professor Dill's untimely death.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1639.444s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you to you for that work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1642.125s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And thank you to the residents for organizing in the wake of this tragedy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1646.727s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's hard to find words for something like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1651.25s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want the residents to know that we share in your grief, and it's just so hard to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1658.835s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As residents of the city, as residents of most cities, as representatives of any city, this is something that we have to fathom because it happens all of the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1666.259s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think it's at all an exaggeration to say that roads in America are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1671.067s">[Kit Collins]</a>: paved in tragedy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1673.308s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It has incredibly normalized the level of road violence that we all have to live with and grieve from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1680.27s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And as a representative, it fills me with just disbelief and fury that municipalities like ours are so hamstrung when it comes to the level of discretion and capacity and resources that we are allowed to have because of how funding is allocated from our federal and state partners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1700.636s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and how hamstrung we are and things that we have to bottom line as a city, leaving us so disempowered to do the type of improvements that residents have been begging us to do for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1710.824s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We need substantial, radical road redesign on most roads in Medford if they are going to be livable for the people that walk on them and bike on them and roll on them and drive on them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1723.173s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And if it was possible for us to do that amid our other statutory responsibilities, I think we would have done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1729.958s">[Kit Collins]</a>: going to say, 50 years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1733.259s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And because we, for many reasons, could not, and for other reasons, would not, people continue to die.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1746.381s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so it's with this perspective that we have to go forward and use the levers that we have at our disposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1751.362s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm really, really grateful to every resident who has been calling on us to meet with our delegation and with partners at DCR as often as possible to say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1760.609s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is insane that this is normal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1762.951s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is national gaslighting that people are supposed to just get over, people dying on roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1772.76s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this is another incredibly sad example of how governments are not given the tools to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1785.48s">[Kit Collins]</a>: kind of compete with the pace of technological advancement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1790.906s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Cars are getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and faster.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1795.051s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Roads are not changing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1796.372s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Municipalities are not given more tools to address this problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1799.916s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And people keep dying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1808.16s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't really know how to wrap it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1810.161s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It just never should have happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1812.001s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we have to keep working together until it stops happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1814.862s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So again, thank you to the residents and to Professor Dill's family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=1818.143s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're very deep in sympathy for your loss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=2392.962s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I found them in order and I move for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=2416.904s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I found it in order and I moved for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=2419.726s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This was our second conversation on the neighborhood and urban residential zoning topic in planning and permitting, which we will meet on a couple more times this month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=2609.032s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=2609.672s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have a motion to continue to the March 11th meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3138.146s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3138.927s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just wanted to thank my colleague for finding a date certain for a committee meeting on this topic and also to my fellow Councilors for working so much with this community in recent weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3151.294s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is another issue that I know residents have been advocating for for a very long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3155.477s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's overdue for some attention and some funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3158.259s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I am really glad to see the urgency around this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3161.501s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3161.761s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I look forward to working with you all on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4103.528s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4105.849s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also want to yeah, thank you, Councilor Scarpelli for bringing up this topic, we talked about this so often in the planning and permitting committee and I think it's really good to have the chance to talk about this to a wider audience in a regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4117.497s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Also want to thank President Bears for facilitating at the Salem Street quarter q amp a last night and to all the elected to attended and especially to city staff and associates for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4129.504s">[Kit Collins]</a>: staying quite late to make sure that everybody's questions were answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4135.73s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Truly, truly appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4139.855s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we have, like I said, I'm really glad that we're talking about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4143.736s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate President Bears' framing that this is, you know, by no means the first topic in the zoning, the citywide zoning process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4153.058s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think as we've been going along, we've been learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4155.178s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I, well, just to speak for myself, I have been learning a lot, not only about the zoning, I have learned so much about zoning through getting, through being required to get really, really into the weeds on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4166.58s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But it has also been really critical to note what questions people have about what we started with phase one, we moved on to Mystic Ave corridor district, we moved on to Green Score.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4177.765s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Green Score is kind of now closest to finalization of the topics that haven't yet been ordained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4184.347s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And Salem Street, its next procedural step is the CDB.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4186.989s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And with each of these proposals, we learn more about what is interesting to people, what is confusing to people,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4195.632s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Do we hear from not very many residents about what do we hear from a lot of residents about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4201.515s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that gives us what I think is incredibly crucial and valuable information about how we need to be responding to those questions in our public facing communications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4214.381s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we have been trying to really, you know, just sprint as fast as we can being responsive to that, while we are continuing this process of reviewing the whole zoning citywide, I really do think it is important that we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4230.538s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, stay true to our promise to review zoning comprehensively this term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4238.421s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's not like kind of getting into any timeline specifics, but just I do think it's incredibly vital to do that as a package because with zoning, if we were to end up with kind of a incomplete overhaul, having touched some quarters, but not others, some neighborhoods, but not others, some topics, but not others, that would create a really chaotic<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4261.329s">[Kit Collins]</a>: legal landscape for developers for residents for city staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4266.153s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's just, I don't think that we run the risk of getting into that kind of situation but that is that is kind of an overarching goal guiding this process that we have to make sure that at the end of this project, the zoning, quote unquote, agrees with itself so that we avoid any<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4281.106s">[Kit Collins]</a>: legal chaos that could come from having tables of uses that don't line up or neighborhood uses that are not compatible with other neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4288.628s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Right now, we have no intention of singling out any neighborhood and we have to make sure that we proceed at a pace that allows us to stay true to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4298.111s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Anyway, back to the stuff that I honestly really love talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4324.702s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4325.182s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4325.883s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No, I appreciate you noting that of course we are associates is not an employee of the city, so we have to use them while they are available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4337.233s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think on that point, it's also important to note that our zoning consultant has already, I would say, just speaking only for myself here, quite magnanimously gone beyond the scope of what we are paying them to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4347.978s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that this work is necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4351.379s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's really valuable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4353.14s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're gonna work with them to make sure that we can continue layering more public feedback, public participation, additional opportunities for public participation beyond all of our existing public committee and public hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4365.805s">[Kit Collins]</a>: meetings that are baked into this process as a minimum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4368.507s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm really grateful to them for doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4369.967s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We want to make sure that they continue to have capacity to do public Q and A's for every zoning topic, not just Salem Street going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4377.851s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've been working with them so that they can, for all zoning topics going forward, in addition to some other comm stuff that I'll talk about in just a minute, put out really short bite-sized, like two-minute explainer videos for each zoning topic, which I think will be really, really useful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4395.12s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Because reading about zoning is incredibly dry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4397.843s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So things like that I think will add a lot to the process for residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4402.81s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But at the end of the day, we are still working with a consultant under the constraints of a contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4410.419s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that is a real constraint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4415.627s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we've talked about this a little bit in the planning and permitting committee, but I thought it was just really salient what the Councilor said about residents noting, you know, that we need to, we need really, residents need help in simplifying what changes are proposed, what is proposed to change in the corridors and the neighborhoods that we're looking at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4434.171s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You mentioned bullet points, you know, my ears pricked up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4438.532s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When I heard that because so much of what I've been working on, you know, quite intensively for the past few weeks at this point is really at the same time as we're comprehensively reviewing the city zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4449.577s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I personally have been comprehensively overhauling the city zoning website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4456.1s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And the thing is, we really need we really need bullet points we really need diagrams.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4463.731s">[Kit Collins]</a>: for myself as an individual reading a zoning proposal alone, I do not come away with it with a deep enough understanding of the zoning proposal that I can easily explain it to another person in a way that they can understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4479.48s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and residents do not have the time and the responsibility that Councilors do to do that kind of deep dive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4485.344s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I met with the mayor's communications director and communications associate actually just earlier this afternoon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4495.75s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are getting really close on an overhauled version of the zoning webpage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4500.152s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that is really built around having simplified summaries and bullet points for every single zoning proposal, the ones that are currently going on, the ones that have already been adopted so that it is completely unmissable for residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4513.056s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What is this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4514.817s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What are you talking about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4515.877s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Explain it to me like I'm in fifth grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4518.218s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When is the next meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4519.798s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What topic comes after this one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4521.879s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What does the zoning currently say?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4523.379s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What can I do by right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4524.5s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What does by right mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4526.46s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Under the proposed zoning,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4528.841s">[Kit Collins]</a>: what would change, what would be doable by right under that new scenario, what would be different, answering frequently asked questions, including diagrams, because I think those are totally essential for understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4541.386s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's a lot of things that really don't come across in text, even when the text is simplified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4546.687s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We will add those short explainer videos when they are available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4549.849s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just think it's really important that we are trying to optimize every communication strategy<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4556.991s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4559.153s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that adding in a public Q and A for each topic is such a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4562.935s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I really want to extend my thanks to Councilor Scarpelli for beating that drum for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4567.619s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm really glad that that's going to be a part of every zoning topic going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4571.481s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In addition, the short form explainer videos, in addition, a city websites that people have a spot that they can go to, which I really don't think they had before, where they can just get oriented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4582.489s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What is this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4583.63s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When are they going to talk about it next?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4585.791s">[Kit Collins]</a>: just give me a version of this that I can digest and I can understand it well enough that I can ask a question and let people know where they can go to ask a question who to email for reliable information and when the next public meeting is so that you and your neighbors can attend and get your get your questions answered and real time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4607.897s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I am really excited for us to be onboarding all of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4611.998s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And, you know, that's our responsibility to make sure that residents, it's our responsibility to pass here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4622.081s">[Kit Collins]</a>: First and foremost, I believe that it is our responsibility to update Medford zoning because residents have been asking us to do that for a very, very, very long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4630.424s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know that there are a lot of Metro residents and business owners and local developers<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4636.686s">[Kit Collins]</a>: who have been very, very frustrated for a very, very long time, seeing neighborhoods not reflect the character that residents would like them to, seeing squares and areas with a lot of great commercial potential not reach their full potential, because we have not undertaken this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4656.664s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We owe them<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4658.285s">[Kit Collins]</a>: thoughtful zoning, reasonable zoning, better zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4661.967s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I feel really, really committed to delivering on that goal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4664.629s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And at the same time, we also owe residents good, reliable information that residents can understand without becoming zoning experts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4673.634s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that has been my focus for the past month in collaboration with my fellow councilors and with city staff and with Innes Associates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4681.459s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I am really glad that last night's Q&A answered so many questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4686.001s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're going to continue doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4688.482s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All of our public meetings, the planning and permitting meetings, the CDB public hearings, the City Council regular meetings are always public and always forums where residents can ask questions and get their questions answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4701.845s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're going to continue to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4703.186s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're going to continue to use<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4705.026s">[Kit Collins]</a>: all of the communications channels that are available to us as city councilors and in collaboration with the mayor's office to do our very best at making sure that people know about this topic that is interesting to and relevant to so many residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4719.289s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And at the same time, you know, myself and all of the councilors also have a responsibility to understand the zoning as best as we can so that we can answer questions and dispel concerns and make sure that we are sources of reliable information to residents as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4737.075s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I truly could talk about this for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4738.816s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've been spending a lot of working hours on it in the past few weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4742.519s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think the bottom line for me is this project is pretty unprecedented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4748.704s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So our communication strategy around it is going to be unprecedented as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4753.308s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I am so glad that truly all of us here behind this rail have been insisting on the communications process getting better as we go along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4762.002s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm committed to making sure that as we go topic by topic, we just continue to do the best job as we can and onboard as many new tools as we have to, so that people know what's going on, know who to ask, know when to ask, know when the meetings are, and that this can be as inclusive of a project as it can be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4783.19s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4985.955s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4986.335s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate that perspective, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4991.477s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Totally agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=4992.177s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's so many residents who have, who've had, I mean, I've been just over and over shocked by how insightful and thoughtful a lot of the questions that we've had on the zoning proposals have been.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5003.342s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I understand from last night, there were several suggestions and questions that city staff indicated that they, just one suggestion to the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5013.988s">[Kit Collins]</a>: table of incentive zoning uses comes to mind that city staff is like, wow, great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5019.329s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, let's make sure to make a note of that so we can recommend an amendment around that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5026.111s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I hear you, that going into the neighborhoods is an important part of this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5030.992s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just have to disagree with the characterization that folks are not being listened to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5039.735s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I really implore any resident<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5042.402s">[Kit Collins]</a>: who is interested in this process to come to all of our public meetings, the Planning and Permanent Committee meeting, they're always public, they're always hybrid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5052.969s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The Community Development Board public hearings are always public, there's always public comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5059.793s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Some modes of involvement are accessible for some people, some are accessible for other types of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5066.698s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are working hard to make sure that the folks who<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5069.92s">[Kit Collins]</a>: are never going to go to a public meeting are still going to well, I should say, we don't even have to work hard to make sure that people who are have no interest in public meetings can be heard, because people email us all the time with their questions and their asks for clarification and their comments on the zoning and all of those are reviewed by Councilors and by city staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5095.253s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The in-person meetings, we are always collecting, notating, taking down resident feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5101.878s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's countless times that that has been incorporated, whether it was feedback that was received at a CDB public hearing or at a planning and permitting meeting or at the Q&As, which we're piloting as of last night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5116.79s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For folks who do not yet feel like they've had a chance to have their questions asked or their suggestions heard,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5124.774s">[Kit Collins]</a>: on any zoning proposals that are currently in the pipeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5127.796s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would urge you to get in touch with any Councilor to get in touch with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5133.3s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We will make sure that the relevant committee hears your comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5140.404s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That has always been a part of this process that will continue to be a part of this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5147.908s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I just want to clarify on our collaboration with our zoning consultant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5153.329s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't want there to be any confusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5154.729s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The city council runs no risk of some sort of legal ramification from straying outside the bounds of its contract within associates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5163.491s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is just that we run the risk of running out of their time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5167.192s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They are not a city employee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5170.193s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We put out an RFP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5172.455s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I work as a consultant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5173.615s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That is my day job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5174.676s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I respond to RFPs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5177.216s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A consultant responds to an RFP with a proposal, and then a contract is signed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5183.338s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We run the risk of running out of their time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5187.319s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it is really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5189.54s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't want anybody to come away with the impression that it is not really important that we fulfill our task of reviewing all of our zoning citywide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5200.865s">[Kit Collins]</a>: because to fail to follow through on that would cause problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5205.947s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It would cause problems for city staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5207.848s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It would cause problems for local developers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5209.569s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It would cause problems for businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5212.89s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This process has always been involving of resident input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5217.012s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are going to continue to do a better job each and every week of making sure that people know about these processes so that they can ask their questions and give their suggestions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5228.962s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And like President Beer said, if we don't have CDB recommendations on the Salem Street proposal on March 5, absolutely I don't think we should vote on it on March 11, I will, I will, I will support a motion to continue that public hearing if that's the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5242.987s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think it's really clear in keeping with all of this, that we make it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5247.428s">[Kit Collins]</a>: very clear and consistent for people what their next opportunity is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5250.714s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We told a lot of people last night the next opportunity is CDB on March 5th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5255.221s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let's stick with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5256.663s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If CDB needs more time, they need more time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5259.728s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's fine with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5260.809s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5304.776s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to receive and place on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=5729.661s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would motion, unless there's any objection, I would motion to take 23-412 and 24-352 from the table and receive and place on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=663.728s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=664.288s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I had what may just be a clarifying question on section 3-2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=668.61s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In subsection C, it says the mayor shall be by virtue of the office a member of every multiple member body of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=675.914s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was hoping to get a definition of what that would mean in practice from the Collins Center or representatives from the Charter Study Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=683.258s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Does that mean any board or commission?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=685.599s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The mayor may have an informal<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=688.12s">[Kit Collins]</a>: say on or vote in if he or she chooses, or does it mean truly any multi-member body, including the City Council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=694.466s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm just, I'm not, I don't really know what to glean from that term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=721.229s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And the Mayor has a voice but no vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=724.41s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A voice but no vote on any board or commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=726.79s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, great, thank you, that's very helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=1606.031s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Chair Sung.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=1607.873s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This again might be a comment or it might just be a clarifying question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=1610.856s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In section 3-6, let me check the subsection number, subsection B. It reads, the mayor may call a special meeting of the city council for any purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=1625.356s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was just hoping to understand better like how this what this maybe tracked with most from our current charter right now, there's a provision for special meetings to be called for the city council when it's necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=1636.222s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It can be done by a quorum of city Councilors or by the president of the city council, but I don't believe that we currently have it in practice for the mayor to be able to call a special meeting of the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=1645.887s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'd like to understand a little bit more about the rationale behind that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=1649.089s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I can understand if I the reasoning for it being written into the city charter that that's a new power of mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=1681.735s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=1682.256s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It makes sense is the rationale it's I think that there's going through this project, obviously, some stipulations are more major more consequential than others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=1690.984s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think some of my deliberations around the charter around which of those things are consequential that we should change and which of those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=1702.402s">[Kit Collins]</a>: are strategies that we want available to the mayor, the city council, other bodies, but don't necessarily need to be written into the charter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=1707.743s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this just strikes me as kind of a shift in the dynamic, potentially a symptom of a shifting dynamic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=1714.045s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In the past, I think that the mayor has always been able to collaborate with city leadership when there's an emergency meeting that needs to be called.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=1719.046s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Again, I don't think that this is the most important thing before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=1722.066s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But it did strike me as a change and a new power of the mayor over the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=1727.307s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So it's just something that I want to give due consideration to and think a bit more about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=2257.572s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you chair saying I appreciate you bringing that up it was something that I had highlighted in my initial read, and the last sentence as you noted and just, again, you know, doing us as, as we have to do reading this with a fine tooth comb kind of looking for areas where there could potentially be confusion, totally heard that I think with a lot of with many of the issues that we're bringing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=2278.465s">[Kit Collins]</a>: know, it's unlikely that these things would ever be issues, but you know, it is, in a way, our responsibility to look for things that could be so we can make this document as airtight as it can be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=2288.153s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I just I flagged that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=2290.074s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm glad you brought it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=2290.995s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that if there's a way to kind of maintain the purpose of this article and make sure that you know, we're not leaving a stone unturned with if there's a more straightforward way of organizing this paragraph that it doesn't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=2304.842s">[Kit Collins]</a>: there is no arbitrariness in how it could be, or there's no flexibility in how it could be read, I would be happy to consider that language at a future meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=2313.926s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Maybe it won't end up changing, but in my initial read of it, I did read this paragraph, and at the end, I was like, in what condition may the mayor declare themselves able, and how does that interplay with the city council's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=2334.602s">[Kit Collins]</a>: unanimous vote mentioned earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=2337.305s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So if there's no further clarification that's needed, that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=2340.868s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I would be interested in having this further clarified if possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=2764.906s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=2765.447s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It took me a second to find my notes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=2768.368s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Again, sorry, another clarifying question for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=2771.669s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're in Section<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=2773.115s">[Kit Collins]</a>: 5-1 yes great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=2776.098s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was just hoping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=2778.741s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If any examples could be given of the section that describes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=2784.682s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This procedure where the mayor prepares and submits to the city council plan in the city that council then holds a hearing on it and it seems like there's a vote and this is obviously I'm trying to compare this to what we're familiar with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=2797.896s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're familiar with ordinances being promulgated by the city council and petitions and papers coming from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=2803.643s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the community via the mayor's office and city administration to the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=2809.528s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm trying to figure out if this describes something different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=2812.09s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is this like, is this a mechanism by which the mayor is proposing an ordinance, a new department, like a change to administration?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=2820.957s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Like when we say that the mayor is proposing a plan to the city council and then the city council may take a vote to disapprove of that plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=2827.623s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Could you give an example of what that might be about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=3749.066s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=3749.367s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just, before we close out, I just want to thank the representatives from the Collins Center for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oTzias0WjpI&t=3752.893s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And again, thank you to the representatives from the Charter Study Committee for being with us through this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=938.793s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=940.855s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just want to extend my gratitude to Councilor Tseng for taking leadership on this project I've reviewed it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=945.859s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's even more thorough than it was last time we reviewed it in committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=948.562s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm just I'm really glad that the city council is taking it upon itself to make sure that we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=957.91s">[Kit Collins]</a>: making these protections just as airtight and as clear for our population as we possibly could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=964.612s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's unfortunate that we're having to workshop this ordinance in a moment when federal actors are taking a regressive, frankly, ahistorical, oppressive<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=981.453s">[Kit Collins]</a>: politicizing approach to matters of reproductive health and gender expression.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=986.82s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That baffles me on lots of levels, but what's important is that people in Medford, people who visit Medford, people who receive medical care in Medford, or people who give medical care at Medford<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=1000.917s">[Kit Collins]</a>: should have every protection to get what they need and do what they do and receive care and provide care, and I think it's very important that the city council affirm that reproductive health care and all its forms and gender affirming health care and all of their forms are the farthest leg from legal, they are utterly banal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=1022.055s">[Kit Collins]</a>: very pleased to see that this ordinance is so thorough and describing all of the forms of health care, to which people are entitled, and making it really clear that all city agents across all departments shall not deploy their resources or their time and service of agendas from other states or other jurisdictions that might want to waste time and energy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=1043.715s">[Kit Collins]</a>: politicizing healthcare.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=1045.276s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=1046.057s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've reviewed this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=1046.597s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's very thorough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=1047.998s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm happy to wait to pass it out of committee until we have a legal review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=1052.12s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't know that it's necessary if we do want to pass this along to the committee of the whole and just make further adjustments or tweaks there if it's necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=1060.805s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that that would also be fine, but I'll leave that to the discretion of the ordinance sponsor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=1064.967s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this is in a really good place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7kQ21iErs-Y&t=1066.708s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=74.106s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Test one, two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=74.673s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Test one, two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=448.251s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There will be a meeting of the Medford City Council Planning and Permitting Committee, January 29th, 2025.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=452.453s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This meeting will take place at 6 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=454.354s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in the City Council Chamber, second floor, Medford City Hall, 85 George B. Hess Drive, and via Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=460.378s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=473.505s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=474.525s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Four present, one absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=475.886s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The meeting is called to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=479.985s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The action discussion item for this meeting is, as usual, paper 24-033, zoning ordinance updates with the Innes Associates team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=491.154s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this is going to be kind of a multi-topic meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=496.518s">[Kit Collins]</a>: First, we're going to go over some updates to the overall zoning project timeline, and Emily from Innes Associates is going to walk us through those, as we know, as we discussed quite a bit in our last<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=509.007s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Planning and permitting committee meeting, there's been calls from Councilors on this committee as well as requests from the public to enhance our messaging strategy around this entire zoning project in order to, you know, essentially to recalibrate at this point of year to take stock of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=525.477s">[Kit Collins]</a>: how we're getting information out to the public about what's currently at what stage of the process, where current proposals are, when their next public meeting will be, in what body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=536.184s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've been working on this zoning project since around this time last year, and in that time we've learned a lot about what people need in order to feel properly informed and updated on what we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=547.27s">[Kit Collins]</a>: community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=547.851s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um so we're doing some things on the City Council side that associates is helping us out with and we're also trying to collaborate with the mayor's office as much as we can to enhance our online information and add in more public meetings so that people have more opportunities for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=560.717s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um for learning, you know, in a way that works for more community members and for Q and A as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=565.88s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So Emily will speak more to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=567.921s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um and after we run through those updates,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=576.787s">[Kit Collins]</a>: zoning proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=579.634s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and then I think we will get a little just just a short briefing on the other part of the residential proposal that we will discuss a future meeting that goes along with the neighborhood residential proposal, but that we won't be going into in depth tonight, so we'll talk more about neighborhood residential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=594.845s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We get to that part of the process, but first I'll turn it over to Emily to talk about Schedule and communications updates unless there are any initial comments or questions from my fellow Councilors or members of city staff that I see on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=611.463s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And seeing none, I'll turn it over to Emily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=613.8s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1078.782s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1079.122s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for that overview, Emily, and I do want to thank you and your whole team for your nimbleness in kind of adding in these additional enhanced communication aspects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1089.125s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mid-year, while we're still going through the work of zoning, I think that these are really important, and I hope that as many residents as possible will take advantage of these added public meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1098.168s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Before I recognize my fellow councilors, I'll just note, I did get confirmation just earlier today that that public Q&A<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1106.05s">[Kit Collins]</a>: on the Salem Street Neighborhood Corridor District will be at the Roberts on Monday, February 10th, starting at 6 30, and we will be working with the city to make sure that that information gets put out on as many communication channels as possible developed in person at the Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1121.234s">[Kit Collins]</a>: 6 30 on February 10th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1123.695s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll recognize Councilor Scarpelli and then go to President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1440.363s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for your comments, Councilor Scarpelli, I agree with a lot of what you said I think absolutely when there's not information that's legible and comprehensible and easy to find those are the conditions when confusing or misinformation can flourish and you've pointed that out so I'm glad that we are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1456.379s">[Kit Collins]</a>: At a point in the year, we're working better together to make sure that we are trying to make progress on some of those goals that we share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1462.022s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm really heartened to see that INNIS has already been working to schedule the public Q&A for the next zoning topics after this one so that we can keep building the ship ever better with this topic and then use these improved communication methods for all of the proposals going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1478.61s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I thank everybody who has been helping us think through<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1483.392s">[Kit Collins]</a>: what that has to look like, councillors and residents, both included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1487.018s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll recognize President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1676.271s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Certainly, thank you for your comments and I'm happy to go over that in brief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1680.115s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know that at our last meeting, there was specifically a motion for myself as chair to be working with the city, with the mayor's office and her communications office to make sure that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1693.305s">[Kit Collins]</a>: we're doing all we can in collaboration to make sure that more and better information is reaching people more effectively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1699.09s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So specifically, what's that looking like?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1700.852s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're working on a lot behind the scenes now, and I'm excited for some of this to go live, hopefully within a couple of weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1708.678s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One part of this that I think is really important is overhauling the zoning page on the city website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1713.883s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As a quick reminder, the city council doesn't really have direct control over any part of the city website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1719.307s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this is a collaborative project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1722.83s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Currently, I think, and this is by no means a pejorative or a criticism, but I think it is just a fact that the zoning page on the city website is very hard to navigate if you're a layperson, if you're an average resident who heard, who has a zoning question, heard about a proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1736.919s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and you Google Medford MA zoning, it's quite hard to find what you're looking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1741.182s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's not the fault of the planning department or the communications team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1744.865s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Zoning is inherently wonky and technical and detailed and confusing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1749.268s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And to President Bears' point about us being a fairly under-resourced city, it would take more than a two-person communications department to sort and present that and design that in a way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1761.916s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that makes it be what people need it to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1765.458s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we're now working collaboratively to completely overhaul that webpage, which I am quite excited about as a visual person myself, with the goal being that this becomes more of a site where when people have a question, maybe they've heard about Salem Street, maybe they've heard about the residential neighborhood proposal, they can navigate to that site, and it is impossible to miss up-to-date and current information, summaries, bullet points, FAQs, and diagrams, but let them know what's being worked on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1790.968s">[Kit Collins]</a>: who is currently talking about it, what body, and what the next public meetings are on that topic, when they can attend to ask questions and learn more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1800.073s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I hope that we'll also have, as Emily mentioned, there's also going to be very short-form digestible videos coming from Innes Associates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1807.297s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Those will be linked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1809.278s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And kind of the broader picture that we have for the website is not just to be very, very easily findable, digestible information about the current zoning proposals, but also to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1819.87s">[Kit Collins]</a>: do a better job of reinforcing for residents that these are not individual proposals that we're just taking up Salem Street and that's the end of the story or we're not just taking up Mystic Avenue corridor district and that's the end of the story but this is a coordinated really more than a year-long effort this is a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1836.461s">[Kit Collins]</a>: a citywide zoning review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1838.802s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So as people are finding out, okay, March 5, next meeting about Salem Street, good to know I can save that date, I can put it in my calendar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1845.544s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They're also seeing a timeline that reminds them that after Salem Street comes the neighborhood residential proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1850.705s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And after that, we'll be talking about squares and corridors, and letting people know that this is a citywide process that they can plug into any time between now and June, or they can kind of mark a month on their calendar and make sure to tune back in if there's a particular area that they're interested in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1866.972s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I am looking forward to those updates to the zoning page on the website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1874.118s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's a major one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1875.159s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have the series of explainer videos from Innes Associates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1878.502s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're working to, kind of in concert with all of this, be putting out more frequent updates in the form of fresh releases, collaboration between the city council and the mayor's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1890.331s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Essentially, we're trying to make sure that our announcements about these are touching all of our existing communications channels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1895.535s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We know that some people go on the website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1897.096s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We know that some people are signed up for the e-alerts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1899.497s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We know that some people do reverse 911.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1901.899s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We know that some people have social media.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1904.16s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we're trying to make sure that we are consistently creating information that's short form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1909.204s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What do you need to know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1910.224s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When is this going to be talked about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1911.525s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Information for each of the zoning proposals that can be shared on all of these communication channels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1917.189s">[Kit Collins]</a>: so that anybody who's interested at the very least can know where they can go to learn more and they can go to that place and actually learn more instead of getting confused and overwhelmed and then clicking away, or they can know where to watch a video or where to attend a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1932.103s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's the short form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1933.004s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I feel like there's probably something that I forgot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1935.097s">[Kit Collins]</a>: but the overall structure being that vastly improved web page on the city website, more frequent press release and social media updates paired with more frequent use of reverse 911 to let people know about upcoming meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=1955.764s">[Kit Collins]</a>: With that, are there, oh, thank you, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2155.926s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you very much, Councilor Hilliam.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2157.247s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2157.767s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that it's really important that in all of these updated materials going forward, especially through the use of diagrams and visuals, we should be saying that stuff verbally and linking people to the full documents and making sure that there are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2172.227s">[Kit Collins]</a>: really simple, really effective diagram showing, comparing the current zoning to what the current built environment actually is and showing what we love that's currently non-conforming that couldn't be built today with the current zoning, those heights and those densities, because of course that's a lot of what we talk about and a lot of what residents want us to be focusing on when we're talking about zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2194.355s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2197.627s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any additional questions before we go forward to the neighborhood residential topic?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2207.055s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing none.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2208.637s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we discussed the, we initiated the topic of the neighborhood residential two weeks ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2213.841s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We saw a kind of a jumping off point draft proposal from Innes Associates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2218.846s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We discussed it, we made some suggested changes already, which we'll be reviewing tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2225.111s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Kind of a slight downshifting and all of the sub districts was recommended by this council and I believe that the proposal will be seeing tonight reflects this, just because it was mentioned as as a concern that's been going around I do want to know just off the top for in case people jump off the meeting early.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2240.43s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In my understanding, it's currently not, triple-deckers are not proposed for Lawrence Estates, and that'll be shown in the, that'll be shown in the diagrams that we'll look at in just a little bit, but I just wanted to make sure that that was cleared up right at the beginning of the presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=2255.044s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So without further exposition, Paola, I'll pass it off to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3014.067s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3014.427s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Emily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3015.728s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And yes, it's on the City Council's public portal already as an attachment for this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3022.412s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So folks can download that and zoom all the way in like I've been doing the past couple of days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3028.636s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for the overview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3030.257s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I appreciate that note.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3032.558s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As with any other zoning proposal, this is about balance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3037.061s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that there are a lot of goals of reevaluating our zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3043.905s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Obviously, one of those goals is to say, where is incremental more density or more height or more this or more that appropriate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3051.353s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Another way of looking at it is to say, where are there a lot of non-conforming lots already that we should not make further out of compliance, that we should update the zoning so that it reflects what's already there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3062.304s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that some of the neighborhood residential proposal<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3067.437s">[Kit Collins]</a>: kind of centers those two questions at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3070.419s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was saying, where does it make sense that we should, where in the city is the transit proximity and the existing density and the roadways and the topography make it so it makes a lot of sense to incrementally up-zone here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3084.847s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And what are those areas where we actually, as we're trying to unify and make consistent,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3092.64s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One thing I heard is that I think that one of the, in a way, one of the amendments from two weeks ago might actually make a lot of what's existing on the ground in some single family two districts out of conforming with the proposed zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3104.446s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we wanna make sure that we're making things more coherent as opposed to less as this advances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3110.349s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I know I have some questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3111.629s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have some comments from reviewing these, but I want to first recognize other councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3117.552s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll go first to President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3263.843s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3270.245s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any other questions or comments from councilors at this point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3273.587s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We will take public participation at the end of this section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3275.828s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll note for myself, I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3282.478s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As one councillor, I think that this map that we're focusing on is probably the most important one of the presentation, kind of overlaying current land uses, current building types, and superimposing on top of that the proposed new sub-districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3298.943s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I really encourage everybody, councillors and the public, to focus on this one specifically as we continue to workshop this proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3307.142s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For me, it's very useful to be able to say okay what are the corresponding number of units between the proposed new sub districts and current building uses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3317.322s">[Kit Collins]</a>: letters and numbers for the proposed new sub districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3319.563s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we have color coded residential types for what's existentially on the ground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3323.284s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So for me, as I was looking at this map, I was saying, okay, anywhere that any section that is predominantly magenta means that the nine or more units that should probably be our urban residential number two sub district because it should be reflective of the density that's already there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3336.93s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I feel strongly as we already said that we should be down zoning nowhere in the city because that's counter to I think all of our goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3346.738s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that this is very instructive for those, most areas of the city, well, maybe not most, a lot of areas of the cities are mixed, which makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3354.901s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's why our neighborhoods are cozy and feel human scaled is because they're not just the same type of building over and over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3363.504s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think a lot of what we're talking about in this discussion is those neighborhoods where there's a mix of, you know, on this map, turquoise and orange and purple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3373.148s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you have some single family, you have some two family, maybe you have some condo conversion, you have a couple three families here and there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3379.43s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that is really the frontier where we're thinking, we're thinking of zoning, I think it's, it's accurate to think of it as a 30 year map, not a next year map.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3387.712s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think when we look at economic trends and building trends, we're building out the map that we want to see on the ground and in 30 or 40 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3397.234s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that's the ground where we have to be making those decisions about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3402.118s">[Kit Collins]</a>: for example, is that an NR3 or is it a UR1 or is it an NR2?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3408.8s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think for myself, there's a lot of areas in the city where you do see that mix of turquoise and purple, which is to say two family and three family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3419.222s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would probably like those to be an NR3 or potentially even a UR1.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3425.344s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in some of those zones that are especially proximate or bordering on the transit hubs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3431.087s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Because it's reflective of the density that we already enjoy and because we know that we need to add density and we should be putting it in the places where there's the greatest demand for it and the most supports for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3447.895s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3548.057s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3548.397s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for speaking to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3549.418s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I see any further questions or comments from councillors at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3556.003s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know this is a detailed map to parse, and that's how we're going to revisit it in future committee meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3563.249s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Not seeing any at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3564.49s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do think that, you know, as we've discussed before, I think that the historic conversion<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3570.03s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And the ADU's discussion is also an important piece of context for all of these sub-districts that we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=3574.474s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So if you feel it's appropriate, maybe we can proceed on to those parts of the presentation next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4135.29s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4135.831s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate that clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4137.232s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And as you say, yeah, I think for for any folks, including people in this room who zoning is not their day in and day out bread and butter, I think it's a helpful reminder that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4149.347s">[Kit Collins]</a>: lot size is a really important piece of the puzzle, but it's not the only criteria in deciding what use of building, what height of building, how many units can go on that parcel, because other conditions also must be satisfied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4163.479s">[Kit Collins]</a>: While we're talking about the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4166.046s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that this is a slide that you have already flagged for update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4170.27s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But if we can make sure that to just request for me for the diagram when it's updated to include the urban residential sub districts, if we can make sure that we're seeing models of the buildings that are 2 to 4 stories and above four stories, that'd be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4184.623s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And if it is possible to also add diagrams for the neighborhood residential sub districts displaying<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4191.729s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the buildings that are currently showed, and also one building with an ADU.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4195.111s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that will help to flesh out the range of possibilities under the proposed sub-districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4202.614s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4205.715s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4696.454s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Could you specify, Councilor Galleon, what's the part in West Medford that you're noting as neighborhood residential 2 that you thought was neighborhood residential 1?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4877.695s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it also makes sense at this point to kind of, as a segue off of that, to get specific on our next steps for this proposal overall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4885.642s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know I think that there's a couple notions for places where we'd want to see the sub-district assignments changed a little bit, that northern leg of West Medford being one of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4896.771s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I had another one that hasn't been mentioned so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4899.673s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that in terms of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4905.178s">[Kit Collins]</a>: How and where we go forward from here, I think we could certainly make additional amendments motions during this meeting asking for specific changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4913.042s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If Councilors wanted to state ideas and preferences on the record and then follow up before our next meeting through the chair to his associates, I think that that's that that would be another path.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4926.595s">[Kit Collins]</a>: we are going to be considering these sub-districts in the context of the map more fully fleshed out with the kind of broader conversation about urban residential one at our next meeting on this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4936.88s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that that will also be just a helpful piece of the conversation as the map gets more fully fleshed out and filled in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4943.283s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it would be helpful for us to consider everything in the context of everything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4948.405s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So Emily, I'll go to you before I continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=4952.467s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, wrong mic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5021.799s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5022.24s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I think that that makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5023.9s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And certainly this is a draft and will remain a draft for several meetings more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5029.583s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5085.89s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I think that we should use these sessions to, yeah, I think that the prevailing notion here is we're going to continue amending.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5093.315s">[Kit Collins]</a>: this map based on the concerns and preferences and questions voiced in this room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5098.076s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I suspect that this map will also will also continue to see an evolving version of this map based on the feedback that city staff has.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5105.118s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, so it seems to me like there's consensus for going back to the original jumping off point and making sure that we're finessing the gradient between NR one and NR two and that location map specifically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5116.961s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for raising that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5118.502s">[Kit Collins]</a>: While we're talking about sub district boundaries, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5125.278s">[Kit Collins]</a>: just so that you have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5126.378s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One question that I did have looking at this, the South of Boston Ave, there's like a little dog leg of NR2 off of NR3, kind of straddling North Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5140.901s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That might be the rightest subdistrict for that area, but it looks pretty similar in character to me to the NR3 that it borders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5147.242s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm also curious about what Somerville zoning borders that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5156.689s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I wonder if it might just keep it consistent to upgrade that to NR3 if it's gonna be bounded on all sides by effectively NR3 zoning as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5173.244s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, conscious of the time, there is another committee meeting to start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5177.227s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So are there any other, great, President Bears?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5193.038s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5193.758s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5194.118s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5246.195s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5247.276s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Again, I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5248.097s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I missed your hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5248.797s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's exactly right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5250.378s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're not taking any votes tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5251.899s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're not going to report this out of committee tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5254.701s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're looking at a draft for the second time, not the last time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5257.524s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think I expect we'll have two more meetings on the residential topic in this committee before it goes further along in the public process to the CBP and public Q&A session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5267.791s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you for clarifying that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5270.193s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This will most definitely see some more adjustments and revisions before it moves to the next step in the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5284.741s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes, thank you for the clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5286.621s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears back to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5434.255s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5434.555s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we have that noted as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5435.576s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's well worth looking into as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5441.8s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5442.08s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think this has been a really productive discussion around some of the boundaries and assignments for the sub-districts on this map, which is very much a draft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5451.107s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And like we just said, we're gonna see a lot more opportunities for amendments and adjustments to this based on councilors' continuing feedback, concerns that we hear from the public that we digest and deliberate on, as well as input from city staff throughout this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5467.1s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is my understanding, and Emily and Paola, please correct me if you see this differently, that kind of our main step at this point is to be considering these sub-district boundaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5477.149s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And at our next meeting on this residential topic, we'll be talking more about the urban residential one and two sub-districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5483.834s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And after we start to feel more solid on an evolved version of this map, then we'll be talking about the permitting process, that by right, not by right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5493.743s">[Kit Collins]</a>: per use for each sub-district, talking about dimensionals and standards and maybe even some design guidelines towards the tail end of this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5502.11s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is there anything major that I'm missing from that workflow?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5598.853s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5599.493s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I think this is certainly a phase of the process where there are a lot of information sources informing the evolving draft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5668.984s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5669.325s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you very much, Emily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5670.145s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that mapping workshop that we did over the summer, kind of before we got into the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5674.597s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The heavy lifting of the geography proposals was really helpful, and I think it'd be great to have another version of that as we're mid-process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5685.023s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you for working on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5691.927s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5692.688s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we can expect to see an updated version of this proposal in two weeks, along with more discussion on the urban<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5699.58s">[Kit Collins]</a>: residential subdistricts one and two, and we will take things from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5704.203s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And in the intervening time, hopefully we will see some more new communication strategies rolled out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5709.906s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we, of course, have the public meeting on the Salem Street Neighborhood Corridor District proposal to look forward to as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5715.95s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And green score will be discussed in CBB on February 5th, but Salem Street will not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5720.633s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That will be continued until March 5th to allow more time for public comment and Q&A.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5729.673s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are there any further questions or comments from Councilors before I go to public participation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5738.517s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing none, I'll go first to Zoom, because there are some folks who have had their hands up for a very long time, and then I will go to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5746.041s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Gaston, name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5748.102s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5851.726s">[Kit Collins]</a>: More or less than if I believe if you scroll up in the PowerPoint from the slide that was last screen shared, there is a earlier version of the map.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5944.343s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll make sure to note that as this goes forward in the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5947.785s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for your comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=5951.468s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6019.681s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6022.142s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bearsia.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6023.123s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Certainly, that's an area that we want to pay special attention to as we continue to finesse these boundaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6028.105s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll go next to the podium and then back to Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6031.787s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6034.657s">[Kit Collins]</a>: for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6036.478s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, I forgot that the microphone was all the way over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6050.185s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, that's what I'm doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6062.172s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Try it again, William.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6215.635s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you very much for your comments, William.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6221.799s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Back to Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6222.439s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I recognize you, Michael.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6224.32s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6225.701s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And you have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6520.046s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for your comments, Michael appreciate this awful commentary, and we'll be sure to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6525.768s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sure a lot of that will come up in our future discussions of dimensionals and making sure that this zoning is what we want it to be which is implementable and creating a more streamlined process for people to build the type of properties that we know that we in the community want to see here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6543.065s">[Kit Collins]</a>: meeting materials are almost always posted on the City Council public portal ahead of the meeting times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6550.089s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we are working to populate that updated zoning website so that that'll be a more useful information source as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6557.093s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go next to Wren on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6559.254s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm gonna ask you to unmute, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6561.015s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, and their hand just went down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6564.437s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So please raise your hand again if you do have, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6569.7s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6570.94s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And you're gonna have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6756.443s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you so much for that commentary run I really hear you on those specific diagrams that you mentioned and we're working to see how we can operationalize that for all of our proposals going forward as I agree, I think that's really helpful visual tool for people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6772.578s">[Kit Collins]</a>: go back to Enos Associates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6818.417s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you so much for those clarifications, Emily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6824.722s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I see no further public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6827.885s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just again to recap, at our next committee meeting, which I don't know the date for that off the top of our head, but it'll be in two weeks, we are going to talk more about the residential proposal, the more, February 12th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6840.771s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great day to talk about neighborhood residential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6842.472s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Before that, we will have the public Q&A on the Salem Street Neighborhood Court District, February 5th, 6.30 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6849.756s">[Kit Collins]</a>: at the Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6851.696s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we are continuing to work on shipping more of these updated, what'd you say?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6856.899s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, February 10th, not February 5th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6860.281s">[Kit Collins]</a>: February 5th is when the CDB will not be talking about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6863.726s">[Kit Collins]</a>: be talking about other exciting concepts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6866.587s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Every attempt is the public you and I. Well, since I'm starting to misspeak, I think this would be a great time for a motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6874.149s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On the motion on the motion to adjourn by President Bears seconded by Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6878.85s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All those in favor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6881.771s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All this post.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6882.311s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6882.631s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There should be a voice vote because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6887.683s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6888.743s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6889.524s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6889.944s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, George.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6890.484s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6894.726s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6895.866s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZj4ALY_njg&t=6896.667s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, NS Associates, for your thoughtful stewardship, as always.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=876.12s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears this was a meeting of the planning and permitting committee to have our first look at the neighborhood residential topic it will be continued at our next planning and permitting committee meeting which is tomorrow and for future meeting dates after that motion to approve on the motion of Vice President Collins to approve seconded by Councilor Callahan all those in favor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1130.988s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1131.788s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanted to thank Councilor Tseng for putting this forward and join with him in wishing all of our residents a very happy Lunar New Year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1136.911s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1939.461s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears, and I appreciate this conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1942.963s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that a lot of... I'm really glad to see the progress that we've made over the past couple of weeks in seeing the assessor's office do such good work in sharing information about potential abatement programs with any and all residents who need it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1960.771s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know this is an incredibly busy time of year for the assessor's office, but this is a really critical function of their work as well to connect with residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1968.795s">[Kit Collins]</a>: who need assistance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1971.256s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And when it comes to the questions that have been coming in from the community, you know, when a person says, hey, I don't understand this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1977.338s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1978.239s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I need more information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1979.339s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's not a political question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1980.44s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's just a really human question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1982.24s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so I'm really grateful for the assessor's office for making so much time and freeing up so much energy to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1989.023s">[Kit Collins]</a>: field those questions as they come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1990.525s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm grateful to my fellow Councilors for helping direct people to the resources that they really need at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1996.05s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Of course, I think that, you know, this change in our property tax structure was needed, and the process to make sure that everybody understands what comes next is vitally important, and we can't afford to have that be any less robust than it absolutely can be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2009.884s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The same goes for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2011.245s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, all of these parts that make up our ecosystem of how we deal with property tax bills in the city, whether that's our exemptions, our abatement programs, and then the communications that come, you know, before and after all of this, making sure that people know what their options are, and how to understand and take steps on their property tax bills, regardless of the year, because abatements and exemptions are something that people need year in and year out, whether there's an override or whether there isn't one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2035.801s">[Kit Collins]</a>: just due to the economy that we're in and the nature of rapidly escalating, you know, assessed home values in Medford before or after the override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2047.548s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I really am glad for the opportunity to focus on that and thank the assessor's office and talk about what the city council can continue to do to make sure that we are supporting city staff in connecting residents with resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2058.575s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and making sure that all of that information about what to do gets out to the people who it's intended to connect with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2064.897s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also think that this is the right time to start talking about a residential exemption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2070.879s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is really complicated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2071.979s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A residential exemption would not benefit all residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2075.6s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It would not even benefit all homeowners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2078.221s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I do think that we have a responsibility to discuss it and to discuss it seriously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2081.942s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's something that we should start to do in committee at the whole or the administration and finance committee as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2088.323s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So all that being said, I'm grateful to the councilor for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2091.624s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that there's a lot of really, really important and timely topics here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2094.725s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I would like to put forward a lightly amended version of the paper that I'd be comfortable voting yes on tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2102.707s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I put this forward as a friendly amendment or as a B paper, if the councilor is more amenable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2109.629s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That would be, whereas the city of Medford has expanded all tax exemptions for members of vulnerable communities, including our senior, disabled, and veteran neighbors to the maximum extent allowed under state law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2121.135s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And whereas in the past, state and federal grants have been utilized in the city of Medford to support our local businesses, such as the 2024 Massachusetts vacant storefront program and the 2022 small business facade improvement grant program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2134.903s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Whereas implementing a residential exemption would decrease the tax burden for some residential property owners, be it resolved that the City Council continue to work with the Assessor's Office and the Mayor's Communications Office in sharing information about debatement processes with any and all residents who could benefit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2150.971s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Be it resolved that the City Council craft a Home Rule petition to ask the state to allow us to further expand our tax exemption options for these rural-local groups so that we may offer even greater tax exemption programs than what we are currently allowed to offer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2163.758s">[Kit Collins]</a>: be it further resolved that the City Council meet in the Administration and Finance Committee to discuss a potential residential exemption, and be it further resolved that the City Administration continue to prioritize and pursue any and all state, federal, and private grant opportunities targeted at assisting our business opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4023.425s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4024.186s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli for putting this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4026.468s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that this is a really important resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4029.55s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this is another issue where we can do a lot of good by doing a better job at getting to the community the information that is out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4037.698s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've also been communicating with residents about the GLX parking zone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4041.361s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I live in that zone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4042.122s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know I'm not the only councilor who does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4044.504s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have seen both the pros and the cons firsthand, most especially when I try to park my car after getting home from a city council meeting at 1 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4051.89s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and then circling down the block three to five times and then parking on a cross street, which is now legal to do, which is great, but the circling is not the fun part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4060.017s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Anyway, I've been communicating with residents who have been noticing the types of changes that I have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4065.622s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it's been helpful for me to the extent of my knowledge, explain the pros and the cons and the why of the new program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4071.184s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But obviously this is something that our parking department should be doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4073.585s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is something that our communications department should be doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4076.526s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And there are a lot of residents who still have questions and still have a hard time finding what the policies are and where they are on the website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4084.529s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Recently, a resident came to me with a parking policy that was indeed on the city website that I had never heard of before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4092.492s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think this is a good thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4094.094s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It would be great for the council to meet the new parking director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4096.495s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'd be happy to host this in the planning and permitting committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4098.917s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'd also be happy for this to be a committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4101.899s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think that this is a, you know, whichever the council prefers, I'll support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4105.602s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this will be a productive conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4107.343s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6040.821s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just want to thank the Council President for his collaboration with City's legal support to make sure that we respond to this in the way that we're statutorily obligated to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6050.887s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Now that this response is being formulated and will be sent in accordance with the rules and regulations, what would an appropriate vote at this meeting be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6058.752s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Would it be to receive and place on file, to authorize the Council President to continue promulgating a response?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6071.201s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, I would make a motion to accept the response as drafted by Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6087.331s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6091.081s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6091.381s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I probably should have, just for the purpose of clarity, prefaced my comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6094.963s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In addition to our next steps, I also just want to purpose this discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6099.006s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this complaint is flagrantly frivolous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6103.889s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's something that we have to attend to, we have to respond to in these ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6106.811s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm glad that we're doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6108.452s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6111.014s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I find it curious that a non-resident of the city is taking it upon themselves to waste elected officials' times because of time spent lobbying for state-level policy that would make sure that fewer people have to sleep on the street in the winter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6126.325s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6318.948s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears, we had a really helpful informative committee of the whole about this a couple weeks ago, or maybe it was just last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6327.597s">[Kit Collins]</a>: couple weeks ago, just last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6331.201s">[Kit Collins]</a>: went through all of the projects in detail the funding recommendations, the specifics on the programs will be funded it's always great to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6338.428s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, an unanimous vote by the committee, which I think is almost always the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6344.67s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that there's so much thought and research put into vetting the many programs that compete for this funding, and they all do such incredible work in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6351.233s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I appreciate Manager DuPont and Chair Cameron for making sure that we got a really thorough walk through all of the details at the meeting last week to prepare us for this vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6362.617s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm happy to make a motion for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6364.398s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6953.395s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6955.596s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Again, last week, we got a quick briefing on why it made sense for these funding sources to be shuffled around, essentially that for a historic restoration project, which is kind of like the more limited that we should use funds that are very, very limited to historic preservation on historic preservation projects, rather than having that dip into the CPC fund, which could be used for other uses that we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6981.242s">[Kit Collins]</a>: keep that funding available for other things such as tennis courts that need to be patched up so people can play on them and a lot of other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=6988.125s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I appreciate the mayor's office for putting together a formal recommendation so that we can make that exchange and keep funding sources available for how they're gonna be most effective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7000.729s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I would motion to approve pending other comments or questions from my fellow Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7137.535s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just give me a second to get on the Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7167.808s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7183.52s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7184.501s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for your patience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7187.783s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That was onto 25019.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7192.0s">[Kit Collins]</a>: offered by Mayor Breanna Lungo-Koehn, approval of funding for legal settlement in the amount of $7,500.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7197.285s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Dear President Bears and members of the City Council, I respectfully request and recommend that, nope, that was the last one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7208.554s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7213.374s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to present bears and honorable members of the city council from Brianna lungo current mayor January 22 2025.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7217.738s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The claimants carrot and just that the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7223.921s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For Salati, seat compensation for property damage suffered allegedly as a result of a blocked sewer line on High Street resulting in sewage backflow entering the basement of a home located at 206 High Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7234.948s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A global settlement has been reached pursuant to which the city will pay $7,500 and the owner slash operator of the nearby Medford Rehabilitation and Nursing Center will pay $7,500.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7244.534s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A form settlement agreement and release has been agreed upon and will be executed upon city council approval of the funding of the settlement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7252.799s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Attorney Roger Smirage will be in attendance via Zoom to provide the council with guidance on this matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7258.183s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Breakdown to amount requested, medical cost, $0, lost wages, $0, property damage, $7,500.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7263.746s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Other $0, total settlement, $7,500.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7267.108s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I understand that we have legal counsel on the Zoom tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7273.352s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If any, we'll go to the attorney first and then we'll hear comments, questions, or motions from Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7372.593s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much attorney for being with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7373.913s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I understand that the initial offer was that the city might've been on the hook for 25,000 and this was able to be negotiated down to 7,500 that the city will pay in addition to the 7,500 from the Medford Rehabilitation Center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7388.516s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7391.396s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On a motion to approve by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7396.437s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7398.578s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7399.199s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're going to do a roll call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7402.181s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mr. Clerk, whenever you're ready.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7422.975s">[Kit Collins]</a>: 6 in favor, one absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7424.376s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7425.036s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for being with us, attorney.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7427.29s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Have a good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7435.653s">[Kit Collins]</a>: 2-5-0-2-0 offered by Mayor Breanna Lungo-Koehn, transfer and conveyance of McCormick Avenue parcels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7441.614s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Dear President Bearss and members of the City Council, I respectively request and recommend that your honorable body approve the following transfer and conveyance of city property which will transfer<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7451.437s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to the mayor, the care, custody and control of two vacant parcels of vacant land on McCormick Avenue that have remained unused since the city acquired said parcels in 1950 pursuant to a tax title taking, and authorize the mayor to convey said parcels in compliance with General Laws Chapter 30B, the Uniform Procurement Act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7469.284s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The city will benefit by putting the unused parcels to productive and tax-producing uses, and further, the city may, subject to appropriation by the City Council,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7479.908s">[Kit Collins]</a>: for the purpose of promoting affordable housing or for such other purposes as the City Council determines is in the best interest of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7488.012s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A resolution to transfer and authorize the sale of McCormick Avenue parcels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7492.014s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Whereas the city is the owner of two parcels of land located on McCormick Avenue, each containing 3,600 square feet, more or less, identified in the assessors as parcels F13-37 and F13-38,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7505.9s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and described in certificate of title number 166463 filed with the Middlesex South Registry District of the Land Court together the city property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7515.744s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Whereas the city property has been vacant and unused since the city acquired the city property in 1950 pursuant to a tax taking and is surplus to the needs of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7523.347s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Whereas there is an urgent need to promote and develop affordable housing in the city of Medford and in the region.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7528.91s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Whereas the sale of the city property will benefit the city by putting the city property to productive and tax generating uses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7534.813s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And whereas the sale of said sale, the proceeds of said sale may be used by the city for the purpose of promoting affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7542.463s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Now, therefore, be it that the city council hereby declares that the city property is surplus to the needs of the city and available for disposition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7549.813s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and that the city council hereby transfers the care, custody, and control of the city property from the tax custodian for tax settle purposes to the mayor for general municipal purposes and or for the purpose of disposition on such terms and conditions as is in the best interest of the city, and that the mayor may be authorized to convey the city's right title and interest in said city property provided that said sale is in compliance with the provisions of General Laws Chapter 30B, the Uniform Procurement Act,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7576.594s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and to take any and all other action as may be necessary or appropriate to accomplish that disposition and that this resolution shall take effect upon passage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7584.84s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Attorney Everett will be in attendance via Zoom to provide the council with guidance on this matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7589.364s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for your kind attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7590.705s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sincerely, Brianna Lugar-Curran, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7593.687s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Maybe I'll first recognize Attorney Everett to give any comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7604.419s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're having a hard time hearing you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7605.6s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is it possible to speak into your microphone on your end?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7613.243s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I can't hear her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7614.244s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're having a very hard time hearing you in the chambers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7625.689s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Can you hold on two seconds?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7626.849s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to see if we can adjust some settings in our council booth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7632.04s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, please hang with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7648.785s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, if you could begin again, Attorney Everett, our audio person is going to try to make some adjustments as you're speaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7658.253s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes, that's better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7658.873s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7659.253s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7659.594s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7710.073s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Attorney Everett.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7711.474s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So the request for proposals is specifically looking for buyers for the properties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7717.358s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is the intent here to look for purchases for the properties or to, that will then develop it or just to look for suitable purchases for these properties?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=7767.13s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is that correct, Attorney Everett, that this vote is to convey the parcels from their current tax custodianship so that they can be disposed of by the mayor's office?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8041.249s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8042.39s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's an important question that you raised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8045.293s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I didn't see who put their hand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8046.654s">[Kit Collins]</a>: First, I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8047.475s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll go to Councilor Leming and then Councilor Callahan and then Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8237.136s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8238.036s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll go next to Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8242.138s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Did I get it right this time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8252.804s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What number microphone are you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8255.526s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Who's number three?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8258.886s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8259.507s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well, we're going to we're going to go to Emily first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8261.612s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8359.572s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8472.496s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8655.541s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is it, Attorney Everett, if I may piggyback on your question, is it true that if the lots are to be sold for some amount of money, is City Council approval required for any appropriation of that money or just for an appropriation, for example, into the Affordable Housing Trust?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8671.112s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Like, will the City Council oversight on how the funds are used in any case or only in certain cases?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8731.584s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll go next to Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8798.977s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8799.617s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If I may cut in here, I don't want to speculate on the intent of this strategy, nor do I want to put forward the impression that I'm contemplating all of the possible consequences that could come from this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8814.163s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think that one of the questions that this council is deliberating on is if two of our options are to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8823.363s">[Kit Collins]</a>: explore ways when the properties as they currently are could be transferred in some way to the Affordable Housing Trust or Community Land Trust so that affordable housing may be developed there on those lots?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8835.949s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Or should we use the sale of those lots to create funding that theoretically could be used to create more numerous affordable housing units elsewhere in the city?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8848.575s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that that is not a frivolous question because I think that a shared goal is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8853.037s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to make sure that there's affordable housing available everywhere throughout the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8856.999s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Of course, some areas of the city we need dense housing, we need a lot of affordable housing, but we need affordable housing in every area of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8864.484s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I can't make motions, but I would certainly feel more comfortable voting on this if we met in a community hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8870.387s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And if we met in a committee of the whole with a representative from the mayor's team, perhaps with members of the Affordable Housing Trust and other city staff to remain to the issue to make sure that we're kind of aware of the whole flowchart of options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8885.007s">[Kit Collins]</a>: from the sale, perhaps with a memo from the mayor's office outlining their intent in pursuing the RFP route that they have been pursuing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8894.812s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Essentially, you know, this is coming to the city council after a lot of thought has already gone into it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8897.994s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sure that that thought has been done in good faith.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8901.415s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But this is a big deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8903.897s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Transferring city property so it can be sold is a big deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8906.658s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And as one councilor who can't make motions, I would feel more comfortable if we had time to deliberate on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8927.425s">[Kit Collins]</a>: on the motion to table by Councilor Tseng pending a meeting in a committee of the whole with pertinent members of the Mayor's Administration and representatives from the Affordable Housing Trust, seconded by Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8940.491s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8941.151s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8942.351s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All those opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8944.772s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion passes and the paper will be tabled and myself and President Bears will<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8951.492s">[Kit Collins]</a>: work to get that committee of the whole set up with supporting documents and research.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8956.876s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Attorney Everett, thank you so much for being on the call with us this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8959.578s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8966.723s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We move now to public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8969.224s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any member who wishes to speak can approach the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8974.788s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have to give your name and address for the record, and then you'll have three minutes to address the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8981.742s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, hang on one sec.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8983.763s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There you go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8984.123s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Now your mic is live.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8984.863s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=9241.777s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for your comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=9244.459s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=9245.293s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=9245.673s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=9246.914s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And you have three minutes as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=9313.414s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=9313.794s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We don't usually do screen sharing from public presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=9318.295s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But you have two more minutes if you'd like to continue your comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=9399.873s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you very much for being with us today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=9400.894s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=9408.498s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is there anybody else for public participation in the chambers or on Zoom?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=9451.307s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I recognize Councilor Lazzaro, if you want to respond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=9513.13s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=9514.15s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In my understanding, I'm not a member of the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee, but my understanding is that with the listening sessions, the target audience is the folks who organically gather at the community center where the listening sessions are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=9526.774s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm sure that the promotion is focused on those folks who are already going to be there for various purposes so that the frequent attendees, rather than the broader general public, can be met by councilors at these places that they are already going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=9567.871s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I see no other candidates for public participation on Zoom or in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=9575.475s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing none, is there a second for the motion to adjourn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=9578.307s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seconded by Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=9580.175s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=9580.777s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=9581.942s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=9583.147s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=9583.829s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=9584.432s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2059.533s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4899.717s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7059.066s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Chair Sine, I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7062.469s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I really appreciate the discussion on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7065.631s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So far, I know that this is, you know, we come to this discussion after months of work and outreach and diligence and research by the members of the Charter Study Committee and the Collins Center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7076.44s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I just want to, again, state how much I appreciate all of that hard work and that collaboration so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7086.761s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So my thoughts on this issue, again, going to restate some of what was already said by my fellow Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7093.223s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Of course, we could see from the data that respondents who did respond to the survey favored ward-based representation when compared to all at large.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7104.346s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do think that it is significant that district based and other models were not given as options for comparison.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7111.349s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's not a criticism.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7112.67s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's just simply that I don't think that that means that this council should have this discussion as though those options are not also on the table because we have a responsibility to do our due diligence and make amendments or approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7126.095s">[Kit Collins]</a>: or approve the proposal based on what we think will be best for the long-term future of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7134.021s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My bottom line is I think that the proposed amendment regarding composition still represents a very, very big improvement towards more localized representation, making representation much more localized than it has been in a very, very long time, perhaps ever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7146.45s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7151.504s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we all know, we all concur that running in a smaller pool in some ways reduces the barriers to running for office, especially financially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7160.153s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have to fundraise less.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7161.455s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Fundraising is very difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7164.298s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I don't think that we should discuss this as if that is the whole story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7170.004s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to improving representation and making representation more proportional to demographics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7176.389s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think that ward-based representation is a panacea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7180.151s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I certainly don't think that it's a panacea for making marginalized populations more equitably represented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7185.195s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that for us to pursue that as though it's a silver bullet,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7192.27s">[Kit Collins]</a>: would be a misguided reason to pursue a ward-based representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7197.636s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Running is inherently difficult for millions of reasons, and I do believe that it will take decades or more to truly equalize the playing field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7204.843s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think my bottom line on this is that wards do not deserve simple representation full stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7210.289s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What wards deserve is compelling and competitive elections each and every time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7215.434s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I have concerns that the proposal that we're currently looking at from the Charter Study Committee, I'm very concerned that those elections would not result in compelling and competitive elections each and every time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7230.966s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My research has indicated to me that in quite small wards like we have in Medford, the pool of candidates tends to be very small.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7238.872s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's very common for incumbents to go unchallenged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7242.454s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And for incumbents, when they do decide that they want to retire from those elected positions, to privately appoint a successor, put off their announcement until the last moment, which all but ensures that other challenges do not have the time to jump in the race and have a real shot at participating in that competitive election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7262.18s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I don't think that that is democratic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7263.641s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think that that is our shared goal for more competitive and more locally representative offices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7273.655s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Lastly, I'll just say, you know, I know that this is this is a big deal because this is the guiding document for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7279.719s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And hopefully I am really confident that we will arrive at a document that all of us can feel, you know, like any product of compromise that we can all feel a little bit good about and a little bit wistful about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7289.506s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But as city councilors, it is our responsibility to apply our perspective and our good faith opinions to this process, even in perhaps especially when it's unpopular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7301.434s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's certainly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7304.083s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's certainly more politically expedient to do what is popular, but our job is to research and advance what we think would be best for the community in the long run, regardless of the impact on us as individual electeds and individual future candidates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7319.129s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's the reason for my opinion on this matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7323.211s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8624.623s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Chair Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8625.704s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8627.565s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have some comments that I wanna add, and then I'm going to also make a motion at the end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8634.148s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, I would love to get back to a place where this conversation is productive and civil, like it was at the beginning of the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8641.01s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But first, I do have to say, I find it a little rich that one Councilor will start the meeting talking about maturing and being open minded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8648.312s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then the instant that their colleagues start to disagree with them, the conversation turns to personal attacks and blaming colleagues for rending the city apart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8656.114s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wish that we could have civil and productive conversations about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8659.895s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and I don't think that's productive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8661.857s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm really respectful to the conversation at all, not after all of the work that has been put into this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8667.441s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No one said that some wards do not need representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8669.883s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What was said, not by me, is that some wards are so low turnout and some wards are so high turnout that it would create a huge disparity in some residents' votes among others, counting some very, very highly, and other votes would matter much less numerically, and that's not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8687.657s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think that we should be trading one form of unrepresentativeness for another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8691.399s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And if we're going to, I at least think that we should be able to acknowledge it and acknowledge that it matters and talk about potential mitigating solutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8702.244s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I hope that people will take it to heart that I am willing to potentially disagree with people with whom I share values because I have honest concerns about the current charter provisions as proposed, and I am willing to face criticism over that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8717.19s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I simply think that we should prioritize genuine representation and genuine efficacy over well-intentioned, but I think less effective, appearances of representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8727.86s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I don't think that we can accomplish that by simply adding numbers to the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8731.523s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And for reasons that have already been stated by me and by others, I don't think that the simple ward-based system is the best way of doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8739.94s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that we have received a lot of feedback about the award-based versus all-at-large options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8745.942s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Again, I think that we need to consider that these were the only two options presented in the survey, and we should consider those data points in the context of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8753.145s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There weren't other data points on the table or on the survey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8758.537s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Something that guides all of my decisions on the council is knowing that people, all people, myself included, it's human nature to overly weight feedback that is visible to us, like opinions that we happen to have heard, people that we happen to have heard from, and forget that other opinions that we happen to happen to have heard, that we didn't ask for, that are not as visible, that didn't hear about a survey, that don't have opportunities to come to city council meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8782.885s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's human nature to overweight the information that we have heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8786.946s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and kind of forget that other information exists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8790.849s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I bring this up not just because for me it is a really useful reminder when I'm making any decision on the City Council, but also because I think it's incredibly relevant to this project, because the work of the City Charter, especially talking about composition,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8805.54s">[Kit Collins]</a>: is about better representation for those people in the community who are not as visible, who don't have access to our normal communication channels, who don't know how to get in contact with their city councilors, who do not vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8818.932s">[Kit Collins]</a>: To me, that is the goal of this section of the city charter, is try to get better at that exact mechanism.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8826.67s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I believe that a district model is our best option for lifting up and better representing people who are currently underrepresented, even in light of the feedback that we have seen, which was based on the two options presented in the survey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8839.157s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think it's very relevant that this is a project that has been worked on by people who are highly involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8845.26s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it's our job to approve a product that will work the best and the most fairly for people who are already highly involved and for people who have not been able to be highly involved, for people who are underrepresented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8856.915s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All that being said, I do think that this is a good moment for compromise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8861.59s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that a lot of good points have been made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8865.817s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've been very clear that I think that the district-based model makes the most sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8869.618s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm also not opposed to a larger council, not at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8874.159s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's not my preference, but I'm not opposed to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8876.959s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Leming earlier entertained the idea of sticking with four district councilors, but expanding the number to five at-large councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8885.781s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would be happy to offer that in the form of a motion to President Bierer's proposed amendments if he is willing to accept it as a friendly amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8896.183s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9543.792s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Chair Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9546.233s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9546.833s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate those comments from President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9548.634s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that gets right to the heart of the issue as I see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9552.436s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One last point on this through the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9558.215s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If my fellow councilors' opinions earlier were in good faith about outcomes and not about politicking and taking shots to make perceived opponents look bad, I think that then he would be sticking to the substance at hand and not derailing this conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9572.419s">[Kit Collins]</a>: With lies about us voting in lockstep and other false narratives, I also encourage people to run the tape or look at our duly promulgated council records.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9581.202s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And people will find that the Councilors on this body who share an endorsement just disagree with each other all the time, which I believe is how it should be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9590.107s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate the discussion so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9593.649s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have made a motion that the five district Councilors and five at large Councilors be considered as part of President Bear's amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9604.655s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would request that we move on to public comment and then take votes on motions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9610.338s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9617.588s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes, that is what I meant to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9618.709s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=15399.844s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=320.339s">[Kit Collins]</a>: 15th, 2025.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=320.939s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This meeting will take place at 6pm in the City Council Chamber, second floor, Medford City Hall, and via Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=327.505s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=342.213s">[Kit Collins]</a>: present, five present, zero absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=344.434s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The meeting is called to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=346.556s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The action discussion item for this committee meeting is again, 24-033, zoning ordinance updates with the Innes Associates team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=355.641s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is the first planning and permitting committee meeting of the new year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=365.287s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have seen a lot of work in this committee so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=368.469s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A lot of that is still ongoing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=373.063s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=373.784s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We shepherded through the Mystic Avenue Corridor District proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=377.507s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The Salem Street Corridor District proposal is still being considered in public meetings by the Community Development Board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=383.913s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The Green Score proposal is still being considered in public meetings by the Community Development Board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=387.797s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's a lot of things in the pipeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=389.979s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Tonight, we are beginning our consideration, just the very beginning of the conversation on a new topic, which is the neighborhood residential topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=399.83s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So before I turn it over to our zoning consultant, I just kind of want to orient us to the goal of this meeting, what we're gonna be looking at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=406.914s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This topic, which we're calling neighborhood residential, is just a jumping off place for adjusting the zoning rules for the areas of the city that are currently residential and zoned as single family one or single family two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=418.039s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There are districts like this throughout the city, as everybody knows, but they're especially concentrated in North Medford, West Medford, with some pockets in Glenwood, Wellington, and Hillsides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=429.409s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So why are we looking at SF1 and two districts now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=433.852s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, the same goals that carry us through the rest of the city for the rest of our zoning overhaul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=438.917s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We know that there are areas of the city where the zoning does not reflect what is currently built on the ground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=445.683s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We know that there are areas of the city where the zoning isn't allowing us to use our property or land the way that we know community members want us to, where it could better affirm our goals or where it could better affirm just what's already there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=459.546s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we also know that we have a need to allow for more housing development in Medford to keep pace with high demand, high scarcity, and increasingly high property valuations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=468.831s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And zoning can offer tools to help us with all these problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=472.953s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So with a lot of the current SF districts, we know we'll have to let geography and context guide the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=477.655s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For example, in North Medford, narrow winding streets and steepness affect what is appropriate and possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=484.282s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We also do have areas that are next to, for example, some brand new transit hubs, and it doesn't make sense to not take advantage of those areas of the city for greater density in a thoughtful way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=492.172s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So in just a minute, I'm going to turn it over to Paola from NS Associates for slides about what we're going to be considering tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=501.964s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This presentation<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=503.772s">[Kit Collins]</a>: will walk us through a jumping off point for considering some new neighborhood residential approaches and existing SF and GR.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=511.842s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It also incorporates what new state law dictates around allowing ADUs by right in single family districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=520.731s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just to recenter on the goals for tonight before we get into the weeds, and I know that pal is also going to reorient us in kind of the where this falls in the overall trajectory of, you know, what topics have come before this and what topics will come after this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=533.54s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Tonight we're not looking at a proposal that we're going to be voting on or approving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=538.003s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is to serve as a jumping-off point that's based on the current zoning of SF1 and 2 districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=543.745s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're very much not going to do this all in one fell swoop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=547.086s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My goals for tonight is for this to be councilors' chance to put their initial thoughts, concerns, questions, requests for changes on the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=554.029s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Then we'll come back at our next meeting in two weeks, and as associates, we'll have taken all of that feedback and put together an amended proposal that we'll look at again before it is then referred for further review in more public meetings by the CDB.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=568.14s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So at this point, I see President Bears has his hand up, and then I'll turn it over to Paula.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=660.261s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=661.081s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, I will now recognize Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=666.944s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thanks as always for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=734.272s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm going to take your time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=735.873s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is the screen frozen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=790.37s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are you not able to share, Paola?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=791.831s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Like, is it not reflecting what's on your screen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=797.295s">[Kit Collins]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=799.016s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I can share on my side if that is easier, but you'd have to tell me when to switch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2094.414s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for the presentation, Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2096.095s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2097.055s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that this gives us a pretty substantive jumping off point for talking about, you know, kind of the why and what next of developing amended zoning rules for these types of neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2109.723s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm gonna recognize Councilor Scarpelli first, but just to quickly bookend the presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2113.505s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think some of the language that I find, like, really useful about this is thinking about creating a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2121.605s">[Kit Collins]</a>: new, more appropriate gradient from our most single-family, our most classic single-family lots, a lot of which will be kind of maintained exactly as they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2131.893s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think a lot of the zoning that currently exists makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2135.036s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Maybe the terminology needs to be updated, but a lot of that will remain that way and has to remain that way, but we can affect the gradient from smallest, least dense up to the most dense parts of the city in a way that creates that range of housing that we know that we really need and kind of fill in some of those<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2151.329s">[Kit Collins]</a>: gaps where people need types of housing that aren't being built because they either can't be developed under our current zoning or we haven't encouraged it enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2159.253s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you for that language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2160.133s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that that's a really helpful way of thinking about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2163.415s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just one really quick clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2164.715s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know you're going to come back to this on the ADU's piece when we're talking about that law being developed that is a state law that communities like Medford will be obligated to factor into their zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2174.38s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'll first recognize Councilor Scarpelli and then we'll go to President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2424.121s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you Councilor I really do appreciate that feedback and, you know, I think that there is a lot in there that I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2433.035s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, that I agree with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2433.976s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think, well, since our last meeting wrapped up at midnight last night, a lot of what I've been working on today has been kind of revamping that communications strategy that we can use so that, you know, the next six months of this zoning project are better communicated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2450.687s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think the highlight for me, and I think this speaks to some of what you're saying, is that the information is out there, the meetings are public, the answers are out there, but they need to be easier to find.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2459.173s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's what we're working on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2461.534s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And follow through on the plan that me and President Bears are drafting as council leadership to make that successful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2468.022s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It'll take the collaboration of the city administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2471.906s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think you're right that, you know, there's so much positive in these proposals and we really want to be able to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2477.893s">[Kit Collins]</a>: broadcast and communicate well with the community to answer their questions easily and quickly so that people can know exactly what's going on, be informed, and ideally be as excited as we are about implementing the goals that the community put into the comprehensive plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2493.024s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you for that comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2494.525s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It really- Appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2497.808s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we're working on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2499.689s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2501.731s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll recognize President Bears next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2679.725s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Perez.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2680.525s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Would you email that motion to myself as well as the clerk?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2693.668s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2697.432s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll wait for that to come through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2698.312s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I might need part of that reread, but that was to remove neighborhood residential four, have that be considered instead as part of the urban residential that we'll be considering in February, those denser districts, and then to downshift neighborhood residential two and three to kind of step the gradient down by one level of density.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2721.217s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is that an accurate synopsis?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2722.658s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know I left out a lot of the detail that you mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2733.76s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=2738.023s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll go to Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3056.527s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Does that address your question, Councilor Callahan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3058.228s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think you were talking about the difference between SF1 and SF2, NR1 and NR2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3161.148s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's just not constantly on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3398.154s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3398.794s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3400.255s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I see a couple hands up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3402.516s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We will take all public participation at the end of the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3404.797s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3405.837s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll go next to President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3443.852s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3444.352s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3450.194s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'll reread both motions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3453.629s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The one that was just made was motion by President Bears to request that the chair work with the administration to increase accessible materials, notices, and communications about upcoming meetings and distribute them to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3468.357s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And the, do I hear a motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3470.178s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3471.598s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seconded by Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3474.588s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And the first motion given towards the beginning of the meeting was the motion to adjust the proposed neighborhood residential districts by removing the NR4 district type and consider that as part of urban residential topic as a potential urban residential one district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3493.097s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Classifying all areas currently on the proposal listed as NR1 and NR2 as just NR1.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3498.722s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that's a downshift from NR2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3501.725s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Classifying all areas currently on the proposal listed as NR3 as NR2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3507.19s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Classifying all areas currently on the proposal listed as NR4 as NR3.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3513.016s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Adjust the NR3 district type to remove the one unit dwelling by right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3518.857s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And any parcel where the current district is general residential should be at least NR2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3525.085s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And any parcels, sorry, the last bit of this got cut off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3533.916s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3537.594s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And any, sorry, that last clause is any parcel where the current district is general residential should be at least NR2, and any parcels where the district, current district is apartment one or apartment two should be at least NR3.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3550.742s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Does anybody need that read back again, put on the screen, or do I hear a second on the motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3565.312s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Leming?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3566.292s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3643.038s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You want to finish your thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3649.837s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You're six.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3650.938s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, guys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3703.645s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, so the current wording classifying all areas currently on the proposal listed as NR1 and NR2 as NR1.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3712.387s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So NR1 stay the same, NR2s become NR1.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3715.008s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's how I read that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3727.569s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3728.089s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for the clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3779.936s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great thank you that makes sense that the uh the boundaries between the proposed districts would have to change in any case and especially if we're contemplating this downshift for the proposal that we'll see in two weeks great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3791.947s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Luebbing, I'll recognize you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3837.881s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go to Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3950.864s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3952.004s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3953.474s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As one councilor, I think that you put that well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3956.056s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that historic conversion and being able to implement the statewide ADU law will be meaningful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3966.143s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We could go further.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3967.464s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We will go further in other areas of the city where I personally think that it makes more sense topographically, geographically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3974.688s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is that a second to the motion by President Bears?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3977.15s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3978.171s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So the motion by President Bears is seconded by Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3984.815s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is there a, sorry, was that a hand?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3987.377s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No, okay, I was imagining things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3989.499s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is there any further discussion on, President Bears's had his part, we can vote on these motions anytime.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3998.587s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any further comment by councilors on the presentation, questions, concerns, potential amendments we'd like to see in the updated draft that we'll consider for January 29th and just in my,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4012.375s">[Kit Collins]</a>: mental note-taking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4013.175s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that in addition to the changes that we'll vote on, we can also expect to see more finessed boundaries between the various sub-districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4022.2s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm also looking forward to the diagrams, the residential requirements, including not just one type of what can be built in each district, but more varied buildings that folks can envision them in context of what these neighborhoods might actually look like with the possible buildings, or perhaps already look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4058.43s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing no further hands from councillors, we have a second on both those motions from President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4065.598s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll take them in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4070.465s">[Kit Collins]</a>: read this one more time just so we can hear it and to give people time to think of potentially more motions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4075.587s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a motion by President Bears, seconded by Councilor Callahan to adjust the proposed neighborhood residential districts by removing the NR4 district type and consider that as part of urban residential topic as a potential urban residential one district, classifying all areas currently on the proposal listed as NR1 and NR2 as NR1.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4095.935s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Classifying all areas currently on the proposal listed as NR3 as NR2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4100.956s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Classifying all areas currently listed on the proposal as NR4 as NR3.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4106.637s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Adjust the NR3 district type to remove the one unit dwelling by right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4111.518s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any parcel where the current district is GR should be at least NR2 and any parcels where the current district is apartment one or apartment two should be at least NR3.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4124.063s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So on the motion by President Bears, seconded by Councilor Callahan, Councilor Scarpelli and President Bears both had to drop off so we can do a voice vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4130.668s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4131.729s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4132.41s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4134.231s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Two in favor, one opposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4135.152s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4165.394s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On the motion by President Bears, seconded by Councilor Leming, to request that the Chair work with the administration to increase accessible materials, notices, and communications about upcoming meetings and distribute them to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4177.123s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4178.223s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4178.864s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4180.365s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4186.289s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any further comments or questions from Councilors at this time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4191.213s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4193.154s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We will go to public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4194.675s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing nobody at the podium, I will go first to Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4197.397s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm going to request that you unmute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4198.938s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Please state your name and address for the record, and you will have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4286.752s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for attending tonight and for sharing that feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4289.173s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It really is duly noted and really appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4293.295s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We want to make sure that we're improving at letting the residents know about what their opportunities are to get informed about these proposals, including Salem Street, especially for abutters and neighbors so that folks can be at the meetings and be in the spaces where they can ask questions, get their questions answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4312.082s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you for raising that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4313.182s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that the current proposal<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4316.018s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4316.458s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Developed by Ennis has they were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4317.499s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that these folks were really careful about factoring in, you know, neighborhood compatibility and being thoughtful about if we're increasing height.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4324.981s">[Kit Collins]</a>: By how much under what conditions we're not going to be going into that proposal in depth tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4329.903s">[Kit Collins]</a>: However, I hope you're already aware a week from today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4333.424s">[Kit Collins]</a>: January 22nd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4334.205s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The CD board will be discussing the Salem Street proposal for the first time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4344.188s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sure it will be a really helpful overview with an opportunity for questions and answers as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4349.43s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you so much, and please continue to attend, even on the meetings that aren't specifically germane to your residence area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4355.271s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thanks for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4358.192s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Next, we'll go to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4359.572s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please, and you'll have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4371.156s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4371.776s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4583.953s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4584.854s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for the thoughtful comments, as always, Gaston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4587.935s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just to quickly respond to a couple of those, and I know, sorry, we're not supposed to go back and forth, but just since you brought it up, on the linkage piece, I think that's a really reasonable question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4596.96s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that when we look at the zoning overhaul in totality,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4602.515s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That issue becomes less because in some areas like the proposed NR1 districts, we're not encouraging developments that would be large enough to kick in the linkage fees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4614.577s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In other areas, for example, the places that are really close to the very, very high transit stations, we might be encouraging developments that would kick into the linkage fees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4625.22s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think it would have an equalizing effect, maybe not when we're just considering the neighborhood residential as a single project, but citywide,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4632.438s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know Councilor Leming, in particular, has been making sure that we're updating our linkage fees so that when we do create new zoning, especially along places like Mystic Ave, where we're encouraging big new developments, that they're gonna be paying their fair share and that their fair share is calculated correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4645.783s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you for bringing up that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4648.124s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then the other thing I was going to say was not important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4651.065s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, as always, for your thoughtful commentary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4652.966s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Madam Chair, I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4656.767s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4657.888s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4702.814s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm happy to let you finish your three minutes, and then I can respond after if you have more that you want to put on the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4709.037s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sorry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4709.778s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If you have further questions behind that, I'm happy to just give you your full time, and then I can respond afterwards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4823.686s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for your comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4825.95s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll just quickly note that all of the goals that are guiding the zoning overhaul come out of the Community Informed Housing Production Plan, Climate Action and Adaptation Plan, and Medford Comprehensive Plan, and are guided by our knowledge that Medford is a beautiful place that a lot of people live and a lot of people want to move into.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4844.644s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And people who live here are struggling to stay here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4846.646s">[Kit Collins]</a>: People who want to live here, people who grew up here and want to buy a home, people who want to stay here are struggling to find housing to do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4854.377s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Those guide the goals around thoughtfully adding densification where it makes sense in each neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4978.191s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for your comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4979.231s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I will just note that the goals of the housing production parts of the zoning overhaul, I believe, are motivated by the community's desire to build more housing, not as a revenue strategy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=4994.717s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing no further hands on Zoom, are there any further comments or motions from councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=5006.902s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Leming?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=5010.151s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Gaston, do you have an additional comment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=5011.532s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=5099.947s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sorry, would you guys just speak into the microphone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=5223.463s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=5224.384s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=5225.505s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for your questions and comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=5229.647s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=5230.127s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing no further questions or motions from Councilors, I want to again thank Innocence Associates so much for being here with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=5238.973s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Time and time again, you've done so much hard work for us over the course of the past year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=5244.136s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Emily's gesturing at Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=5245.997s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Team effort, I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=5249.246s">[Kit Collins]</a>: really shaping the goals that the community has put into our guiding documents into zoning that we can consider, discuss, deliberate, amend, and talk about in public as much as we need to and vote on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=5262.616s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=5263.837s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We will be meeting on this topic again in two weeks with an updated proposal for councilors to review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=5268.64s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I look forward to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=5272.884s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Do I hear a motion to adjourn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=5273.864s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have a motion by Councilor Callahan, seconded by Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=5279.639s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=5281.084s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=5282.247s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion passes, meeting adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=5283.832s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=765.77s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I, Kit Collins, do solemnly affirm that I will faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the duties<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=776.315s">[Kit Collins]</a>: upon me, incumbent upon me, as vice president of the Medford City Council, as vice president of the Medford City Council, according to the best of my ability, according to the best of my ability, and understanding, and understanding, agreeable to the rules and regulations of the Constitution, agreeable to the rules and regulations of the Constitution, the laws of this Commonwealth, the laws of this Commonwealth, and the ordinances of the City of Medford, and the ordinances of the City of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=803.932s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would also like to thank my colleagues for their collaboration and working with me this past year and the one ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=810.006s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=886.412s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=887.313s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a standard top of the year motion to make sure that the rules governing this body for the previous year are still in effect for the year ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=895.094s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=916.072s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=916.853s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is another standard resolution for the beginning of the calendar year to make sure that all papers that were in committee of the whole and any of the city council committees remaining committee for our discussion and perusal this calendar year motion to approve on the motion of Vice President Collins to approve seconded by Councilor Tseng all those in favor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1464.103s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to take from suspension the report of the Governance Committee on January 7th,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1890.056s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears, I would motion to suspend the rules and take the following papers out of order, 25006, 24510, 24502, and 23055.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2244.43s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2245.191s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you to my fellow Councilors for putting this on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2247.792s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And thank you, mostly, to families who are here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2251.515s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know this is really just the tip of the iceberg of the advocacy that you're doing on behalf of not just your own families, but of the entire disability community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2259.619s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Every time you advocate for your own families and your own youth's outcomes, you're advocating for the entire community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2264.062s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm very grateful to you for that and to the years of effort that have gone into this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2268.524s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When it comes to what the city can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2270.305s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's like anything else, we fund what's important to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2273.226s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a cut and dry equity issue, we need to do more to make sure that families that live in our community did not have to travel outside of our community to get the type of programming and supports and education that they or their children are entitled to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2287.533s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I look forward to continuing to work with the administration to make sure that we are putting dollars where they need to be for that to be the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4321.377s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4323.298s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As you just noted, we took our first vote on this loan order on December 17.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4327.621s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We had a committee of the whole to talk about it more in depth with climate planner Brenda Pike as well as Assistant Superintendent Cushing immediately before the 7pm meeting tonight to really go over it in detail and hear more about their extensive plans for how this will facilitate the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4344.051s">[Kit Collins]</a>: repair of the McGlynn School roof and HVAC improvements at the Andrews and McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4350.32s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this loan order would enable the funding for those roof repairs at the McGlynn and extensive HVAC at Andrews and McGlynn on a timeline that would enable the work to be completed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4359.273s">[Kit Collins]</a>: over summer vacation so that when middle schoolers return in the fall, they're doing so to buildings with repaired roofs and functioning AC and then heat in the winter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4369.603s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Really, really basic stuff that unfortunately has not been guaranteed to our middle schoolers for a long time because the HVAC has been in such dire need of repair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4378.251s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So very grateful to the hard work by those in MPS and the school department to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4386.257s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to be aligned so that this funding could come together and that the work could be done on a timeline that would allow it to be completed over the summer with minimal disruptions to education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4395.439s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'd motion to approve for third reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4774.158s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4778.602s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So the Community Control over Public Surveillance Ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4781.745s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll give a super brief recap because this is the third reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4785.107s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't wanna bore residents and Councilors who heard a very similar spiel on December 17th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4792.534s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The Community Control over Public Surveillance Ordinance or CCOPS for short, was workshopped extensively by the 2022 to 2023 City Council, the Mayor's Office and Chief Buckley over about a year and a half period that was following I think three years of advocacy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4807.649s">[Kit Collins]</a>: by civil liberties and privacy community advocates in the city of Medford, asking for such an ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4814.692s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The point of this ordinance in a nutshell, is to protect privacy and civil liberties for Medford residents by creating a robust public process through which the community has a voice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4825.316s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in decisions about when and for what reasons surveillance technology will be used by the city and for what purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4833.418s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These are expensive and nascent technologies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4835.859s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is no small thing for any city agency to use them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4840.02s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There are reasons to use them, but this is really important stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4844.52s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They're really expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4845.441s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They're really new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4846.121s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They're being aggressively marketed to communities such as ours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4849.563s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For that reason, I think it's incredibly important for the public to have a very structured, very defined, very transparent role in those discussions about if and when they should be used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4860.21s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And the CCOPS ordinance sets up that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4862.212s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It sets up a reporting process so that the community and the city council can have an active role in those decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4869.216s">[Kit Collins]</a>: To that end,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4870.797s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These tweaks are to fix some weaker areas or holes in the ordinance that were discovered in the first year or so of its implementation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4878.34s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It was passed in I think March of 2023.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4880.902s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I guess that was two years ago now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4887.024s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And these are to fix those weaker points, which is, I think, a fairly normal thing to do for a new ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4893.006s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We put it into practice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4894.106s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We see what's working really well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4895.366s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We see what we can shore up to make even stronger so that we can fulfill this ordinance's goal of maintaining really strong protections and public process for privacy and private data in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4906.329s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And specifically, they resolve omissions dealing with how improperly collected data should be disposed of to maintain the same privacy protections and closes a loophole that would allow for surveillance data to be bought or sold from or to private or commercial entities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4922.715s">[Kit Collins]</a>: With that, I would motion to approve for three reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5410.285s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5411.145s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to again thank Councilor Tseng and Councilor Leming for their work on this really important and positive ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5418.827s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I want to also thank all of the community advocates for pushing the City Council to do this, for insisting that we do this, for insisting that we be a City Council that stands up at the right time and says,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5431.69s">[Kit Collins]</a>: our community really is for everybody, and we're going to make sure that our ordinances and our policies reflect that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5436.393s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm also proud that we're a city that can pass a welcoming city ordinance and have a change policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5441.535s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Not at all, because we know from the conversations that the lead sponsors have had with administration and the chief of police that this is merely codifying the MPD's existing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5450.92s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm really proud that to pass a welcoming city ordinance actually changes our MPD policies, not one bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5458.063s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That makes me feel proud of the public safety program that we do have in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5464.525s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think I, personally, I feel really touched by that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5467.527s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I also feel really touched as a city council that the community has rallied around this to say at this moment, let's make sure that we're doing all that we can to make sure that Medford is a place that people can feel comfortable<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5479.592s">[Kit Collins]</a>: identifying as an immigrant, identifying as not being born here and still seeking out every public service that they're entitled to, including knowing that they can go to first responders, knowing that they can go to public safety officials, knowing that they can go to the MPD and be safe because they're not going to be asked about their immigration status.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5497.824s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They're not going to be asked for their paperwork.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5500.365s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And to know because it's broadcast, because it's codified as an ordinance, that we care about public safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5505.909s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We care about putting our public dollars towards public safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5509.271s">[Kit Collins]</a>: not about complying with the agendas of other states or with federal actors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5515.856s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We want to put our dollars towards public safety in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5518.518s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We mean that for everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5520.74s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I am really excited to ordain this tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5524.262s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And again, I want to thank my fellow Councilors for working closely with the administration, including working closely, I know, with the chief of police on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5531.527s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=7777.691s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for being here, Teresa and Amanda on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=7782.972s">[Kit Collins]</a>: just to echo what's already been said, shared sentiments, you know, obviously there's been so much work and effort and community input and staff effort poured into the car park renovation over many, many years at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=7795.898s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm really happy to see a unanimous recommendation come out of the CPC so that we can continue the good work of manifesting those goals and continuing the renovation project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=7805.183s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'll be really happy to support this tonight and motion for approval after any other comments or questions from my fellow Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8289.175s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8289.976s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to thank you so much for being here and for collaborating with Councilor Leming on this just really proactive, creative, common sense solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8298.762s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for being so willing to do your job, not just by the letter, but also creatively and do this kind of problem solving to utilize your existing resources to create just a really simple incentive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8311.33s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm really glad that we have a voice in City Hall, not just for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8316.694s">[Kit Collins]</a>: veterans in general and housing veterans, but also for calling out and not being willing to speak directly to the stigma that veterans face in their housing search along with other areas of life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8327.983s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So really grateful to be able to vote on this tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8331.786s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you again so much for your work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8333.848s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And also thank you, Councilor Leming, for putting this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8336.37s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I would second the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=12999.531s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13000.992s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate the thorough discussion around this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13003.492s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've heard a lot of concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13005.033s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've also heard a lot of context from the mayor and members of the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13008.594s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I wanna thank the department heads for staying on the call quite late to be on hand to answer questions around this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13017.378s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Based on what I have learned so far and heard tonight, I'm not ready to endorse the wholesale return to the status quo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13024.581s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Some things I honestly find pretty shocking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13026.302s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm shocked to hear that a timesheet system wasn't in place for hourly employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13030.765s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm really glad that's been fixed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13032.185s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's probably about 30 years late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13033.666s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's something that's for everybody's protection, employees included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13040.951s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Based on what I'm hearing, it's not clear to me that the new system is any less safe or more expensive, or that there's been cases where qualified decision makers haven't been available, or that it means less availability for qualified inspectors when they're needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13055.221s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This sounds to me like a case of new best practices being promulgated by our new building commissioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13060.544s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I am very grateful that there are contingencies for when Commissioner van der Waal isn't available to field calls, and I find it hard to get angry about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13069.47s">[Kit Collins]</a>: former Commissioner 40 being paid $240 over the past year to be a knowledgeable backup.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13075.371s">[Kit Collins]</a>: With that in mind, I'm gonna find it hard to vote yes on the paper as submitted this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13080.793s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have a suggested amendment that I'd like to offer instead, or if the councilor is not amenable to it, I'll offer it as a B paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13087.434s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that we've gotten some helpful info to serve as context for this issue tonight, and I think it'd be helpful to have it in writing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13095.056s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that amendment or B paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13097.327s">[Kit Collins]</a>: would be, whereas public safety is a priority for the City Council, be it resolved that the administration submit a report detailing new overtime policies within the building department, as well as a report on current policies relating to building department and fire department hierarchy of oversight and decision making on incidents involving building structures after business hours, along with written answers to Councilor Scarpelli's questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13121.137s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13150.663s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13151.143s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I'll read it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13152.644s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Whereas public safety is a priority for the city council, be it resolved that the administration support, submit a report detailing new overtime policies within the building department, as well as a report on current policies relating to building department and fire department hierarchy of oversight and decision-making on incidents involving building structures after business hours, along with written answers to your questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13211.62s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, I'll submit it as a B paper instead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=13213.362s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for considering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=14011.189s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The paper is whereas public safety is a priority for the City Council, be it resolved that the administration submit a report detailing new overtime policies within the building department, as well as a report on current policies relating to building department and fire department hierarchy of oversight and decision making on incidents involving building structures after business hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15358.8s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15359.52s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for being here with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15360.841s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for sticking it out this long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15362.401s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We apologize for keeping you here so late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15364.742s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know like many others in the community, it was really sad to hear when the porch vacated its current tenancy and really excited to hear that something new is moving in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15373.586s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sure that many jokes will be made about the new establishment at the establishment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15377.867s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you for providing a really easy conversation starter for your future patrons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15385.37s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No further questions, I'd happily motion to approve or second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15778.244s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's a really beautiful question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15779.726s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's a question on a lot of people's minds on both sides of the rail, I think that there's been a lot of strategies that have been tried by the city council and maybe also modeled by the school committee, not endorsing any one or the other, for example, I believe, maybe still are used to the school committee had a rule that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15794.898s">[Kit Collins]</a>: they do the regular agenda until a certain time of the night and at that time maybe when the clock strikes nine or ten then they say are we going to table all remaining items or are we not i don't quote me on that it's just something that i think was present at their rules at some time again i'm not endorsing that but i think everybody kind of feels this tension in between we have to have these meetings after business hours so that people can participate and because we start at 7 p.m that kind of creates a funneling effect on the other side<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15822.757s">[Kit Collins]</a>: as well, because not everybody can stay here until 11 12 one in the morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15827.843s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've, we've tried mitigating you know how long people can speak for so that more people can speak to kind of keep things moving I know that's also been, you know, weighing of a cost and benefit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15837.974s">[Kit Collins]</a>: there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15838.755s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, if you can, uh, I know you're kind of a stem person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15842.018s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If you can develop an A I that can combine what's on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15845.721s">[Kit Collins]</a>: People's moods of Councilor Scarpelli has sent any mass emails recently and, you know, create a model of what we can expect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=15852.547s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'd love to see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/92ZcNcBM_Nk&t=830.761s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Present<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/92ZcNcBM_Nk&t=1318.811s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/92ZcNcBM_Nk&t=1320.232s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know there's been a lot of people who have put a lot of work into this document so far, and it's exciting to be at this stage in the process where we can review kind of an interim result from those many months, I mean, more than months, years of work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/92ZcNcBM_Nk&t=1335.121s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we have to take into account the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/92ZcNcBM_Nk&t=1338.044s">[Kit Collins]</a>: years of advocacy for an updated charter that resulted in the process that we're now a part of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/92ZcNcBM_Nk&t=1342.847s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that's really exciting to see how this is progressing, exciting to have it before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/92ZcNcBM_Nk&t=1348.29s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it is quite a lot to go through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/92ZcNcBM_Nk&t=1352.192s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Over the past couple of weeks, I've been going through section by section and just noting notes and questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/92ZcNcBM_Nk&t=1358.295s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think the way to break this down, I think the framing to me makes a lot of sense of thinking about what is closest to our work as a body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/92ZcNcBM_Nk&t=1366.44s">[Kit Collins]</a>: what do we really require meeting with other bodies, the school committee, other department heads on to get that context from how it affects their work and structuring how we'll go through this document, structuring a timeline around that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/92ZcNcBM_Nk&t=1383.266s">[Kit Collins]</a>: At the same time, I know that we have a pretty strict timeline if we want the legislature to be able to take up the final result of our action this term, which I know we very much do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/92ZcNcBM_Nk&t=1394.23s">[Kit Collins]</a>: we have to make sure that we're doing all of this work on a pretty timely pace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/92ZcNcBM_Nk&t=1398.574s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think that this is ambitious, but I think that it's doable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/92ZcNcBM_Nk&t=1400.856s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is going to be a very major project for the City Council this spring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/92ZcNcBM_Nk&t=1403.739s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it will become apparent to us as we go through these first three meetings, if we need any additional input, if we need any additional time on, you know, for example, the more technical procedural<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/92ZcNcBM_Nk&t=1417.725s">[Kit Collins]</a>: things at the end if we run out of time for those because we're talking about the more substantive governance related topics with the call and sender.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/92ZcNcBM_Nk&t=1426.411s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think this is doable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/92ZcNcBM_Nk&t=1427.552s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that this is a, this is an area where, you know, we can say as a city council, we know that we have to allocate a lot of resources to this project over the next three or four months, because it has a really, you know, because it has a really defined<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/92ZcNcBM_Nk&t=1439.676s">[Kit Collins]</a>: timeline on it, but I like the way you've laid it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/92ZcNcBM_Nk&t=1442.499s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it makes sense to talk about the sections that impact the City Council most directly first, certainly the ones that I flipped to first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/92ZcNcBM_Nk&t=1453.472s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that, you know, not to say that it's the only section that's germane to our work,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/92ZcNcBM_Nk&t=1458.776s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Most of the highlighting that I did was in the executive section around financial procedures and the annual budgeting process, and that affects our work very intimately as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/92ZcNcBM_Nk&t=1468.06s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it makes sense to give ourselves and city staff a little bit more time to get together our notes and our questions for that meeting in February.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/92ZcNcBM_Nk&t=1476.204s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That'll be a very substantive one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/92ZcNcBM_Nk&t=1477.425s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think this is a great plan to start out with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/92ZcNcBM_Nk&t=1485.548s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And thank you for your work in structuring it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/92ZcNcBM_Nk&t=1590.523s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/92ZcNcBM_Nk&t=1591.083s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, and just another note on timeline I'm thinking as I'm looking over the list thinking about, you know, what are the topics that we're going to have the heaviest discussion about and what are the topics that the public is most likely to be have the most questions about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/92ZcNcBM_Nk&t=1603.351s">[Kit Collins]</a>: be most keenly interested in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/92ZcNcBM_Nk&t=1605.612s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Obviously, they're spread throughout this timeline, but I could see, especially with the proposed changes to board representation and at-large representation, I think it makes sense to have elections not be the very first thing that we take up to give people time to save the day, to know to turn out, because that is a change that I know a lot of people have been advocating for, that people will want to be able to have noticed before that discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=355.574s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=495.932s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=500.376s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this is, I'm just really grateful for the opportunity that the governing agenda and the biannual review presents us with to take a step back and look at the year in total.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=514.686s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that for myself, it's really easy to get caught up in the day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month work and lose track of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=525.666s">[Kit Collins]</a>: kind of a big picture of which big projects have advanced incrementally, which things have come together over the course of a lot of months of work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=535.455s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also find that it's really easy to forget about things that we did, substantive as they may be, because this Council has been extraordinarily productive, busy, and prolific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=546.426s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I thank all of my colleagues for collaborating to make that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=550.855s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The reality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=551.456s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is just my second term on the city council, but our committees have been much more active than they ever have been in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=560.103s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that every Councilor has been really diligent about Using the committee structure to make sure that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=568.672s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We articulated big goals in the governing agenda at the beginning of this year, and we've been very thorough about meeting on those and pushing forward our priorities in our various public meetings systemically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=585.118s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that a lot of that progress, at least for me as an individual, would actually be pretty hard to just get a bird's eye view on if not for this document so that we can compare<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=595.342s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Kind of our goals and hopes and dreams and plans January version to where we are 11 months later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=603.65s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm just, I'm really grateful for this format, which allows us to kind of compare how we started and what we've made progress on and even the projects that we've completed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=611.038s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=614.611s">[Kit Collins]</a>: really grateful to my colleagues for their work on our shared larger projects and our individual projects that different people have taken point on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=622.199s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, all of the projects in the governing agenda come from things that we heard from the community, things from our constituents, things that people in the community wanted to see, want us to see us working on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=633.49s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's why we're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=634.191s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's why we do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=635.472s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm really glad that we have a document that we could point to and say<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=638.895s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is why this was a goal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=640.457s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is why this is a goal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=641.899s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And this is what this is what we're working on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=643.682s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And this is why this is why we're working for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=646.405s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that's really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=649.449s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, in our.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=650.99s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then the word gets used a lot, but I think it really is a valuable goal to try to make the work of the council more transparent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=658.597s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And to me, that just means using more and better tools and language to describe to people what it is that we do in meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=665.103s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a way to break it down and show people how long it takes to get from A to B on a variety of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=671.589s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So looking forward to just a quick review tonight, and then we'll do that again in six months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=676.534s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=734.772s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, and I'll just take that opportunity to note that it was President Bears' idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1808.953s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, you saw me raise and lower my hand because I wasn't sure if this was worth putting out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1812.454s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But just for the benefit of residents who may be watching this update meeting, just to be clear, we're not going to change the disposition of any of these papers in this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1822.378s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're not going to take anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1823.999s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're not going to remove anything from committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1825.539s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're not going to fully<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1827.18s">[Kit Collins]</a>: dispel with any papers, even though we might discuss what is likely to happen with them in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1831.421s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is to just give a general overview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1833.601s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So for folks wondering, you know, when will the next step take place?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1837.002s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When will official action take place?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1839.403s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Not in this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1840.263s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any papers even that we're going to take off the docket, they would have to be reviewed and placed on file from the committee that they're currently in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1848.165s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just wanted to note that for clarity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2310.69s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2311.111s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, totally just echoing what was said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2313.452s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just to reinforce the point, I know that the mayor's team has been doing a pretty good job of cataloging<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2322.285s">[Kit Collins]</a>: exactly what our ARPA expenditures have been and breaking those down by category.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2327.25s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also do know and I don't think it's at all true that we're going to be leaving ARPA money on the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2331.694s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that this was a fairly, you know, it's close to the end of the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2335.467s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that the reallocation back to ARPA was made because of the revenue replacement from the Prop 2.5 override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2341.63s">[Kit Collins]</a>: However, there were also some pretty late-breaking major expenditures that we did use ARPA funding for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2346.612s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I just don't think it's, I don't, people shouldn't worry that we're leaving our ARPA monies on the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2569.48s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2572.442s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well, zoning wasn't literally the only thing that we did in this committee, but it was overwhelmingly the work of this committee so far this year and will remain the case next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2582.407s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We had, I honestly, I gave up on counting the number of zoning meetings that we had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2587.389s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think President Bears might have the number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2589.09s">[Kit Collins]</a>: 16 so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2595.425s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would have guessed even higher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2598.606s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We began meeting with Innes Associates very, very close to the top of the year, initially kind of mapping out our work plan for the comprehensive review of the city's zoning ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2610.872s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that was kind of a project in and of itself, because we knew that we wanted to talk about some citywide zoning approaches, some tweaks that would affect<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2619.355s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the whole community, and that we also wanted to go neighborhood by neighborhood or geography by geography, as the zoning consultants often refer to it in their language of planning consultants, so that we could consider both, you know, on really a street-by-street, neighborhood-by-neighborhood level, what do we know that the community wants for this neighborhood based on all of the research and community feedback that we have gathered?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2645.416s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in the past, and especially through projects like the comprehensive planning process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2650.82s">[Kit Collins]</a>: How do we make these more localized changes to manifest what we know people want?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2655.862s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then what are the changes that it makes sense to consider as a unit citywide, things around housing incentives,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2668.396s">[Kit Collins]</a>: parking, et cetera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2670.157s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So breaking down how those pieces might work together so that we could get through all of our goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2676.482s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We got our feet wet with some technical changes at the beginning of the year, updating our definitions, making some changes around site plan review that were really important on the city side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2686.99s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And one of my personal favorites, taking the vote so that the official zoning map of Medford is no longer paper and colored pencil, but an actual GIS digital file, which I think is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2697.998s">[Kit Collins]</a>: pretty cool for 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2700.743s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Since then, in July, we really dove into kind of the meat of the project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2705.452s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We had a really cool mapping workshop<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2708.686s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in July, which I think set us up for our kind of geography by geography work that will carry us through June of 2025 or later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2715.868s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The zoning consultant prepared a lot of different kind of aerial views that showcase different characteristics around Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2723.37s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We looked at topography, we looked at flood zones, we looked at density, we looked at demography, we looked at traffic, so many different ways to think about what our places feel like and got a lot of interesting feedback there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2736.514s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've been applying all of this to our geographies work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2739.935s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We started with the Mystic Ave Corridor District, which we just ordained last night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2746.216s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We had many, many meetings on that in committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2748.977s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I went to City Council, I went to the Community Development Board, came back to the City Council last night, and it's been ordained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2755.178s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The Salem Street Corridor District was the next geography in the queue, and that one is about midway through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2763.12s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well, a little bit more than midway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2764.24s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've had a couple meetings about it in committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2767.921s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It was just referred to the Community Development Board last night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2770.562s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They'll be holding public hearings on that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2773.882s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Abutters, I think, should be getting notices in mid-January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2776.903s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know the planning staff is planning to send out those notices after Christmas so that doesn't get lost in Christmas mail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2783.404s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So there'll be more public hearings about the Salem Street Corrector District, and then I'll come back to the City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2789.145s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And towards the end of this year we've also been mapping out our plan for for what's next for what geographies, what neighborhoods will be turned to next, I don't have this memorized off the top of my head, but I'm pretty sure that at the beginning of the year, we will be looking at, I think we'll be turning to South Medford and hillsides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2807.82s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then later in the year, we'll be turning our focus towards North Medford, West Medford, Wellington, Medford Square, not in that order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2818.206s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But we are going to make sure that we keep a pace so that we can do a really thorough review and update of the zoning in all of Medford's neighborhoods, and then kind of widen the scope again and consider those broader topics that we really want to not consider piece by piece, but think about the whole community in one discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2838.663s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that's zoning where that's, you know, that's a three minute version of zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2842.646s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears, would you mind scrolling down?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2844.088s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think there were a couple other ordinance projects that I wanted to, oh, right, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2847.691s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Green score also subsumed within zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2850.733s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This was something that we reported out kind of in between Mystic Avenue Corridor District and Salem Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2858.04s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is one of those citywide strategies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2862.243s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, Greenscore is, in a nutshell, it's a rubric that, um, is comprised of our existing building development standards, you know, when you develop in Medford, you know, what, what you have to do, specifications that you need, um, to build by, to be acceptable, to be approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2879.928s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, and it also encompasses some newer and more ambitious environmental standards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2885.19s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it also includes, um, not just environmental standards, but also community amenities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2890.952s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that we can be encouraging developers to be adding in more of the things that we want to see into their projects, things like sidewalk improvements, things like parks, things like shade, hydration stations, and rewarding them when they do add those amenities into their projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2907.364s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then I'll also mention transportation demand management is an ordinance that's been brought up by councillors Leming and saying so that we can kind of this is a policy where we're in we can take a holistic look at transportation options in the city and also in the region.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2926.048s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and set up a community-wide policy to be making sure that as new development comes in, development options are streamlined and that we can be encouraging developers to help us further streamline and build our transportation system as they're adding to our built environment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2945.974s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If you'll scroll down just a bit, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2952.796s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2954.177s">[Kit Collins]</a>: To round this out,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2955.925s">[Kit Collins]</a>: some of the other things in this committee, the condo conversion ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2959.347s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is an ordinance that I proposed last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2961.629s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's kind of in stasis right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2965.792s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It doesn't totally fit in within the zoning work, so it's kind of on the back burner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2969.834s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I'm hopeful that we can advance this in 2025, because this is another strategy that would help us maintain<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2977.363s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2977.423s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Maintain rental units as they are in Medford instead of seeing more of our housing stock being converted to unaffordable luxury housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2984.186s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In this committee are also some of our housing home world petitions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2988.648s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um in 2022 President Bears and I proposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2992.27s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um that the council look at a tenant first rate of refusal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=2995.571s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Normal petition as well as a rent stabilization and no fault eviction<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3004.375s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The rent stabilization and no fault eviction protections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3006.679s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We had one initial meeting on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3008.723s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think just one initial meeting on this over the summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3011.928s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We haven't returned to it yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3013.01s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This has been a very busy committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3014.473s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I am hopeful that we could pick up this project again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3017.965s">[Kit Collins]</a>: uh, early in 2025, especially when the new state legislative session resumes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3023.567s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, the real estate transfer fee Home Rule petition was also referred to the Planning and Permitting Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3029.689s">[Kit Collins]</a>: However, uh, before we met on it in committee, we did learn that the Affordable, uh, Homes Act at the state level did not include, um, the transfer fee, uh, as an op- as a, um, local option within it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3043.314s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So outlook is grim for this strategy at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3048.669s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just finally, we will also review few schedules for a germane to the planning and permitting committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3056.07s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have the goal of reviewing a cycling safety ordinance to kind of adhere to and strengthen the city's existing complete streets policies and plans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3067.813s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are hoping to, and then we have a number of other projects, including energy disclosure and other, I think there's,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3078.235s">[Kit Collins]</a>: scroll down here on my own copy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3083.359s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have several other<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3086.616s">[Kit Collins]</a>: permitting and building related projects that I think could all cohere pretty well with the zoning work that we're doing, such as energy disclosure, benchmarking ordinance, which kind of go along with us trying to better work hand in hand with especially large developers to make sure that they're doing their part to help us know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3110.029s">[Kit Collins]</a>: how we are doing at progressing towards our energy efficiency goals and our climate mitigation and adaptation goals and give us the data that we need to hold these large developers in these large buildings accountable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3123.123s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There was also the rental licensing ordinance referred into this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3127.327s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that this is a really valuable proposal that would help city staff do a lot of the work that we're talking about when it comes to making sure that we're having good communication with property owners in the city so that we can be working together on everything from energy efficiency to retrofits to making sure that tenants are getting the information that they need from the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3145.482s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we haven't had a chance to work on this in committee yet, but I'm hopeful that we will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3153.166s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then finally, these are two ordinances proposed by Councilor Tseng, pesticide regulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3158.828s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know this is important to many folks in the community, as well as blasting and earth removal regulations, which I think the goal of that would be to prohibit future Winthrop Street style disturbances where developers are able to do really loud, disruptive earth removal and blasting without a lot of controls on the city side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3183.448s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, and then just around this out quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3185.71s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oversight and engagement wise if we ever get free time in this committee, which I doubt which will, which I doubt will happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3191.776s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We will review other relevant city organises and regulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3196.0s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, Councilors Garpelli as the chair of the License, Providing and Sign Application Subcommittee continues to, um, meet on these topics when needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3209.281s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then I think we're also hoping to fold in energy retrofits for existing buildings into our overall work around large building and potentially small building accountability and collaboration on our climate goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3226.091s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Quite enough for one committee, I would say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3227.672s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll leave it there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3376.18s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would just say, well, I would say in general, I think if this meeting is a great time to mention things and I can, as the co-editor of this document, I'm happy to make flags and we can make sure that things are, that this document is fully updated with the full scope of what we're working on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3391.65s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sure that I missed some stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3393.571s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I did make sure to note in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3399.019s">[Kit Collins]</a>: under public works and facilities committee, there is a project about street and sidewalk repair and accessibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3403.401s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I did make sure to at least note that advocacy that's been going on from the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3409.085s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Lazzaro, and thank you for your leadership on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3607.209s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3609.172s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Give me a second to get situated, colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3615.125s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, we have three more committees to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3616.626s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would respectfully request that, and I'll first do a disclaimer about my own hypocrisy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3622.508s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know I went long in my committee and my defense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3624.509s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We meet twice a month instead of once a month or less.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3629.051s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But if we could try to speed run the updates on the remaining three committees, because I also have a appointment I have to get to soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3641.254s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let me just find where we were, and then I'll share my screen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3648.082s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The first can take public participation on the, I guess, most recent on the public and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3657.674s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well, doesn't matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3658.995s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I forget what committee we just went over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3660.576s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Gaston, just for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3662.518s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3730.785s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3731.305s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3731.906s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I really appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3733.266s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I agree when it comes to something is important, but thorny to implement as bike lanes really important to get all stakeholders in the room early in the game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3743.692s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I will make a note to add the cycling safety, sorry, the cycling master plan to the helpful links, a section of the document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3751.736s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3753.116s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, let me share my screen and we'll go to Councilor Lazzaro for presentation on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3762.619s">[Kit Collins]</a>: projects in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=3927.174s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Community control over public surveillance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4049.622s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Chair Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4050.583s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just to, if I might, just to add here, I know that your committee has been the home for a lot of my ordinances this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4058.848s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you for support on those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4060.769s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I also want to, you know, a lot of those related to the Overgrowth Ordinance, the Rural Control Ordinance, the Wildlife Feeding Ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4067.434s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this is the committee in which we are doing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4070.996s">[Kit Collins]</a>: work to try to respond to community concerns about our escalating population.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4076.217s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've been working closely with the health director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4079.718s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you for always making space and time for this committee for us to advance those projects so we can do a better job for the human constituents of Medford and a harsher job for the world of constituents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4098.623s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I forgot how to phrase that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4108.507s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, on to the Public Works and Facilities Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4111.089s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Callahan, take it away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4236.987s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4237.227s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The update is that there is no update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4239.248s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is something that I would like to do, but I think this is something that I would not take committee capacity for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4246.983s">[Kit Collins]</a>: over other projects necessarily next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4249.265s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So if we do have one of those sessions to review papers and committee and see what might not occur in 2025, what maybe should be disposed of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4258.031s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Unless there is a groundswell of support from the community, this might be something that is not a priority item for next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4385.086s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4390.05s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm also excited for the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4392.731s">[Kit Collins]</a>: tree planting volunteer network.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4395.553s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, on to our final committee to review resident services and public engagement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4399.877s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Another prolific one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4401.558s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Leming, your quick update, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4596.643s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4596.883s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4599.123s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And like I mentioned, this has been another really remarkably prolific committee, and I do want to commend you as chair for your leadership in all of the work to modernize City Council communications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4611.126s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I mean, just saying it like that, it doesn't sound like as much of an effort as it has been.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4615.087s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But, you know, piloting a city council newsletter, getting the meetings accessible on YouTube, which for some people is easier than Medford Community Media, and they're available instead of a couple days later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4626.839s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Obviously, not a pejorative on MCM.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4632.184s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We love that service as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4633.185s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's very vital.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4635.107s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But the proliferation of ways that people can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4639.222s">[Kit Collins]</a>: about what's happening on the City Council and read about it and go more into depth if they want or just get the bite-sized version is a really stark contrast to previous years when there were very, very, very few ways to know what the City Council was doing and ways to digest that information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4653.768s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think this committee is to be commended for their many meetings to work on those projects as well as the City Council Residence Guide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4663.491s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that these are things that have been really appreciated by a lot of people who have joined us in the chambers<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4671.141s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that takes us to the end of this document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4677.505s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I did note the two things that you mentioned in this committee that were not included on the governing agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4681.787s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I will make sure to update those along with our other additions and updates to the documents so that we can get a clean as of end of December 2024 version to circulate and to have online on the city council portal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4697.439s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I believe we're also going to take a look in terms of other updates to this document before we promulgate the next clean version.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4702.882s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we're also going to update those Spreadsheet calendars for each committee and make sure that those are still up to date and reflective of the current information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4712.546s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A final edit that I will do is going back and updating the table of contents, which I'm not sure has been<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4719.369s">[Kit Collins]</a>: accurate now that we have added a lot of projects and changed the status of a lot of projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4725.072s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we can, you can expect those edits in coming weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4733.656s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just want to thank my colleagues for their work on this document and their help<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4740.629s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to me and updating it and for all of the work that's gone into the projects that it gives an overview on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4747.891s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm really grateful for your hard work and your diligence and your willingness to be in the city call chambers twice a week, almost all weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4758.495s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Appreciate your partnership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4760.416s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any other comments to add?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4771.263s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go ahead, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4818.885s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4820.106s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And yes, I want to echo your words of gratitude to the clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4824.069s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4830.873s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's really grateful for the collaboration that we've shared this year and very genuinely looking forward to collaborating with you all in the new year and excited to see how the governing agenda looks in another six months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4846.238s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and as always, yes, thank you for mentioning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4849.02s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Always appreciate the residents that take the time out of their week to be engaged in this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4853.644s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Please join us, continue to join us in the new year, share your feedback, join these meetings, bring your friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4859.929s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That is the point, that is the goal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4862.672s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We appreciate you being here and paying attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4869.397s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Do I hear any motions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4872.2s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to adjourn by Councilor Leming, seconded by<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4875.882s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Callahan, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll when you're ready.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4881.483s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, we're gonna keep the paper in committee and adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4883.384s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4911.136s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4912.398s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Meeting adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=969.633s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=970.534s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you as well, Councilor Scarpelli for putting this on and making sure that we properly recognized Director Kerr for her 40 incredible years leading the Medford Public Library.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=981.841s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, a lot great has been said about Barbara.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=985.223s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We could go on all night just talking about Barbara, but what really strikes me about her from all the meetings we've had with her over the past three years is she brings<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=993.007s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Obviously, so much skill so much knowledge so much experience to run the library and she's been doing this for four decades and she's made sure that our library remains contemporary over the years and she really fought to make sure that we can now enjoy a public modern contemporary public library and.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1009.744s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, some people know really well just how, just how much hard work and advocacy and how many risks it took to make it the incredible, you know, really model library that it is today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1020.032s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we can't thank her enough, not just for the recent, you know, really, really visible accomplishments, but for all of the work that preceded that to bring us to the community space that we get to enjoy and that we'll get to enjoy for so many years to come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1030.76s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you, Barbara.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1031.901s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We could truly go on all night talking about her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1034.083s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1205.966s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears, I would motion to adjoin reports of committees and approve the single motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1254.087s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1255.348s">[Kit Collins]</a>: At the December 3rd Planning and Permitting Committee meeting, we met once again with our zoning consultant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1260.05s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We discussed a draft plan for 2025, and we had the first introduction before this committee to the proposed zoning for the Salem Street Corridor District.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1269.456s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1360.506s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1361.286s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This was another meeting with the zoning consultant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1363.567s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We had our second meeting on the proposed zoning for the Salem Street Corridor District, and it was referred out to City Council for the next procedural step, which is referral to the Community Development Board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1404.861s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1405.562s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would motion to suspend the rules to take from the table paper 24-494 for third reading, followed by communications from the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1933.837s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1934.537s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for being with us tonight and thank you for being with the school committee yesterday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1938.718s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know it's a really busy time of year, but it's really exciting to see that this project is being pushed forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1945.9s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've been hearing about the HVAC issues in Medford Public Schools for a really long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1951.701s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It feels like forever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1953.001s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it's exciting to be at a point where we can be talking about pre-implementation and implementation of the projects that will<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1960.923s">[Kit Collins]</a>: allow the schools to remain the comfortable temperatures that students can learn and thrive in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1967.346s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Before any motions are made, I'd be eager to hear that kind of like brief synopsis about the bird's eye view, why now to kind of get our heads around the urgency around this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1977.711s">[Kit Collins]</a>: To me, we've been hearing from parents and educators for such a long time about the really severe heating and cooling issues in the Medford public schools that I feel pretty comfortable taking a vote on this ASAP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1987.715s">[Kit Collins]</a>: but I'd like to hear your presentation first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1989.436s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1989.956s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Or the short form your presentation first, to be clear, not the hour long version.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1993.318s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2452.438s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for the presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2454.02s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for the succinctness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2457.743s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Certainly, I don't think that any of us think that our students and educators and school staff should be put in the position of having to beg for classrooms that are a temperature at which you can focus and deliver good education and learn and be comfortable enough to get through the day and really get something out of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2472.857s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the education that Medford Public Schools offers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2476.298s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I would be really happy to work with President Bears to make sure that we can get a committee of the whole on the January schedule as quickly as possible so that we can advance this tonight, if it is the will of the council, do our due diligence, and then try to get this out the door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2488.703s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Because I do understand, you know, I think anybody who has any passing familiarity with projects of this scale, you know, I know that we have a really tight timeframe that you're trying to get this done in so that these improvements are up and running for the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2500.167s">[Kit Collins]</a>: of the next school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2501.248s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And if we miss that window, that manifests in unhappy students and unhappy educators and unhappy families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2507.534s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So with that, I would motion to approve for first reading and for city council leadership to work to schedule a committee of the whole for more in-depth conversation at our first opportunity in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2948.485s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2948.805s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Before we vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2949.346s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanted to appreciate my Councilor discussion of this item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2952.59s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm very much looking forward to the committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2954.713s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also just wanted to follow up and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2957.571s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to make clear just because of the way that it's being talked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2961.334s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a request for a loan order for $5 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2966.057s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't want people to come away with the impression that the city is, after this vote, writing a check for $5 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2971.081s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's not the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2972.722s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The loan order, you know, this is a process that we very, very, very commonly use for large capital expenses like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2979.327s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is normal to take out a loan order for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2981.288s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's like the way this is normally done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2982.769s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're not just writing a check from some<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2985.491s">[Kit Collins]</a>: city checking account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2986.372s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's not how this works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2987.992s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, and I just, you know, I've had so many conversations with constituents about heating and cooling in MPS buildings for so many years that I really would be remiss to not just affirm that this is not a new project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=2999.437s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is really a harm that people have been feeling for years, and I'm glad that we're acting on it now, but we're actually we're acting on it late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3007.18s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you for getting us to this point where we can be acting on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=3010.362s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4068.971s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4069.711s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Commissioner McGibbon for being with us this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4072.432s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that the lead line replacement rebate program is something that I've heard a lot about from a lot of constituents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4078.715s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think there's a lot of enthusiasm for this program as homeowners are really happy to know that there are rebates available for replacing lead lines that really ought to be replaced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4088.138s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you for your work on that program in general.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4092.26s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that this is a really worthy program and it makes sense to use monies from the Water and Sewer Stabilization Fund, which, you know, is a way of making sure that our retained earnings can remain useful throughout the year to be put towards this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4103.488s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it sounds to me like it's, you know, essentially just a stopgap, a kind of safety measure until hopefully some federal monies start to augment that program as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4115.396s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I would happy to make a motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=4117.598s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5005.253s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5006.134s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate the discussion being put forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5008.697s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do wish that these topics were separated into disparate resolutions so we could take them up individually and vote on them individually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5013.862s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A lot to get into here, but I do just feel that we need to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5020.569s">[Kit Collins]</a>: be more clear with the language that we're using.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5022.871s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I didn't want people to use, I wouldn't want people to leave the meeting thinking that the city has offered the superintendent a buyout.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5029.977s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's not accurate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5031.018s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's my understanding again, we are not the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5033.3s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think that we should be taking up matters that are germane to the school committee because that is not our body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5038.164s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, but it is my understanding that it is pretty common when a superintendent contract is not renewed that the superintendent does step back from the full extent of their responsibilities before their contract is officially over to allow for that transition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5052.774s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This isn't abnormal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5053.814s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It doesn't indicate that there's any sort of expensive<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5058.314s">[Kit Collins]</a>: illicit, fraudulent buyout going on, I think that this is normal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5062.436s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I want to put that out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5063.856s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I wouldn't, you know, I know that sometimes using these words makes for better TV, but I don't think that it's respectful to the residents to mischaracterize what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=5073.78s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7643.407s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7644.988s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would note that it wouldn't be my preference to rule 21 this resolution, but I do think that we should separate it out into at least four resolutions and then proceed from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7656.215s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The first four lines as one resolution, and then the next four paragraphs as one resolution each, and we should, that would be my preference to go from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7976.102s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7977.242s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My proposal would be to sever into four resolutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7984.483s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The first one comprising the first four lines, the second one being the second paragraph, or sorry, the fifth line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7991.718s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The third one being the second to last paragraph and the fourth one being the last paragraph.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8016.956s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8070.009s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10100.316s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10100.816s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10102.858s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I do appreciate the discussion, the clarity around the noticing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10105.881s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think especially with these zoning ordinances, I think the process is clear, but it's complicated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10110.926s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's one of those things that is wonky and technical and it has to procedurally, legally, it must kind of go from body to body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10118.493s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think it's really understandable that, you know, there's for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10122.984s">[Kit Collins]</a>: folks who aren't intimately familiar with the zoning referral process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10126.13s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's not intuitive, and that makes a lot of sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10128.915s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And due to, you know, continued collaboration, especially between members of the planning and permitting committee,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10134.778s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're kind of continually trying to make sure that we're messaging these meetings ever better and making it easier for folks to know where we are in the process and I think that this is an easy thing that we can add to kind of the increased levels of communication and flyering that we're doing around our ongoing zoning work just to try and do what we can to make this important, technical, complicated, you know, very interesting process a little more legible for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10159.04s">[Kit Collins]</a>: just regular folks in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10161.902s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Having said that, just if you'll indulge me for just a little bit of retrospective before I make a motion, really excited that Mystic Avenue Corridor District zoning proposal has come back to the City Council tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10174.671s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's taken, you know, as with any zoning proposal, it's taken a thorough and storied road to get here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10182.176s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We had a mapping workshop back in July.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10184.217s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We decided that Mystic Avenue Corridor District was going to be one of the first things that we took a deep dive into because, you know, between our housing production plan, between our comprehensive plan, from so many comments that me and my colleagues have received from constituents over the years talking about just, it's so visible, I think for so many people, the untapped potential on Mystic Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10205.665s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that the kind of, there was a very clear vision for how we could do more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10211.334s">[Kit Collins]</a>: even more with this really valuable property in Medford and Leverage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10215.515s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's a transit corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10217.235s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's some really big lots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10218.896s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's good for a lot of things and we should be doing more with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10221.436s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This council has been really focused on doing what we can to try and set the stage for more commercial development so that we are building our commercial tax base as much as possible and having that trickle into things like schools and roads and public services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10236.559s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we began our discussions of the Mystic Avenue Corridor District in August.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10240.282s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We workshopped it for a couple months with city staff, with our zoning consultant in committee, receiving feedback from the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10248.467s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We looked at a lot of different options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10250.148s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We took in feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10251.108s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We made tweaks after committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10252.909s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It was referred to the Community Development Board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10254.71s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It came back to us tonight with some recommendations to just further tweak it and make it<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10262.859s">[Kit Collins]</a>: more legible for developers, make more sense, be easier to understand, and just be easier to achieve some of the requirements, incentives that we're really hoping that developers will take us up on on Mystic App, so that we'll both get great development along Mystic App that's in the line of what the community really wants to see there, but is also, you know, simple and clear enough that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10284.733s">[Kit Collins]</a>: People can look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10285.614s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Residents can look at it and developers can look at and say, OK, it's obvious to me what they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10290.381s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's obvious to me how to meet these requirements so that we can partner with the city to do more on this to have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10300.555s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Having said that, I think, you know, happy to have more of a discussion on the specific amendments that the CD board is recommending that we adopt tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10309.584s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They are in our packets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10311.305s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think they're pretty straightforward and intuitive tweaks, but I would motion to approve for first reading the Mystic Avenue Corridor District zoning proposal and adopt the recommended amendments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=10325.078s">[Kit Collins]</a>: by the Community Development Board, as well as to change the special permit granting authority on cannabis uses to the ZBA and to change the special permit granting authority on adult uses to the City Council to maintain consistency with the rest of the zoning ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12030.421s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12033.103s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll keep it brief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12033.904s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have a lot to say about this proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12035.225s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm really proud of it, really grateful to all of the staff, the Planning, Development and Sustainability Office that worked on it with us and the zoning consultant and continues to work on it with us and really laid the groundwork for this and other zoning proposals with work in the community over the course of years to really gather the information and the desires from the community that inform<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12057.543s">[Kit Collins]</a>: what we're doing here, what we know that people want to see around Medford, and how to articulate that in the, yes, rather sterile, but incredibly impactful language of zoning, which when you look at the proposals, looks, you know, if you were like me, not a zoning lawyer, it looks like nothing at first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12078.858s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But if you're one of those people who wants to know more and wants to know how our community values, or just you know what you want to see in your community is showing up in the zoning proposals I really do implore you to join us at our planning and permitting committee meetings where this work will be will continue throughout the rest of the fiscal year and possibly beyond that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12095.415s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We usually meet twice a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12097.577s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Please do join us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12099.359s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also, and I'm sorry, but just a really minor point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12101.92s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's not the case that you can never ever have a drive-through on Mystic Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12106.043s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In the commercial district, you could apply for a special permit through the CDB.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12109.505s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just a, I believe a very minor fact check to round out this agenda item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12116.629s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for indulging me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12117.61s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And with that, I would move the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12409.448s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll second it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12414.293s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Really excited to see the sign go up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12415.875s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Can't wait to visit in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12417.136s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just to confirm, you will be keeping like extra late hours on Tuesday nights, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12550.984s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well, I was gonna make a motion that might supersede the poll that you're about to take.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12577.063s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, I'll move to suspend the rules to take 23055 and 24502.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12581.106s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On the motion to suspend to take 23055 and 24502 by Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13483.723s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13485.203s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to first start by thanking the community members that have been advocating this for a very long time, and then Councilors Tseng and Leming for leading on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13495.226s">[Kit Collins]</a>: To me, what this ordinance project says is the city's existing policy of non-cooperation with federal ICE agents is so good and makes so much sense and is so common sense that we should enshrine that as a city ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13511.391s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I just agree with that wholeheartedly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13513.672s">[Kit Collins]</a>: To me, what this says is we want to protect Medford resources for the purpose of taking care of Medford residents, not for carrying out orders or agendas that were promulgated somewhere far away from here, not in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13530.076s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Our resources, our personnel, the expertise and the time of our public safety officials, people doing that work in our community, that should be for us, not for a national agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13544.641s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and not for the agenda of any other state or entity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13547.924s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So for that reason, I think it's really the right time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13549.665s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think any time would be a good time to enshrine that existing policy as an ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13553.708s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this is, I think the moment is now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13556.85s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm really proud of my fellow Councilors for putting this together and making sure that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13562.374s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, this policy that the current administration and city staff and public safety officers have been doing just because it's the right thing to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13569.339s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it was obviously the right policy to have that we can make sure that that is protected for the future, come what may.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13576.905s">[Kit Collins]</a>: With that, I'd motion to approve for our first reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15800.965s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15806.427s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I lost track of the 5013C.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15809.188s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, couldn't hear that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15813.83s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll just finish my sentence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15816.191s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15819.412s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'd be happy to make the motion to approve<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15825.18s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15828.581s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Take a vote for approved for first reading with the amendments presented tonight adopted with the exception of that one amendment that Councilor Leming knows the number of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16290.697s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears genuinely appreciate all the discussion around this item I'm glad that we're putting in the work to get this done this month I think this really is urgent I'm really proud of us for doing the hard work to move this from policy to an ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16306.572s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, I'd like to move the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16308.853s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also did just want to note just just again for the record that undocumented immigrants like do have tax ID numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16315.816s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So, um, you know, that's just wanted to correct the record on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16320.798s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16321.098s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I move the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16468.629s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16471.031s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm going to try to keep this brief, but I do think that this project, like any other ordinance, benefits from just a teeny bit of exposition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16479.739s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So let me just orient these proposed amendments in the context of this ordinance and how long it's been on the books.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16487.845s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These proposed amendments are tweaks to the Community Control over Public Surveillance Ordinance, which was passed by the City Council<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16497.013s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in March of 2023, and the amendments are proposed to make sure that the ordinance does a better job of reflecting its original intent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16505.298s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this ordinance was worked on in City Council from 2022 to 2023.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16508.64s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It was collaborated on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16512.962s">[Kit Collins]</a>: by city councilors, residents, city staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16516.263s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The police chief was present with us at many, many subcommittee meetings throughout the process of crafting us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16522.785s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We had sit downs in subcommittee with the mayor, chief of staff, and the chief of police was really grateful to them for putting so much time and conversation into this ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16532.927s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's not in a way, it's really simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16536.508s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In another way, there was a lot to talk about, and I'm really grateful for them for doing that work with us over the course of months, which was predated by literally years of advocacy for such an ordinance by residents in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16548.118s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So what is the Community Control over Public Surveillance Ordinance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16552.082s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is an ordinance that is in no way unique to Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16554.884s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They've been passed in many communities around Massachusetts and elsewhere throughout the country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16560.749s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They provide a way for local communities to have oversight over what surveillance technologies may be used by our municipal governments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16568.455s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They empower city councils and through the venue of the council, the public, to essentially ask the questions, why does the city want to use surveillance technology in our community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16579.223s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What problem is this supposed to solve?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16581.104s">[Kit Collins]</a>: How will it solve it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16582.065s">[Kit Collins]</a>: How will it help?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16583.186s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What are the potential risks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16584.827s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What are the costs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16586.368s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The City Council may then through the ordinance make a determination of whether the benefits outweigh the potential costs and whether to improve the technology or that use of surveillance data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16596.816s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Or not, or you know potentially condition it or put certain stipulations on it, etc.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16601.839s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It creates a forum to have these discussions over this extremely new rapidly proliferating<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16608.865s">[Kit Collins]</a>: form of technology that has known, demonstrated, documented bad implications for civil liberties, for privacy, especially for marginalized populations, but not only for marginalized populations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16628.107s">[Kit Collins]</a>: creates a way for the community to have more of a listening ear and more of a voice in these conversations that often have to do with incredibly expensive things that cities are being lobbied to purchase from private corporations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16643.381s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A lot of these technologies are being very, very aggressively marketed to municipalities like ours by the corporations that develop them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16650.928s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And, you know, as one Councilor my goal with this ordinance is to make sure that in in one year and five year and 25 years, we're still spending public dollars on things that actually truly help Medford's public safety, more than they enrich the bottom lines of technology corporations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16671.044s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that's, that's the briefest overview I can give, but if anybody wants to talk at length about surveillance technology and civil liberties with me hit me up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16681.708s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The amendments that we're putting forward tonight that we workshopped in community that came from suggestions, sorry, that we workshopped in committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16689.31s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that came out of suggestions from the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16692.793s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These are two amendments that just constitute two ways that we can further tighten up this ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16698.717s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also want to note just again for background, it's not at all unusual to return to a fairly recent ordinance or an old one and make amendments to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16707.323s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We did this with our kind of technical zoning tweaks over the past couple years after we put forward some like technical amendments, we put them into use and that putting it into use alerted us to things that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16718.331s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're having unintended consequences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16720.754s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we go back and you know now that we've like put it on the road a little bit we go back and fix it, tighten the screws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16725.88s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I see that as being part of this process, making amendments that help us to better embody the original intent of the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16734.292s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So there are two sections that I'm proposing changes to tonight that we worked on in public health and community safety committee that was circulated to Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16745.056s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The proposed addition to section 5079, which covers enforcement, remedies, penalties, and whistleblower protections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16755.0s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That is to, that's additional language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16761.226s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That says, I read this all out of the committee meeting last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16764.849s">[Kit Collins]</a>: To the extent permitted by law, including but not limited to, the requirements of the Massachusetts Public Records Law or the Municipal Records Retention Schedule, any video footage or other data recorded or obtained illegally or in violation of this ordinance shall be immediately destroyed and not introduced as evidence in any criminal or civil proceeding, except in those proceedings related to violations of this ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16784.708s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What's the point of that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16808.326s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think, yeah, I think that is comprised within it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16817.658s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I can go faster, but I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16821.243s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So you can just say that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16825.543s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Section 59, there is an oversight in the original ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16829.305s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It states how surveillance data can and cannot be used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16831.487s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It doesn't say what happens if we find ourselves having surveillance data that we oughtn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16837.531s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This says it's got to be deleted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16840.213s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Similar to how if evidence is obtained without a warrant, it can't be used in a trial, the similar principle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16846.518s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In Section 5080, this covers<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16850.999s">[Kit Collins]</a>: uh, contracts that might result in surveillance data being generated elsewhere, being used by a municipality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16857.525s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, this is to remove an exception, um, that bulk commercially generated surveillance data may be used if it's in service of law enforcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16869.114s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, it's, it's still being wrestled with by state and federal courts, um, if it's constitutional for this to happen at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16876.04s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But by removing this exception, we're just making this section consistent with the intent of the rest of the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16883.202s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No carve-outs, just one process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16885.282s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If we're going to use surveillance tech or surveillance data, it's going to be subject to a public process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16890.084s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I do have one really small tweak to make to the section in 5080 that is really just a semantic change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16896.285s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I can, well, I'll just say it now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16901.403s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The change to 5080 would be to strike the word bulk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16905.724s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That appears bulk surveillance data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16908.325s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We don't need the word bulk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16909.125s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're going to strike that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16910.665s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I would also add the phrase or any information derived from such data after the words surveillance data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16923.729s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In the first sentence and then in the last sentence, which is an addition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16941.955s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Same change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16943.377s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's just to clarify that we're talking about both surveillance data or any information that might be derived from such data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16954.587s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I will email that to the clerk right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16960.3s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would motion to, after consideration by my fellow councillors, I would motion to approve for first reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17148.517s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A couple points to clarify.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17150.678s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One, I didn't state that the chief wasn't involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17154.941s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I reached out to him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17155.681s">[Kit Collins]</a>: He didn't respond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17158.262s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know he's a busy guy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17160.544s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We involved him every step of the way when the 99.9% of the ordinance that isn't changing was crafted between 2022 and 2023.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17169.328s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And another thing that I do remember specifically from those months of meetings in the previous term was that the chief repeatedly emphasized that the city of Medford currently does not have a practice of purchasing surveillance data targeted or in bulk, and also has no plans to do so in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17186.338s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this would have, unless that is no longer correct or wasn't correct at the time, this would have no impact on the work of public safety in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17811.256s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, paper 24513 offered by President Bears's resolution to request changes to propose Tufts Dormitory Project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17818.862s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Whereas Tufts University has proposed a new dormitory project at 401 Boston Ave, and whereas the City Council strongly supports legislative efforts to pass fairer state laws<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17828.149s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to encourage collaboration and partnership between large nonprofit institutions like Tufts and municipalities like Medford, and whereas the City Council also strongly supports the goal and intent of providing significant additional on-campus housing by Tufts, and whereas the City Council thanks area residents for voicing their concerns and attempting to have more robust and collaborative public input on the Tufts dormitory proposal, and whereas the City Council does not have a decision-making role regarding this project,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17856.881s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Now therefore be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we request that Tufts University use an alternative site plan or add another site to the project to reduce height and impact of shadows on the surrounding neighborhood while also increasing the tree canopy and adding additional streetscape improvements to their project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17874.537s">[Kit Collins]</a>: be it further resolved that we request that Tufts University drop opposition to and or state their support for state legislation to implement the Institutional Master Plan Home Rule petitions proposed for nearly a decade by the cities of Medford and Somerville and state legislation to create a mandatory pilot payment in lieu of taxes law for large educational and medical nonprofit institutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17896.074s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Be it further resolved that we thank the Community Development Board and our city staff team for their work as this proposal moves through the public process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=17905.25s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18374.094s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=18374.955s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll go next to Councilor Tseng and then Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=19897.227s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I see, Elizabeth, your hand up again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=19900.529s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is this a hand from before, or do you want to speak for an additional minute?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=19914.439s">[Kit Collins]</a>: OK, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=19914.959s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll give you one additional minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=19916.901s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=19921.212s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sorry, did you say that you did mean to put your hand down or you'd like to speak again on this topic?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=19929.401s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=19930.061s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's really late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=19939.657s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My mistake.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20137.709s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm going to give you just another moment to finish your thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20139.851s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Apologies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20156.363s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for your comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20161.496s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing no additional public comment on zoom or in the chambers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20164.962s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is there any additional comment by city councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20170.512s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would just say for myself as one Councilor, I am a staunch proponent of Tufts working to take more responsibility for housing the students that it enrolls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20181.46s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I very much resent this process, which has led so many neighbors and abutters feeling so left out and unconsidered in this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20194.19s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we're all aware that Tufts is a very large, very wealthy institution, and there are many ways to solve this problem of needing to house more students on campus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20204.138s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On the motion of President Bears, seconded by Councilor Callahan, Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20239.1s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20240.001s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seven in favor, none opposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20241.182s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The resolution passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20242.263s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much to all the constituents who wait on us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20501.411s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20502.632s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to restate the timeline that you just laid out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20506.274s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Very grateful to city staff, residents, and our zoning consultant that joined us for our two recent meetings on the draft zoning proposal for the Salem Street Corridor District in the Planning and Permitting Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20520.003s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And this is really just a midway point in the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20525.607s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll go to the Community Development Board for public hearings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20527.829s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They will promulgate recommendations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20529.09s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We will hear those before the City Council again before we take a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20532.173s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I have a motion to refer this to the Community Development Board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20534.695s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, motion to refer this to the Community Development Board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20704.358s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, sorry, my mic was on before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20707.52s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But just want to note, I support the intent of the B paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20710.281s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm not sure if logistically it'll be possible to have a CDB meeting or a city council regular meeting at the Roberts School, but I think it's in the spirit of making sure that we're continuing to improve our efforts of involving local abutters and neighbors in the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20724.068s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So if that results in a meeting at the Roberts, we're just continuing to try to do a better and better job each time and inviting the neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=20729.85s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm more than happy to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cCFTFy23gjY&t=761.948s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Present<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cCFTFy23gjY&t=937.252s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are there any nominations for the role of president of the city council for the year 2025?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cCFTFy23gjY&t=941.953s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Seheult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cCFTFy23gjY&t=954.434s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Do I have a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cCFTFy23gjY&t=956.235s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seconded by Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cCFTFy23gjY&t=962.36s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On the nomination of Councilor Zach Bares for the role of President of the City Council for the 2025 term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cCFTFy23gjY&t=969.866s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cCFTFy23gjY&t=974.51s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, are there any additional nominations?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cCFTFy23gjY&t=987.444s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Hearing none, Mr. Clerk, whenever you're ready, you can call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cCFTFy23gjY&t=994.171s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, this is why you're the president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cCFTFy23gjY&t=995.853s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Do you accept the nomination?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cCFTFy23gjY&t=999.277s">[Kit Collins]</a>: He says begrudgingly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cCFTFy23gjY&t=1029.617s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cCFTFy23gjY&t=1031.097s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Six in favor, one present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cCFTFy23gjY&t=1034.038s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Bears will be the president of the council for the year 2025.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=408.459s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=410.06s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=411.08s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Am I on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=411.821s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=412.181s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=423.206s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=424.026s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for bearing with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=425.067s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There will be a meeting of the Medford City Council Planning and Permitting Committee, December 11th, 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=433.39s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=448.916s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=449.196s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Present five present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=451.618s">[Kit Collins]</a>: None absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=452.459s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The meeting is called to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=454.061s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The action discussion item for this meeting is once again 24-033 zoning ordinance updates with the Innes Associates team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=463.99s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=465.051s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, City staff for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=466.812s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you to members of the public for joining us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=470.795s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is, I believe, the 16th, the agenda says, the 16th Zoning Updates Project Meeting with Innes Associates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=477.658s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This week we are again talking about the Salem Street Corridor Zoning Proposal discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=483.62s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We touched on this topic last week, last Tuesday as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=486.881s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Really glad to be talking about this with you all again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=489.482s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm just going to briefly reintroduce this specific topic and then I'll hand it over to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=498.026s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and we'll have a presentation by Innes Associates and commentary by city staff, and then we'll proceed with our discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=506.533s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But just to quickly reintroduce what we're talking about today, this is our second time having a full meeting devoted to the Salem Street Corridor District.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=517.243s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is just one part of the City Council's systemic review and update of citywide zoning over the course of this term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=523.628s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've been working with Innes Associates, thank you for being here, which also assisted the city on the years-long comprehensive plan process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=533.337s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this corridor proposal, like other aspects of the zoning project, have been crafted by Ennis in consultation with, oh, thank you for letting me know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=551.454s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So these zoning proposals crafted by the zoning consultant in consultation with this committee and city staff, all of these are guided by citywide goals and community feedback as articulated in the comprehensive plan, the housing production plan, the climate action and adaptation plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=566.936s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and the community input and feedback that we're very fortunate to have throughout this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=572.558s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just because I take every opportunity to say this, after these proposals leave this committee, they go back to the city council, they then are procedurally must be referred to the community development board for their review and recommendations, and then come back to the city council once again, before those votes to ordain are taken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=591.584s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's a complicated process, so I like to repeat it as often as possible, because I know it took me a while to internalize it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=597.581s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So like I said, the initial draft of the Salem Street corridor zoning proposal was presented to this committee on December 3rd for some initial feedback, questions and comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=607.585s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The project proposes new zoning for the corridor along Salem Street, which includes the roughly two to four parcels extending north and south of Salem Street, beginning at the Route 60 roundabout and extending up to Haines Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=619.21s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this proposal does not include the greater Salem Street neighborhood outside of those boundaries, though of course it does touch them and is adjacent to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=628.971s">[Kit Collins]</a>: for getting further into the weeds than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=632.053s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I will pass it off to Innes Associates for a presentation, which I understand we saw a really similar presentation to this last week, but I think you're going to highlight some of the tweaks and changes that have been incorporated since last week based on feedback that we got from the community as well as feedback from councilors and city staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=650.426s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Before I turn it over, any initial comments or questions from councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=656.63s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=766.02s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=2924.99s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for the presentation, Paola and Emily really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=2930.575s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll echo what you said this is a lot to take in zoning always is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=2933.978s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's one of our challenges here is this is a zoning is never not going to be technical complicated veering into wonky and confusing so I appreciate you doing your very best to break it down for Councilors members of the public, whether we're seeing it for the third time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=2952.621s">[Kit Collins]</a>: like councillors are for the first time as some members of the public, maybe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=2955.743s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=2957.905s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Lots to delve into here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=2958.826s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll go first to any comments or questions from my fellow councillors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=2966.233s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=2990.451s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Want to speak to the citywide parking strategy we're thinking about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3133.727s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Did you have a follow-up to that, Councilor Lohmann?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3144.53s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3144.81s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Or President Bears, I'll go to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3183.341s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3187.344s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3188.464s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3374.631s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3375.792s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3376.772s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And before I turn it over to Ines to respond, it looks like there is a response percolating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3383.036s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just before this meeting,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3386.772s">[Kit Collins]</a>: began, we were talking about more ways that we can continue to expand the use of diagrams.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3391.435s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know this isn't exactly what you're proposing, but kind of that ongoing theme of what else can we include apart from just the text to convey what we're talking about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3400.22s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Because even as one councillor who talks about this as much as anybody else behind the rail, it still takes a lot of effort to understand what we're talking about and break it down and paraphrase it in ways that people can understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3411.566s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I certainly sympathize with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3413.607s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for bringing it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3433.55s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3434.11s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that that's something that I want us to continue to explore, and that if that's something that council leadership can help support NS Associates on, because I know you're doing the lion's share of the work in putting together the complicated proposal, which is legally required, maybe that's something that we can work on to have a more layman-friendly version to accompany these documents when they do come before the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3453.742s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's something we'll certainly continue to talk about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3456.524s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know Councilor Leming had a comment, unless there's a direct response from NS or city staff on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3464.062s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No pressure, I just... Councilor Lohmann, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3519.862s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3520.762s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And yeah, I think that's a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3523.919s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Breaking it down, making it simpler is something that we'll continue to try to improve out over the course of this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3529.129s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If you had something to add there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3602.432s">[Kit Collins]</a>: great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3603.092s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3603.692s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that that could be a thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3608.213s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3608.573s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilors Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3610.234s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are there any other questions or comments from Councilors on the Salem Street corridor proposal at this time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3619.155s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3619.495s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was really happy to see, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3621.836s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Some of the themes that were brought up last week and another conversations<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3630.851s">[Kit Collins]</a>: what's the term, the context standards for when we do have those transitions from a mixed use or commercial building to a residential right next to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3638.917s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's a really smart way of making sure that we don't see those really sharp height differences, even if it's only, in a lot of cases, gonna be the difference of a story or two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3651.366s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that makes a lot of sense to airspace protection from shade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3658.271s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know that there are, I was happy to see also some of the additions to the incentive zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3664.836s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think the theme here is we want to make sure that we are strongly incentivizing developers to add these things to our communities that we know we want there, while at the same time making sure that we're getting a lot out of it when they are taking advantage of those opportunities for extra heights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3680.748s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know that there are more potential things that we're looking to add into incentive zoning that aren't a part of this draft that we're going to continue to consider and maybe add into incentive zoning, either for specific districts or citywide, but that need more discussion and meetings to think about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3695.231s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thanks for your diligence on that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3698.932s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing no further comments or questions from councilors, we can, any comments or questions from city staff at this time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3707.274s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3712.85s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go ahead, Director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3769.378s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3770.478s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for flagging that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3772.359s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we'll go to President Bears and then we'll go to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3786.745s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Do you have a follow-up question on that point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3802.05s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go back to President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3803.031s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3861.688s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And if it is, it's a type of... My apologies, President Bears, I thought that was direct response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3866.71s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, in my understanding, it's only in the C sub-districts of which there's just that tiny parcel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3871.391s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's the current gas station remaining.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3879.415s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3933.232s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3934.092s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for reiterating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3934.973s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3936.494s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3936.694s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll go down to public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3937.935s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm going to alternate between the podium and participants on zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3941.137s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm going to set a timer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3942.017s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Every person who'd like to speak, we'll have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3945.82s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then at the end Councilors or at the end of all public participation, Councilors and associates, city staff may speak again if they wish.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3956.406s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3957.727s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4142.915s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4143.295s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for your comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4144.175s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll switch next to Zoom and then back to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4147.676s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4148.176s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm going to unmute you, Martha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4150.317s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4152.277s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4281.167s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for your comments, Martha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4282.168s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, we'll go back<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4286.328s">[Kit Collins]</a>: To the podium now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4287.716s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4289.901s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4422.605s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for your comments, and as one quick note, we will be visiting West Medford in our citywide review of the zoning ordinance that'll be coming in the spring of 2025.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4433.489s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're looking at West Medford so residents can look forward to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4437.931s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We will switch back to Zoom now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4439.431s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Jayme, I'm going to ask you to unmute, name and address for the record, please, and you have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4474.761s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4477.382s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah Jamie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4478.522s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4478.983s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If you have other questions, feel free to will bucket these and we'll address them all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4515.293s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4515.513s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4515.793s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have a question about am I and then the calculation used for lot extension onto the side streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4520.815s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any other questions that you wanted to pose to, uh, last question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4554.949s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4555.87s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Jamie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4556.65s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we have questions around approximate dollar value for AMI, for the incentive zoning, which is, you know, a citywide thought process or calculation behind the lot extension onto the side streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4571.924s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then to, again, revisit the thinking behind the Parks and Salem Street intersection designation at MX2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4581.232s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for those questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4582.473s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm going to let, I see one more person for public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4585.095s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think we're going to round that out and then we'll respond to all questions in a batch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4591.401s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4596.185s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4596.725s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4597.846s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And you have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4824.26s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have 20 seconds left.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4824.98s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4852.022s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for your comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4853.923s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4855.683s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just want to note that this proposal doesn't change any existing parking ratios, ratios per unit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4863.186s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's true of all the zoning proposals that this council has reviewed so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4867.188s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also want to note that a lot of the ground floor commercial businesses along Salem Street are nonconformant with the current zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4873.43s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This proposal would allow them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4876.857s">[Kit Collins]</a>: just a point of clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4878.719s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll go next to Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4881.522s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I saw Ellery's hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4883.204s">[Kit Collins]</a>: First, I'll ask to unmute you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4884.325s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I need your name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=4887.309s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And you have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5101.628s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5102.329s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Ellery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5104.27s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll go back to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5106.011s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5107.472s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5256.543s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5257.444s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll go back to Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5258.544s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're going to hear from folks who haven't spoken before, and then we can take an additional minute of comment from folks who have already spoken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5267.909s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Dave, please go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5269.731s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5271.612s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5456.431s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you, Dave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5461.913s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, you're at time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5462.594s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll give you 30 more seconds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5492.159s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you very much, Dave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5493.701s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, we'll go next to Ren on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5496.765s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Please name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5498.788s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5507.589s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You're off mute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5508.249s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5709.076s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for your comments, Ran.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5712.734s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, I don't see any more hands raised on Zoom or in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5716.196s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do want to make sure we double back to a couple specific questions that were raised earlier in public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5722.76s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have some numbers up relating to some quick numbers for area median income, but I suspect there's somebody on that side of the rail who can state it more quickly and eloquently than me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5734.867s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Alicia, Danielle, Emily, Paula, would you like to speak to that question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5737.988s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Or I can read off my spreadsheet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5747.484s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And this was just to put some kind of, you know, comprehensible dollar figures to that concept of we talked about 80% AMI, 65% AMI.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5753.014s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If you like, yeah, I don't think we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5919.847s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5920.765s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5922.066s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's helpful to put, you know, kind of understandable numbers that people can think in terms of rent checks or mortgage payments when we talk about these percentages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5929.83s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5930.191s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then the other two specific questions were around, I know you mentioned in the presentation on that question of where should be MX1, where should be MX2 and the intersection of Salem and Park Street specifically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5942.898s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I recall you saying, you know, paraphrasing, where will we have those more active intersections where there's,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5949.122s">[Kit Collins]</a>: more ground floor businesses where it's a busier intersection where there's already more, those are in the proposal characterized as MX2 to reflect that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5957.854s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Can you talk a little bit about Park and Salem specifically?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=5965.303s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, gosh, this mic system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6218.356s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, really appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6221.419s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think the way it was phrased in the suggestion, the way you phrased it just now, that we're doing this in a geography by geography basis, knowing that all of these geographies are really close together and the changes we make in one neighborhood will affect, they all affect the context.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6237.053s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think it can make a lot of sense when we do visit Medford Square in a couple of months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6242.918s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When we're looking at that proposal when we've come to, you know, close to consensus on that proposal to then look to the, you know, areas of the abutting geographies and say, now that we've made these decisions, what, how does that imply, how does that implicate the decisions that we've made in this neighboring area and, you know, kind of be continuing to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6259.028s">[Kit Collins]</a>: think about these questions of where we know we need density, where does it make the most sense where should we do that, where should we prioritize for densification or any of the other goals that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6267.261s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also want to note because you talked about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6270.225s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If folks are interested in the those kind of like aerial maps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6274.952s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that Emily mentioned that kind of informed some of these decisions about like what to prioritize where on the city zoning page and MedfordMA.org slash zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6283.698s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Scroll down this time beyond phase two meeting documents under resources, click down from citywide maps, click on land use maps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6292.204s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's a world of details you can get lost in, but I know for folks who are really interested in this stuff, that's your window into the maps that the council and the consultant and city staff looked at several times earlier in this process to inform some of what we're putting where.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6305.533s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6538.006s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6538.446s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'll just flag the last, the final question that was specifically asked, which goes back to the previous question was, um, the areas where the zoning proposal, it sometimes extends to parcels north and south.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6549.629s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It sometimes extends for, I think that dovetails is what you were saying about looking at the geographies, looking at the overlapping characteristics, but just in case there was anything you wanted to add on that, um, those decisions and specifically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6637.315s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6638.075s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate the very granular approach that you took to deciding where the corridor starts and ends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6767.842s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6770.844s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6771.385s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6773.707s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Quick follow-up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6774.247s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know President Bears has been waiting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6997.214s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=6997.855s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Pierce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7002.299s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Paula, something to add?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7013.911s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sorry, can you speak up a little bit with the fan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7015.491s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's very hard to hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7131.408s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7132.396s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7206.164s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7206.865s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for that, Director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7208.185s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7212.435s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and good to know what the window of opportunity is for continuing to tweak individual parcels on the map before it gets, you know, to be a real case to be open to do that again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7220.461s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On that, so should this be reported out of committee tonight, then as we've said a lot of times before, we'll go to the city council and then be referred to the CDB for the recommendations and review and then back to the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7234.211s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Since we are speaking about, you know, this window of opportunity still being open for revisiting individual parcels,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7243.891s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I wonder if it's something that the CDB might be able to specifically weigh in on, this one parcel that kind of sticks out more than all the others in this corridor, the target lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7252.699s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As a result of Councilor and community feedback last meeting, that was changed from commercial to mixed use to to allow for ground floor commercial to allow for residential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7264.315s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is kind of like the most unique lot on the corridor I think and I'm just wondering if we can while that window is open if we can continue if there's any other sub districts that we could carry in from the MACD so that we can capture all of those goals on this one very unique lot the ground floor commercial the residential and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7282.253s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have the benefit here of a lot of space, which isn't present elsewhere on the corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7286.115s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I wonder if we can consider more height there beyond just what's allowed for all of the other mixed use two parcels on this corridor, which the dimensions there are totally different than what we're looking for here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7296.98s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If that's something that the CDB and the consultants could weigh in on before the council sees this next, I think I'd be interested to see if there's any other creative<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7311.249s">[Kit Collins]</a>: sub-districts we could look at there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7315.197s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One day we'll get multiple microphones for this situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7319.505s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7369.423s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7370.283s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7372.904s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, well, this two hours is simply flown by.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7377.426s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are there any remaining questions or comments from councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7385.251s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing none, the next step in this process would be for this to be referred out of committee to a regular meeting of the city council, where then procedurally it would be referred to the CDB for their review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7398.478s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Do I hear a motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7401.314s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On the motion by Councilor Leming to report out of committee, seconded by Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7409.302s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Roll call votes, no longer necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7410.884s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7414.087s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7415.708s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7419.332s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to adjourn by Councilor Callahan, seconded by Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7422.735s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7424.212s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All opposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7425.653s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7427.013s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for being with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7428.574s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, city staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7429.374s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Ennis, for this proposal and for continuing to workshop it with us and to continue to take in our feedback and the feedback for the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=7437.777s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=507.25s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=508.27s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Chair Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=509.531s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm the sponsor of these technical amendments to the CCOPS ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=514.973s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I thought I would just start with a little bit of a background.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=517.454s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Can folks hear me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=518.815s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=520.836s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just thought I would start with a little bit of a background on the CCOPS ordinance because this was passed in the previous term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=526.658s">[Kit Collins]</a>: when some members of the Council were not yet part of the Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=530.342s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just as a super quick background, this is an ordinance that the City Council worked on between 2022 and 2023.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=540.591s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it was being workshopped by constituents for a long time before that, but that's when it was on the Council's plate and being worked on in committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=549.158s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We collaborated with residents, the public health and community safety committee at that time, city staff, the chief of police to create it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=555.363s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it passed about a year and a half ago, maybe a little bit more now in 2023.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=560.627s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this ordinance stands for community control over public surveillance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=565.05s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In a nutshell, this is a way that provides for local communities to have oversight over what surveillance technologies and data may be used by different branches of their municipal government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=578.28s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's a structure that is not unique to Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=580.923s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's been passed in a lot of other communities and including other communities in Massachusetts that empower communities through the city council to ask to have an opportunity to ask the questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=594.597s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Why do we want to use the surveillance technology in our city?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=597.998s">[Kit Collins]</a>: To what ends?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=599.219s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What are the proposed benefits?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=600.92s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What problem is this supposed to solve?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=603.0s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Will it cost us how much?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=604.501s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What are the possible negative effects?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=606.522s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And to be able to ask those questions and have those conversations and weigh those pros and cons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=610.383s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in public transparently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=613.246s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think this was a really big win for the community when we passed this last year, because that was the city being proactive and responding to residents who said, hey, we have a privacy and civil liberties concern around these surveillance technologies proliferating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=626.156s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Wow, proliferating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=628.938s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Damn, I gotta stop talking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=632.441s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Responding to this very real perceived danger, because we know the effects that surveillance technologies have, we know the dangers that they pose, we know the dangers that they really have posed in other communities around the U.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=646.425s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and around the world, and to proactively say, before these take root in our community, let's set up a public, transparent process for us to have that conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=655.807s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=656.508s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that's the CCOPS ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=658.529s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's been on the books for about a year and a half.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=660.731s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And at this point, some community advocates have come forward with ideas for how to strengthen the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=666.195s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I also just want to say that it's not unusual for us to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=669.338s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's not unusual for us to go back to an ordinance that either maybe was passed a long time ago or that was a recently<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=675.542s">[Kit Collins]</a>: added or updated and say now that this has been in play for a little bit, that implementation has shown us some cracks that we can go back and fill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=683.631s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We did this recently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=684.632s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The zoning recodification that was done before I was a part of the council two terms ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=692.019s">[Kit Collins]</a>: when those zoning tweaks were put into effect, that gave the planning staff the opportunity to say, now that we've put this into practice, now that we're working with this, we've actually noticed a couple of things that we missed, that were misstated, that we should just go back and fix so that this works the way that we mean it to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=706.569s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this is just part of our legislative process as I see it to say, now that we've got the wheels on this thing, we can see it in motion, we can see what we wanna tweak so that it actually operates the way that we always intended it to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=718.058s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So if I may go on, that brings us to the two suggestions from the community on how to tighten this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=727.105s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I am happy to just go through and walk us through those two technical amendments unless other councilors want to cut in first with questions or comments or anything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=756.429s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let me just get my windows in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=778.148s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=779.389s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, that seems to be working.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=781.51s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also wanna note if folks are looking for the full ordinance, the ordinance that was passed in 2023, that is on Muny Code.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=788.575s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's in the municipal documents section, not in the code of ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=792.778s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's because we just have a bit of a backlog with getting past ordinances uploaded into Muny Code.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=798.062s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So it's up there, it's under municipal documents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=810.884s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=812.406s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=813.447s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=813.808s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm just going to quickly walk us through the two proposed changes to the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=819.69s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So the first one, this would be in addition to section 5079, and that's the section that goes over enforcement, remedies, penalties, and whistleblower protections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=831.586s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Actually, let me just quickly scroll up to that section so that we can kind of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=835.191s">[Kit Collins]</a>: ground ourselves in context, not going to read the whole thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=838.214s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But this is the set, this is the ordinance that's currently on the books.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=842.039s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this essentially says who enforces this ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=845.723s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The mayor's office or the mayor's designee edges the case with all of ordinances, essentially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=851.67s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If violations occur.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=853.504s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What then, if violations are reported, what then protections for whistleblowers so that people are empowered to speak up if they think the ordinance is being violated?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=862.713s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And nothing in this ordinance shall be conscrued to limit or affect any individual's rights under state or federal laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=869.78s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's the section currently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=872.472s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The proposed addition reads any video footage or other data recorded or obtained illegally or in violation of this ordinance shall be immediately destroyed and not introduced as evidence in any criminal or civil proceeding, except in those proceedings related to violations of this ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=890.925s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just to explain that, this proposed tweak is to essentially fix an oversight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=897.389s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The original ordinance in its many sections states how surveillance data may and may not be used, but the penalties are for not adhering to use of surveillance technology or data throughout the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=908.995s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But what it is silent on is what should happen to surveillance data that is obtained outside the bounds of the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=918.2s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this tweak is to say, you know, any surveillance data that is gathered in a way that does not conform to the regulations put forth in the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=925.685s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If we didn't, for example, if we didn't approve a surveillance technology, that technology went into use anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=931.508s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It was used to protect, it was used to collect people's private data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=935.13s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then we realized that we're like, oh, sorry, that should never have been in use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=938.973s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We never got permission to use that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=940.894s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What happens to that data?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=942.235s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well, it shouldn't be kept around because that could compromise people's privacy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=945.937s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It should be deleted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=946.717s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It should be destroyed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=948.579s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is kind of, to me, I'm not a lawyer, but this sounds to me like a similar concept to how if an agency were ever to obtain evidence without a warrant, that evidence can't be used because it was obtained illegally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=963.285s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We did pass these proposed amendments to legal prior to this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=968.426s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Legal counsel brought up that some municipal data must be maintained according to public records law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=975.088s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I believe the public records law would supersede this ordinance in any case, but I do have a little bit of extra language to propose just to make that point really clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=985.611s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll pause there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1061.292s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1063.333s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for, yeah, thank you for that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1065.614s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is something that I'm glad you brought that up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1067.335s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is something that we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1069.648s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that like understandably was raised when we were going over the ordinance the first time around, because of the you know there's there's ring and nest cameras you know everywhere everywhere everywhere you look people have that kind of technology now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1083.058s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we can certainly look at making that clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1085.14s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think elsewhere in the ordinance, we took pains to make it clear that we're talking just about surveillance technology that's used by the city, surveillance data collected by the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1094.05s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And explicitly, this is not about surveillance technology that people might be using.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1100.297s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to surveil their own private property on their own private property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1103.639s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think that's been made pretty clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1104.899s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't wanna, my only hesitation is if we start adding clarifications in specific sections, I don't want people to then say, oh, so this doesn't affect my nest camera, but what about this other part?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1117.786s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That would be my only concern with adding language somewhere in addition to what's kind of at the top of the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1182.611s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I think that's a good question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1185.193s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I feel pretty comfortable that the ordinance throughout is, in the language, very targeted at municipal use of surveillance technology and surveillance data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1201.322s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm doing a, as you can see, because I'm still screen sharing, I'm kind of scrolling through the sections, and I feel pretty comfortable with how the language, you know, it's talking about municipal use,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1214.188s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, so for myself, I don't feel the need to add a disclaimers at this time, but I think it's, um, I'll pass it back to Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1249.457s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1249.857s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This proposed addition, yeah, all the stuff that we're going to talk about tonight has been reviewed, was reviewed by legal this past week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1256.941s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1257.722s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And they had a couple of small amendments that I'll mention as well and can put on the screen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1265.006s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1267.062s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just while we're on this, while we're on this section, this proposed addition, the comment from legal counsel on this section specifically, which just came in earlier today,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1284.83s">[Kit Collins]</a>: was, again, just to many of the comments that we received when we were working on the initial ordinance was to say, we want to make really sure that this comports with state and federal law, to which, to be totally candid, my response is usually, of course it does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1297.116s">[Kit Collins]</a>: State and federal law supersedes city ordinances by definition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1302.798s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I also don't think that it changes the intent or impact of the city ordinance to add some of the language or version of the language that was proposed, which would be to add<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1314.204s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to the extent permitted by law, including but not limited to the requirements of the Massachusetts public records law, the municipal records retention schedule, et cetera, any video footage or other data recorded or obtained illegally or in violation of this ordinance shall be immediately destroyed and not introduced as evidence in any criminal or civil proceeding except in those proceedings related to violations of this ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1342.005s">[Kit Collins]</a>: because that's essentially stating what should go without saying, but doesn't because we don't all have GDs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1350.149s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that would be one addition that I would propose for this, in addition to the addition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1383.638s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let me see if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1385.298s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Or maybe an email.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1386.219s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll repeat it, and I'll also email it to the clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1388.68s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1391.901s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Of course, I can't copy over from a Word document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1397.523s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I will email it to the clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1400.385s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The change would be proceeding the language that's on the screen, it would say to the extent permitted by law, including but not limited to the requirements of the Massachusetts public records law and the municipal records retention schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1418.622s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then proceed with that paragraph.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1463.211s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this change again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1466.172s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let me scroll up here just so we can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1469.383s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Look at the original.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1471.565s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Section 5080, well, I mean, it's what we're looking at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1474.308s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is the entirety of Section 5080 currently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1479.534s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Current title is certain public-private contracts prohibited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1483.758s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just one paragraph.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1484.759s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So my proposed change would be to keep the first section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1488.709s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It shall be unlawful for the city to enter into any contract for monetary value or engage in any financial transaction with a commercial entity that provides the city with the mass acquisition of privately generated and owned bulk surveillance data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1500.462s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any contracts or agreements signed prior to the enactment of this ordinance that violate the section shall not be renewed after the completion of the term of said contracts or agreements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1509.352s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then we would strike the following existing line from the ordinance, which reads section 5080 shall not apply to any contract or agreement executed for law enforcement operations or purposes, then we would add the language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1523.129s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Further, it shall be unlawful for the city to acquire or enter into an agreement to acquire or exchange bulk surveillance data that the city is banned from generating on its own with any other government entity or policing agency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1535.861s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It would be also to replace the word contracts in the section title with the word transactions, which is broader.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1545.229s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, so the proposed change here is to remove that exception.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1549.173s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, throughout the rest of the ordinance, we say if you're going to use surveillance tech, if you're going to use or procure or sell or do anything with surveillance data, it has to go through this public transparent process where we talk about it before the city council decides this is worth it or this is not worth the potential harms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1567.111s">[Kit Collins]</a>: With this one exception for a carve out for procuring bulk surveillance data where it's commercially available for the purposes of law enforcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1577.857s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this tweak is just to remove that one exception and make it coherent with the rest of the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1583.58s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is something that I didn't say at the top of this meeting, but it's something that we talked about a lot when we were going through the initial stages of the ordinance, that this policy does not, this policy is about surveillance tech and surveillance data, but it doesn't outright ban or enable any one use or technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1601.971s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It doesn't single anything out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1603.972s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It just puts forward this public process that should govern all of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1607.054s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So removing this exemption would just bring that in line with the rest of the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1612.017s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also think that kind of bringing this section into the fold and into consistency with the rest of the ordinance is especially topical right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1623.844s">[Kit Collins]</a>: State and federal courts have not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1626.986s">[Kit Collins]</a>: yet landed on the constitutionality for any government agency to purchase surveillance data that was gathered commercially or privately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1635.391s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So in lieu of a ruling on this, in lieu of a precedent on this, communities like Medford have the chance to be proactive and make sure that upper levels of government, any government agency can access their constituents' private personal data without a warrant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1653.702s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, and I think that this is especially topical right now, because there are a lot of changes at the federal level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1659.446s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's always a good time to make sure in this, like increasingly increasingly surveilled and digital world that we're doing the best that we can to keep pace with regulations and protections with the incredibly fast pace of technology development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1673.996s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And this is a way for us to be proactive and say we're not going to wait.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1677.878s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For these slow moving like upper bureaucracies and upper jurisdictions to weigh in on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1683.863s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If our community members' public and private data should be able to be bought and sold and used, we're just going to say, you need a warrant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1691.25s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No exceptions, no carve-outs, you need a warrant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1695.094s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So in a nutshell, there's more to, you know, obviously all this stuff is very nuanced, but in a nutshell, that is the intent behind removing this exemption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1844.615s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1847.674s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Chair Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1848.634s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also just wanted to note another, there were a couple minor points that came back from legal on this proposed change as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1857.779s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One of them was, again, I think what I characterize as kind of like a, you know, it's dot RIs cross RTs kind of suggestion that noted that the limitations set forward in this section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1869.925s">[Kit Collins]</a>: should not apply to surveillance data that's already exempted from the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1875.93s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I see the intent behind that language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1878.612s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do kind of think that goes without saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1880.194s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I, you know, kind of personal preference, I sometimes think that stating things too many times in too many sections can actually reduce clarity instead of making things more clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1890.183s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm comfortable with where we have the exemption stated so far in the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1894.487s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think that that language is necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1898.09s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just to make that more clear, there was a suggestion to say this section does not need to apply to surveillance data that was exempted from the provisions of this ordinance as set forth in section 5071.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1910.161s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Section 5071 says this ordinance does not apply to these technologies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1915.646s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think, I feel like if I were to read this ordinance, I would assume that that was true in all sections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1920.009s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I always appreciate a legal counsel's thoroughness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1923.952s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm not myself proposing that as an amendment just because I do think it's unnecessary, but I just wanted to state that for transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1930.757s">[Kit Collins]</a>: However, they did note that the term bulk surveillance data is not defined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1934.96s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that could be worthwhile.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1937.682s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So after we hear from all questions and Councilors, I'm sorry, from all questions and comments, I'll make a couple of motions and included in that, I would ask KP Law to provide a suggestion for a definition of bulk surveillance data that we could add to the first section of the ordinance just to keep everything super clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=2681.101s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=2682.562s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would motion to incorporate the discussed amendments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=2689.144s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I just emailed those to the clerk, that would be the addition to section 5079 with the new first sentence that we discussed in committee pertaining to Massachusetts public records law and municipal records and retention schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=2704.671s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and in Section 5080 to change the title to say transactions instead of contracts, and to make those line item changes to Section 5080, as well as to request guidance on a definition for the term bulk surveillance data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=2723.126s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then I don't want to state Councilor Leming's motion for him, but pending that, I would also motion to incorporate those amendments and report this out of committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=2867.785s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=87.24s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Test 1-2, test 1-2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1533.93s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1534.57s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Chair Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1535.611s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for being here today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1536.831s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know you've been very involved in guiding the committee's work over the past year or so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1541.394s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you so much for being a resource to our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1544.416s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just to rephrase, I haven't been on the committee, so I'm, you know, just want to make sure I'm learning<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1550.034s">[Kit Collins]</a>: learning this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1553.336s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So there's the draft that's been crafted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1556.537s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're going to get a proposal from the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1558.378s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The city council will review that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1559.558s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We may negotiate and make certain changes that the mayor can also sign off on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1565.041s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Once we have that joint agreement between the city council and the mayor on a proposal that both parties agree to, then it is sent to the state legislation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1575.025s">[Kit Collins]</a>: sorry to our state delegation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1576.386s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And at that point, this document that then has kind of the buy in of the City Council, the mayor sign off and review by the legislature, then that would go to the voters for the final vote before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1588.872s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1589.713s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just wanted to make sure I had all those parts of the process in the right order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1592.214s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1592.634s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1690.083s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1691.104s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I know that this probably looks different, like the timelines probably look a little bit different in every community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1697.067s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know you've spoken a little bit to timelines already, like what's the latest that we would want to get the charter back from the legislature?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1706.251s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What are those like hard stops that we need to get it on the ballot if we're going that route?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1711.754s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When you've seen this process get done in other communities, are there any sort of like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1718.516s">[Kit Collins]</a>: very obvious common trends that you see like usually once it gets back to the city council it's a three month process it's easy to get it in before budget time or it's not unusual for it to be a bit of a scramble is there anything that you tend to notice from when this done other cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1786.001s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Gotcha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1786.681s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1787.042s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That makes a lot of sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1787.802s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to make sure that it gets to them and have it be kind of frictionless by the time it gets to the state house so that they'll be able to act on it expeditiously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1795.906s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1801.529s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Good to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=1806.511s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=2136.486s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=2136.946s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, it does seem to me that the, as with most things having to do with our partners in the State House, it seems like the steps there are pretty clear, pretty organized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=2148.129s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They're just, you know, that's where the bureaucracy lives, so we have to make sure that we're- You're competing with their entire agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=2166.235s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We just have to be as soon as we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=2168.677s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=2168.917s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We just have to be really clear about working with their timetables, getting on top of it and giving them as much time and notice as we possibly can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=2175.261s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think for our process, that means trying to expedite the process of coming to consensus about what we are sending to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=2182.728s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I appreciate also the clarity around which of those processes to click into if we're shooting for a November 2025 ballot, or if we're going to, again, try to put it on a state election ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=2193.998s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think that these are all really good benchmarks to have as we head into 2025.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=2198.902s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think my takeaway is making sure that we're<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F83fBWNvQ1Q&t=2202.024s">[Kit Collins]</a>: being diligent and efficient with our piece of the process, putting together the proposal that we'll actually be sending to the state house so that we can make sure that all the hard work that community members, mayor's team, city council, community members have put into this process reaches the state house in time for them to review it and do what we want on the timeline that works for Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=226.674s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, we're in trouble then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=229.416s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=229.976s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is it on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=232.177s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=239.32s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=247.083s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=247.504s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I haven't been chair before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=257.286s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=257.846s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, it is on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=258.426s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=261.927s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=262.787s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Can you turn your microphone on as a test?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=280.762s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=281.823s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That I recall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=299.913s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Can folks is this picking up my voice at all?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=303.875s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Not really.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=345.151s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, I think I'm on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=346.372s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=351.235s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Medford City Council Planning and Permitting Committee, December 3rd, 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=392.505s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, the action discussion item for tonight is again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=396.267s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Paper 24-033 zoning ordinance updates with the Innes Associates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=403.211s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=404.892s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=405.713s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Planner Evans and Director Hunt as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=409.615s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm going to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=412.039s">[Kit Collins]</a>: briefly summarize the agenda for tonight and then turn it over to our guests as we just have about an hour for this meeting with a regular meeting starting at 7 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=422.981s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we've had a busy past couple months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=425.722s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have referred the Mystic Avenue Corridor District zoning proposal to the CDB.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=430.303s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Same with Greenscore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=432.503s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we are kind of in the middle of our discussions, kind of beginning<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=437.004s">[Kit Collins]</a>: middle of the beginning, beginning of the middle of our discussions about the zoning proposal for the Salem Street Corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=444.731s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We touched on that a little bit last time when Vice Chair Leming was presiding over the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=449.575s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The purpose of tonight's meeting is to kind of recenter ourselves and where we are in the timeline of the zoning review project overall, where we are in the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=460.836s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and place the Salem Street zoning proposal in the context of that, its next steps after the committee takes its time with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=468.883s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then we're going to have an introduction to the Salem Street Corridor zoning proposal by NS Associates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=475.888s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is just the first time that the council and the committee is going to have a chance to kind of get a really solid comprehensive overview and start to get into the weeds on this zoning proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=487.739s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've already started advertising for our next planning and permitting committee meeting where we'll be going over the Salem Street zoning proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=496.607s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's going to be next week on Wednesday at our regular time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=499.554s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I understand that in collaboration with Director Hunt and the mayor's office, we put out some promotional materials about this meeting today on social media, as well as a robocall just to make sure that we're really getting the word out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=512.298s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So the purpose of tonight is to introduce this proposal to councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=516.06s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know we've had it in our packets since last week so that we can start to make those comments and ask those questions so that we can be kind of having more informed context for residents in the week between now and next week when we talk about it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=528.344s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And again, invite residents to hear about the proposal and ask questions before the committee takes any further action on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=535.928s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So with that, I'll turn it over unless Danielle or Alicia, if you have any comments that you want to make up top, I'd happily turn it over to Paola to begin her presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=558.725s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=564.5s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, one second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1450.814s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1452.075s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Please go ahead, Emily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1916.633s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Emily and Paola for that overview really appreciate that appreciate you know the I was appreciate getting walked through the zoning proposals even reading them ahead of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1927.343s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's not the same as having a professional zoning planner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1934.023s">[Kit Collins]</a>: define what we're looking at for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1936.744s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Appreciate that, and especially since we've gone through the Mystic Avenue corridor district zoning proposal already, I appreciate kind of the heads up about what we'll see in those sub-districts, where the sub-districts have the same name, but what they mean in Salem Street will be a little bit different, or maybe a lot different than what they mean for Mystic Ave, because Mystic Ave and Salem Street are so different, and what we want to do in those two districts is very different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1958.735s">[Kit Collins]</a>: responsive to, you know, what they are and what they represent in the community and what people do there and what the neighbors want there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1965.902s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you so much for for calling that out kind of at the beginning of this conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1971.687s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know we've had some time to look over this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1977.292s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think, you know, for me, what stands out to me from the presentation so far is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1984.628s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, when I was looking at this prior to the presentation, looking at, you know, where do we have mixed one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1990.992s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Where do we have mixed two?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1992.693s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Where do we have commercial and why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=1994.194s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It makes a lot of sense to me to cluster mixed use close to those intersections that are already, you see a lot of foot traffic, you see a lot of all kinds of traffic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2005.301s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's already really thriving businesses there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2007.882s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We want to enhance that thriving business character at those places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2012.505s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I really appreciated seeing that some blocks are left mixed use one, we can keep that concentration on residential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2020.41s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I really appreciated kind of the thoughtfulness with first defining, you know, Salem Street is a really big neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2027.115s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're not talking about Reno re sorry we're not talking about rezoning the neighborhood here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2031.577s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're talking about rezoning this quarter so I appreciate the thought that was given to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2035.86s">[Kit Collins]</a>: How many parcels, you know, north and south of Salem are we really talking about when it comes to those key intersections what should be at those intersections and when does it taper off back into residential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2046.548s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then what I think is really key and I think something that's really bothered a lot of residents for a lot of time is, what do we need to do to make Haines Square, more we want it to be and start using those big parcels in a way that will be more, more of an advantage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2060.298s">[Kit Collins]</a>: for the folks who live around there and shop there and just want to see more for the community in that space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2067.183s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So with that being said, appreciate the thoughtfulness to the existing character, existing heights and trying to update the zoning to enhance the existing residential business character and make it more of what we want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2080.171s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll go now to comments and questions from the City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2083.813s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2085.014s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll do public presentation at the end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2086.375s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2088.215s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Comments from fellow city councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2093.7s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2261.425s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll move up here so I can actually see my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2263.787s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll go now to Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2268.151s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Did I do it right this time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2275.497s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No, I did not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2275.977s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You're number eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2276.558s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My apologies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2569.673s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2570.993s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll go to you next, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2573.634s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just want to echo Councilor Scarpelli's words, you know, really appreciate the collaboration to bring this out to the community and to kind of bring in all of the public engagement that's been done over the past several years into this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2589.079s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know it's tough, you know, I think with every project that we do, it's like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2593.42s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that does involve collaboration with the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2596.082s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's always part of me that's like, no, it's really, let's take five years to do, let's take 10 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2600.205s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let's talk to everyone, let's canvas the neighborhood, talk to every single person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2603.647s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Unfortunately, this contract does not cover that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2606.85s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I was taking some time to re-read over the RFP as I was looking over the presentation this past weekend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2611.693s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We know what we do have your support for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2614.755s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's not a new comprehensive plan for Salem Street, but we do have this bringing in what we know from the comprehensive plan of the three years that it took to put that together into this proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2623.785s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that in the RFP it mentioned as well, you know, a workshop in City Hall dealing with the neighborhood and we had kind of a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2632.613s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One version of that a few months ago with the zoning workshop before we got into the corridors in the neighborhoods and supplementing that with, you know, online meetings for the public for the benefit of the public, bringing the public into these meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2643.821s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I know for myself as one Councilor, I've been really glad that Steve from the mayor's office was able to help us out with shoring up our communication strategy to make sure that we're using the robocalls to get this out over more channels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2655.449s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm also going to hold myself accountable to do what I can on my own personal Councilor communication channels to make sure this tries to reach<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2662.433s">[Kit Collins]</a>: everybody that it can, and to keep doing that with every neighborhood and corridor that we do discuss over the next six months so really appreciate those comments and you know, let's do it we can behind the rail to supplement these coordinated public engagement strategies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2676.842s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for indulging me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2883.055s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2883.655s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Emily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2884.115s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Hillion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2885.176s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Alicia, did you have a direct response to that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2888.677s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2889.538s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then I'll go to you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2956.057s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=2958.159s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3024.705s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3025.645s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3026.786s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And yeah, I think it's,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3030.498s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think to the extent that we can, you know, as soon as there are questions and comments, whether it's from Councilors, as we continue to look through the draft, as we look through the updated amended draft that we'll see next week, and as soon as there are questions and comments from constituents, whether it's at this meeting next Wednesday, in between the two, you want to contact any of the Councilors or myself as chair, and I can certainly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3051.548s">[Kit Collins]</a>: ferry questions along to NS associates or the planning team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3055.171s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's, it's very okay and good to front loads those questions as much as possible so that they can be considered and incorporated earlier in the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3062.376s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But the great thing about amending the zoning ordinance is that procedurally we have to have so many meetings on it, even after it gets referred out of committee where we'll have lots of like in the weeds conversations like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3073.023s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you for reminding us all about all the steps that come after this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3078.545s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So speaking of next steps in terms of potential changes that might be made on the zoning consultant side for next week, I heard that there's going to be some typos in the parking table that might be tweaked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3092.468s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Can we expect to see a more finalized version of the inclusion and the incentive zoning that might apply to next use one and two by next week as well?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3100.991s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Or is that going to come later?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3134.918s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Excellent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3135.559s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So next week we can expect more discussion on this proposal to stay more finessed and some typos removed version of this Salem Street zoning proposal and that's next Wednesday 6pm our regular meeting time for this planning and permitting committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3150.254s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'd like to go to public participation unless there are any more questions or comments from councillors at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3157.702s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing none, we can start in person then I'll go on zoom so you can just walk up and form a line behind microphone and everybody has three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3166.226s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3168.947s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My first name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3299.805s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for your comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3301.166s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't want to go point by point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3303.707s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate you putting this all on the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3305.568s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I will say, if you want to have a really close look at where certain heights are enabled and where other heights are enabled, the proposal that the consultant showed on the screen, that's available on the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3322.475s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No, no, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3322.755s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I mean, you can go on your own time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3323.936s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You can pull it up and you can take a really fine tooth comb and look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3326.498s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I will just say, I know that a lot of the potential heights, minimum heights, maximum heights are based on the heights that are already present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3339.146s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Gotcha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3339.386s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well, I'd say this, feel free to send me an email.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3342.768s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I will download them and send them right back to you so that you can take a look.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3364.872s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't want to go back and forth with you with the people who are waiting, but I will just say I think Salem Street matches the characteristics of other parts of the city that have this mix of residential, thriving businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3374.615s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's a main thoroughfare.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3376.215s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think a lot of care is being taken to make sure that it preserves its residential character while supporting businesses and businesses that want to take root on that corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3407.026s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Gotcha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3407.786s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for your comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3408.847s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3409.367s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have to go to the next person now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3410.887s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3411.128s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3412.788s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're going to switch between podium and Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3415.149s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you for waiting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3415.95s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're going to go first to Dave on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3419.271s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3483.046s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you, Dave Peller Emily, could you quickly speak to the characteristics of the commercial if there's any.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3490.331s">[Kit Collins]</a>: residential involved in commercial sub district in Salem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3538.749s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3539.149s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Paula.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3539.749s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And Dave, to your first question, I think that the incentive zoning, I believe, is already drafted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3545.57s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That was part of the Mystic Avenue corridor proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3547.531s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So it looks like that's going to look pretty much the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3550.291s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think the characteristics-wise, it's just what that minimum and maximum height would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3553.532s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3593.174s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well, thank you, Paolo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3593.974s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, in short, it's kind of that exchange between what we're willing to say, hey, ordinarily you can't do this, but if you provide this great community benefit that we've decided is highly valuable and residents really want, then you're able to do a little bit more than developers ordinarily can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3608.359s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's incentive zoning in a nutshell, and page 15 and 16 of tonight's agenda, if you want to take a closer look.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3615.287s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll go now to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3743.923s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, we're going to toggle back to Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3749.848s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Rebecca, name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3751.69s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3752.691s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3866.892s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3867.253s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for your comments, Rebecca.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3868.593s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll now return to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3869.853s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3871.074s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3904.73s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you very much for your comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3906.671s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll go down back to zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3916.867s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is there any more?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3917.707s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, it's back up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3919.068s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Spoke too soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3919.908s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Jennifer, name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3921.309s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3923.67s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3962.165s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you very much for your comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=3963.465s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Director Hunt, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4085.151s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Alicia, and thank you so much, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4087.892s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's a great reminder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4088.972s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's something that I remind myself throughout this process, even though we've been talking in quite a lot of depth about zoning, you know, for more than a full calendar year now, is that zoning is counterintuitive because it seems like we're talking about what's going to happen when we're talking about what's going to be allowed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4104.398s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think Salem Street is a really great example, and there are examples all over Medford, but it's a great example of where what is currently there<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4112.601s">[Kit Collins]</a>: might be allowed under our current zoning, or maybe not, and we're having a conversation about what that's currently there, do we still want to be allowed, and we're done with this, but we'd not want to be allowed, like, I think there's broad consensus against the 12-story hotel, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4125.305s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think everybody's in favor of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4127.165s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And what do we want to be allowed that isn't allowed currently, so that the businesses are there, are even more thriving, that the residences are there, it's an even cozier neighborhood for the folks that live there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4137.989s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4177.428s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for that clarification, Councilor Galleon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4181.27s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing no further public participation on Zoom or in person and no further questions or comments from Councilors, we do have a regular meeting to get started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4188.735s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just to once again restate our next steps, we're going to be talking about this exact zoning proposal again next Wednesday at 6 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4196.759s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Please feel free to help us in spreading the word and we're glad to have the collaboration of the mayor's office and spreading the word on social media and through robo calls to residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4206.304s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, this process has been informed by the past several years of public participation on what they like and what they want to see for Salem Street and other areas around the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4215.309s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and these conversations, you know, in the here and now have to be informed by all of our voices as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4221.071s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4221.792s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we're going to see this 6 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4224.653s">[Kit Collins]</a>: next Wednesday, whenever it gets referred out to the City Council, it will then be referred to the Community Development Board, and then it will be referred back to the City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4232.596s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I just say that over and over again every meeting to remind you of all of the opportunities that we welcome you to be a part of this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4242.16s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4242.46s">[Kit Collins]</a>: 7-12, do we have a motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4247.421s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to adjourn by President Bearsar, seconded by Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4251.167s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4251.728s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4252.97s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4254.232s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4254.873s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4255.594s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Please stick around for the regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P82XV_Xc9RI&t=4257.136s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Innocent Associates, Danielle, and Alicia.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=387.148s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=388.809s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm excited to be able to say congratulations to you all in person, state champs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=393.312s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Wow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=393.712s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That is really amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=395.233s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for all of your hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=398.194s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I lived with a rower during college and they have to be the fittest athletes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=401.636s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I can't believe how early you guys must wake up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=403.738s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just our heartiest congratulations on this really major achievement and for doing Medford proud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=409.461s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1141.433s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to take resolutions under suspension.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1145.556s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1159.725s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to take resolutions under suspension.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2222.462s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2223.844s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm motioning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2225.225s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motioning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2226.486s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is that right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2226.946s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Moving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2227.487s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Moving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2228.217s">[Kit Collins]</a>: God, I knew that didn't sound right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2230.639s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Geez.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2232.221s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Anyway, I am moving to send the existing Community Control of Public Surveillance Ordinance, which was passed last term, to the Public Health and Community Safety Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2244.791s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This ordinance was crafted and collaborated on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2247.954s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in the previous term because the city, the council, and residents had a shared concern and a shared interest in the civil liberties of residents, transparency in our governmental decisions, and a shared interest in making sure that our very precious city dollars are spent on true public safety and not on expensive gadgets and softwares that enrich corporations more than they actually help communities and residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2273.663s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So to that end, some residents have identified potential changes that we could make to this rather new ordinance that would make it even stronger and even more in line with those shared goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2284.072s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I look forward to reviewing those comments, perhaps making some tweaks and having this discussion in committee where we can really get into the details and make this even stronger than it already is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2295.761s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2313.418s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2370.513s">[Kit Collins]</a>: To continue the public hearing to our next regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3314.774s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3316.055s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Lazzaro, thank you so much for putting this forward and to all of the collaborators from the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3321.3s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that we have been hearing from safety advocates in the community for a long time about this, and I'm glad that we're doing this one small step towards a potential solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3335.252s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this one is really simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3336.573s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, we have a 25 mile per hour speed limit on city managed roads for a reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3343.498s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We struggle to maintain and enforce that speed limit on city roads as it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3348.523s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I heard a couple speeding complaints from residents twice in the past two days, and that was before the meeting started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3354.447s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then we heard about more traffic issues on Salem, about the lack of safety on Salem Street as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3359.812s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we really need the state's help in creating a culture of safe road speeds here in Medford and around the region, because it's just intuitive, you know, people whip on the roads in Medford, they whip on the state roads, and they bring that speed to the neighborhoods, and it's incredibly dangerous, it's incredibly scary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3377.142s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I hope that this will send a really clear message to DCR and DOT that Medford wants this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3386.731s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We do not want this fast traffic from these state roads bleeding into the neighborhoods anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3392.436s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you so much for putting this together and thank you so much to everybody in the community who's been raising the alarm about this as well for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=1006.279s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3753.721s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3754.562s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Can folks hear me okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3757.105s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3758.286s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3759.027s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3760.909s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you to the assessor and his team for this presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3765.478s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I will say I have a much easier time with this presentation now that it's my third time receiving it than the first couple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3770.481s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you, as always, for walking us through these technical and really important concepts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3779.007s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I certainly appreciate the discussion around the residential exemption as I do every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3783.689s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And this is something that we have a really, I think, nuanced and important conversation every year around this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3792.074s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Because we want to consider, you know, this tool is a tool that exists, it's appropriate for some communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3796.617s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think it's really important to consider, is it something that would be appropriate for Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3802.32s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is it something that would be appropriate for Medford now or in the future?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3806.141s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What's that point at which kind of similar to the break-even point that we have to consider that the residential exemption itself would create?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3814.386s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think for me, you know, based on the data that's been presented,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3818.482s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Where I come down is similar to in previous years when we hear about that breakeven point we know that a residential exemption would benefit a lot of people who really deserve it, and we know that it would disadvantage a lot of people that would also really deserve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3828.83s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that we should absolutely continue to gather more information about what exactly this would mean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3834.194s">[Kit Collins]</a>: for our community and as, you know, the character of our parcels evolves gradually each year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3840.477s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But it's so important to get this right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3843.279s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And, you know, as we know from other parts of this discussion, you know, those little changes make a really big difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3849.342s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so I don't have any specific questions on the presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3853.304s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I would just say, you know, kind of on that point of where can we do<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3857.998s">[Kit Collins]</a>: where can we help legislate for the most benefit and the most help to our residents as we're contemplating the split in the tax limit?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3868.183s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, for as long as I've been on the council, and I think for longer before that, we have adopted the maximum split rate, which shifts the burden onto commercial, industrial, and personal property, and maximally, as allowed by state law, away from residential properties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3883.791s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And after discussion,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3886.392s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm a fellow councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3887.233s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I certainly don't want to rush this discussion along, but I would be happy to make a motion to adopt the split rate of 175% so that we can continue to shift the tax burden maximally away from residential taxpayers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=3901.785s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thanks again, Ted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4564.602s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4663.541s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4697.953s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4713.121s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5735.4s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5783.964s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=299.882s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=323.136s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would move to table to the next regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=326.318s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=326.939s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I didn't have a chance to review them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=378.52s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears and I'd also like to thank Vice Chair of the committee Matt Leming for chairing this meeting on my behalf at this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=386.522s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The draft proposal for the green score ordinance was reviewed by the committee and reported out to a regular session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=391.764s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=392.304s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I move to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=579.316s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1372.989s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1927.403s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1928.444s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanted to quickly thank Director Blake and his team for their work with Blue Bikes here to for in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1937.731s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I understand that this requested contract extension is part of a kind of coordinated regional effort so that not just an effort, but that in more of our adjacent communities, people can have an easier time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1951.162s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the bike share network and using that not only to get in and around Medford, but to surrounding communities and back for play and for commuting and for other purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1961.249s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm happy to be a part of the effort of streamlining that process in Medford and beyond, and I would motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1968.215s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2186.218s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=48.686s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Test one two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=55.768s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Test one two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5331.527s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let's see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5334.568s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5335.368s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you President Bears and I wanted to thank Councilor loving for researching the implementation of the new heroes act and for putting this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5342.53s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm really proud that over this term and the previous term the city council has worked to make sure that the city of Medford is maximized out on all of the tax exemption programs that are offered to us by the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5353.952s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so I thank the Councilor for his quick work on making sure that we adopted this one too, so that we could extend tax exemption benefits to veterans in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1143.2s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears for putting this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1144.8s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also corresponded with Mr. Bohannon a little bit after he emailed the council and just wanted to reiterate, he was truly so grateful to the two DPW employees who went out of their way to help them out of a, you know, a sticky situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1157.984s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it was so nice to get such a heartwarming letter about somebody saying, you know, this is what I know to expect from civil servants in Medford and just going out of his way to thank them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1168.007s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I extend those thanks to our DPW and those two gentlemen in particular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1408.423s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears at the planning and permitting meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1411.703s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Last week we met once again with the council's zoning consultant and associates we reviewed the latest draft of the zoning proposal for the mystic Avenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1423.687s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Trying to get the new acronym, the mystic have Valley District, which is on the city council agenda tonight for us to report out to the Community Development Board which is procedurally the next step in any zoning amendment process so we had a discussion and then we voted it out of committee motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2172.11s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2172.87s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I also want to appreciate the petitioner for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2175.771s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's really important for us to use this forum for folks to have that additional opportunity to say, here are my concerns with the RFP in general, this zone in general, this project in general.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2190.095s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think there's absolutely, you know, we thank you for, you know, again, voicing how important it is for, you know, everybody who needs access to the senior center and any, however they get there, whether it's by bus or by shuttle, by carpool,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2201.758s">[Kit Collins]</a>: or by driving themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2203.819s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The senior center is so important to Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2206.361s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm heartened to see, you know, in the mayor's, in the memo from the planning department that that has been reiterated to some of the development, sorry, some of the developers who went on that site walk, that that's been said to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2217.949s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think it's important that we, you know, continue to reiterate this priority, which is a priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2222.592s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have to make sure that people who need access to the senior center can continue to access it how they need to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2229.197s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we'll continue to help you emphasize that, and thank you for speaking to your concerns today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4306.607s">[Kit Collins]</a>: To revert to the regular order of meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5259.786s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Nothing major for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5260.587s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just want to thank the chief for spending some time with us tonight and for answering our questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5374.5s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears, I won't go into this and, you know, granular detail because it's been discussed so much in committee and because the council will, because the community will have a couple additional public hearings to really dive into the details if they so choose at the Community Development Board meeting which I believe to scheduled<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5391.87s">[Kit Collins]</a>: November 20 is the date that's been penciled in to review this zoning proposal before it comes back to the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5398.897s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But just before I make the motion to refer to the Community Development Board which again is just procedurally the next step that we have to take before we consider taking a vote on any zoning change to our zoning ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5412.45s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As president bear said we've had many meetings on this district in the planning and permitting committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5418.714s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a really exciting juncture for me personally as one Councilor because over so many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5428.76s">[Kit Collins]</a>: with people in Medford, you know, not just people in City Hall, but just folks out on the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5433.461s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It comes up so often, how much potential Mystic Ave has and how people look around and say, you know, what's here is really great, but we know this can be so much more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5443.304s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We see a lot of flatland, we see some vacant buildings, we see some lots that seem underdeveloped, and people can see the potential there for things that it's interesting for residents to go to, lots that will be really interesting for developers to want to develop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5458.189s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And in, you know, a lot of potential new commercial growth for our city which I know is really important to all of us and a really shared value for all of us to grow our commercial tax base though so that we can grow without.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5470.672s">[Kit Collins]</a>: having to levy all of that burden onto our residential tax base.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5474.956s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So with a lot of the goals, those goals in mind, and with the comprehensive plan, you know, guiding our beginning of this process, we took a look at this district, our zoning consultant was able to propose kind of a slate of sub districts that would make sense for different parts of this corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5491.79s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Of course, this corridor is very heavily commercial, heavily commercial, heavily commercial industrial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5497.514s">[Kit Collins]</a>: ended about some residential areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5499.015s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we took a lot of care in discussing what parts of that corridor, the north side closer to Medford Square, what type of mixed use involving commercial but not explicitly commercial makes sense for that zone as you get down further south towards Somerville, towards some of the more residential areas, what makes sense there, what's going to be good for development, what will buffer those residential areas from the commercial development that we hope to see there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5523.324s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we took a lot of time with those questions<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5526.145s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm very proud of the collaboration and the updated proposed zoning map that's come out of that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5534.167s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Of course, all those nitty gritties, the dimensional standards that inform what we're proposing that developers can develop there in each sub-district, depending on the conditions of the sub-district and other incentives that they may or may not take advantage of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5549.63s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All that to say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5551.09s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's a lot of weeds for people to dig into and I really do recommend that folks watch the meetings of the planning and permitting committee where this was discussed, or attend the Community Development Board meeting on what I believe is going to be November 20, if you want to have an even closer look at some of those details.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5568.82s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I do want to thank the committee for going through this process I think this is a really important part of the zoning overhaul that this council has been really working very hard<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5578.025s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to make progress on for this entire term and the previous two councils including the one that I wasn't on yet was working really hard to do this zoning work so that the, the things that residents of the community and business owners of the community have been asking the city to move on for such a long time that we're, you know, starting to make some real progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=5596.612s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So on that, I would motion to refer this to the Community Development Board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6620.716s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6621.276s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for flagging those Councilor Callahan I know that for, for myself even having spent a lot of time with these documents, it is a lot of material, so thank you for the close read.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6632.802s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanted to note and again this doesn't pertain to the motion that we're making tonight which is just to send this along to the next body which is, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6640.645s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The, the board members who will again look through this for a fine tooth comb but just on the, on the community engagement piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6647.408s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just didn't want to speak to that again, quickly, just to note that I think, I think it's really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6652.99s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And when I speak to what we're what we're doing and what we've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6655.751s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's on any topic not just the zoning it's it's not because I'm trying to make the point that, you know, we're doing a B and C so you know we got a 100%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6666.295s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and we're perfect and we shouldn't do anything more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6668.676s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think as public servants we always aspire to, you know, in our fantasy version of our jobs we would talk to every single person and of course we can't do that, but I think it's really important that we always aspire to be catching more people, to be going into these projects with the assumption that everybody might have an opinion and if they do then it should be heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6691.753s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think what is, you know, it is genuinely challenging and this project and many others is that we take that ideal that responsibility to incorporate as much public feedback as we possibly can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6705.477s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we have to reconcile that with what we can do and what we can say to residents that we are doing so that we're consistent, and so that they have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6715.1s">[Kit Collins]</a>: realistic expectations about where to find us and how we'll find them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6719.124s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So when I say you know I think after the last meeting we had some conversations with the zoning consultant to say, Okay, we've gone through, you know, kind of one and a half zoning packages now we have this proposal we have the proposal of kind of more technical tweaks that we put forward around the end of the fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6734.997s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Now we're kind of in our groove.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6737.219s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know it's really time to bolster this what what more can we do so that it is so that it is as it should be easier for folks to get involved easier for more people to know what's coming up further ahead of time because that's really important, that is really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6754.184s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And to me, you know what it says, when it comes to, you know, the one proposal to what's ahead of time let's make a schedule for what we're talking about in which month, so that we know so that the city staff knows so that residents can know essentially kind of have this more save the date type format, so that folks can know and really prepare and say okay I have that date in my mind if I want to attend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6775.569s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll be sure to attend, which is not to say that that's the perfect forum for feedback or that it should be the only forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6784.233s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Knowing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6787.506s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are a city council in a city that does not yet have the resources for robust public engagement that we want to model ourselves off of that other neighboring communities do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6798.108s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that gives us the opportunity to at least be expanding our reach by being able to say ahead of time, here's the meeting on this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6806.39s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If it's relevant to you, please save the date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6808.871s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If this format isn't doable for you, you have at least a month to let us know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6813.152s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If you can't get to this meeting,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6815.732s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let us know send us an email call us if you're a person who has to be engaged in your community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6820.376s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let us know so that we can find a way to accommodate and come to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6823.778s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What I'm trying to say is, I know that in the scope of this project with so much to cover it might not be, we might not be able to do what I think we all want to do, which is to have multiple community meetings in every neighborhood for every topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6836.828s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We can aspire to that I hope that we can do that especially in some of our more residential neighborhoods, where a lot of care has to be taken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6843.493s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But especially to me as committee chair it is very important that we are able to tell people what to expect and that do that consistently because I think that is really important for access as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6853.401s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just to note that for going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6855.342s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm excited about the, you know, expanded messaging that we're going to be doing as we head into the new year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6865.049s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just to reiterate that, you know, we're, I'm really grateful to be guided by so many plans that were created in collaboration with the community over the course of years that lay the foundation for everything that we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6876.935s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that, you know, it shouldn't go without saying that having the community involved in this process is really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6885.219s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think as public servants, we're always trying to think about realistically how to do that better and better every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=6890.382s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7150.36s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm happy to defer to Director Crowley if she would like to present first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7299.12s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for being present, Director Crowley, and for answering our questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7303.622s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm always happy to see a contract get resolved and always happy for the opportunity to approve and to waive the second and third readings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=7549.983s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8695.842s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Commissioner for being with us tonight, just to again paraphrase this to make sure that I haven't taken a look at that site as well in anticipation of the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8704.947s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just to make sure I have a correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8710.365s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This transfer of the paper way would allow to Joseph Street to reconstruct the retaining wall, which fell down earlier this year and transferring<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8722.745s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Transferring one half the rates would allow them to do that and transferring the rights on the city side would remove us from liability so that they could go about and do their construction in a way that wouldn't implicate the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8732.707s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it's not like we're going to build a city road on that paper way anyway, due to the grade, it would be dangerous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8739.108s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that wouldn't come about in the future anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=8741.889s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=23.712s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I can't show you anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4389.973s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4390.253s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll just keep this pretty brief and high level because the City Council has had a lot of meetings about the issue of private roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4399.776s">[Kit Collins]</a>: City Council has had quite a lot of meetings about the issue of private roads in particular over the past three years that I've been part of the Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4408.936s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What I have learned is that for the city to adopt what is currently a private road is an incredibly expensive process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4414.56s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Obviously, the cost of private roads is expensive to residents, while it's still a private road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4421.625s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For it to become a city on a public road, it has to be fully bought up to par, which is incredibly expensive on the order of millions, so that it can be maintained according to the status quo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4431.043s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that we all know that to improve the city's street canopy, to do that stuff removal that residents have been asking for, that city staff have been trying to do over so many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4440.969s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The point I'm trying to make is that we know that these needs that they're not being filled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4444.551s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've been trying to make headway on them for such a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4447.253s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The reason that we're not making the headway that residents are really dying to see is because they are so expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4451.915s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And to me, that underlines the need to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4455.577s">[Kit Collins]</a>: use this as a pivot point to try and begin making the investments that will result in visible improvements in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4464.684s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Because we know that there are a lot of residents who would love to at least be on the path towards progress, who would love to see a new private road, be eligible for adoption, and would like to see a more actionable plan for bringing some of those tree stumps down to earth and actually see our tree county expanding in these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4480.895s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And UC Central, they are incredibly expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=238.26s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, we're going to get started in just a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=240.461s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Welcome, everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=283.424s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thanks for bearing with us, everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=297.503s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I believe President Bears will be joining us in just a minute, so we can give it another couple of moments for folks to get situated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=350.202s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please just let me know whenever you're ready.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=359.726s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=361.307s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, there will be a meeting of the Medford City Council Planning and Permitting Committee, October 23rd, 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=366.389s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This meeting will take place at 6.30 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=370.151s">[Kit Collins]</a>: by Zoom only due to early voting in the council chambers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=374.232s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=410.918s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=411.979s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Five present, none absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=413.38s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The meeting is called to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=415.763s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The action discussion item for this meeting is again 24-033 zoning ordinance updates with the Innes Associates team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=426.094s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=428.55s">[Kit Collins]</a>: an exciting moment in our journey through our zoning update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=432.114s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have been meeting, of course, with our zoning consultant and associates since the beginning of this term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=440.424s">[Kit Collins]</a>: beginning in July with our mapping workshop, we started our targeted discussions of the Mystic Avenue corridor district, discussing that through July and August, and having more tweaks and changes to the draft proposal over the past couple months with a lot of input from city staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=461.771s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've been continuing those last changes in committee over the past couple meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=467.753s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and tonight I believe that we have a mostly finalized proposal that the zoning consultant has put together for us that councilors got a chance to look at over the weekend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=477.717s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think the intent for tonight is for us to have a final discussion of the Mystic Avenue Corridor District in this committee before it goes out to review by a procedural step at a regular meeting of the City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=491.261s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and then review by Community Development Board before it again comes back to the City Council for another hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=497.644s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we have a short list of the specific pieces of the zoning proposal within the package that Councilors received in their agenda packets last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=512.19s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That kind of break down the proposal into its constituent parts in terms of how it fits into our zoning bylaws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=517.933s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm happy to run through those, but I'm sure that our city staff from the planning department or Emily or Paola from Innes Associates could do a more elegant job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=527.117s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also want to make sure that we touch on the timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=529.918s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, just again, we've been doing this at every meeting, but just to again, kind of recenter ourselves and how we got here at this step in the, at this stage of our timeline, going from several years ago with these kind of goals and visions being formed through our housing production plan and comprehensive plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=547.319s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, so I would be happy to, um, recognize, um, Director Hunt or, um, Emily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=551.002s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um if either of you would like to start us off an<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=576.604s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=577.325s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I'm happy to pass it off to Director Hunt or Emily after a note from Councilor Scarpelli to orient us to what we're reviewing tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=585.833s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But first, go ahead, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=657.714s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that a couple ways to answer that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=659.956s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that there isn't a plan to have community meetings in between this meeting and when it goes to the regular meeting of the City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=667.443s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I will say that everything that this proposal is based on was really forged<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=673.909s">[Kit Collins]</a>: through robust community engagement really over the course of years between city staff planning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=681.595s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Pardon me, I'm speaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=683.056s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That was forged through the comprehensive plan formation, which was a year's long community engagement process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=689.501s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also know that there were certain parts of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=692.583s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the Mystic Avenue Corridor District proposal that we actually pulled back on because we decided that there hadn't been enough robust community engagement when it came to including certain residential streets in that corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=703.951s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We decided we're actually not ready to pull the trigger on that without engaging those specific residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=708.255s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we've been really conscious of the community buy-in aspect throughout this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=715.48s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And of course, you know, we've been really doing our due diligence over these past few months of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=723.445s">[Kit Collins]</a>: we are doing on the mystic Avenue quarter district proposal in this committee and giving the public every opportunity to add to the community feedback that was already given over the course of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=734.407s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um on the concert him to on the sorry on the comprehensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=738.328s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Planning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=739.448s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Process Um, so I look forward to continuing to welcome the public into these<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=748.75s">[Kit Collins]</a>: this committee is working on and that residents are really, really welcome to part of this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=753.431s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But at this point, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=755.552s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that I'm excited to get excited to hear from our city staff and our zoning consultant on exactly if I can follow up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=762.794s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Excuse me, sir.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=764.495s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You can wait until I'm finished speaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=766.695s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=767.896s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think at this point, it would be important for us to first orient and what we're looking at today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=771.737s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want us to get oriented on what we're looking at today from, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=824.443s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm not sure what you're referring to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=829.945s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm just trying to chair a meeting, George.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=831.726s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm going to say it up top.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=833.267s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a working meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=834.447s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've had a lot of working meetings over the past few months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=836.448s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are not going to be interrupting each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=838.168s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I am the chair of this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=839.649s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I will recognize all participants, including Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=842.97s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I will not be interrupted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=845.211s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are going to go through the zoning memo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=846.812s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are going to have a respectful conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=851.256s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This process was informed by community outreach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=853.899s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That is a fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=855.18s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And if you had concerns about the specific way that we've been doing community outreach through this committee process, you could have brought that up at any time starting in July and not at the 11th hour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=863.948s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm just going to say that at the top of the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=866.049s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Now I'd like to recognize Director Hunt or Innes Associates to walk us through the memo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=874.048s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Madam Vice President, I'm going to give you one more time and then we're going to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=919.74s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=920.721s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1066.411s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1067.251s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll go now to Director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1069.652s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For clarity, George, you got to wait for me to recognize you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1072.133s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're going now to Director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1076.475s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Director Hunt, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1976.906s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Emily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1977.887s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1978.567s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for the overview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1979.488s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that this was a pretty substantial package that Councilors received before the weekend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1984.152s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know I've given it my review, clarified some things in the text.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=1989.977s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'd like to ask my fellow Councilors if there's any questions on this section that they want clarification on before we move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2000.566s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go ahead, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2156.679s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2157.179s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for the question, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2158.32s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for weighing in on that, Emily and Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2164.125s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are there any other questions from councillors on this section of the zoning proposal at this time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2173.737s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing none, Emily, anything else that you wanted to flag from other sections of the four main components of the zoning proposal?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2204.571s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2205.233s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2205.794s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2210.117s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Director Hunt or Planner Evans, is there any other, I know for myself, there's plenty that we can speak to that we've been speaking to in terms of the main headlines of what we're looking at tonight, how those fit into the overall zoning structure, where these elements come from, why they are important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2227.388s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've spoken about that before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2228.329s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm happy to speak to that again, but I'd like to defer to city staff first, if there's any other pieces of context or especially important points that you'd like to raise before we discuss our next steps on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2399.13s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2399.911s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2400.652s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that's a really important point that we have to do this work in sections because otherwise it just doesn't make sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2407.999s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's just not approachable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2409.361s">[Kit Collins]</a>: However,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2411.124s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, we can take these books back off the shelf.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2414.745s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All of these components of our zoning, like anything else in our code of ordinances, can be updated, can be amended, we can look at again, we can tweak, we can see what comes up later in this process that informs another change that we decide we actually want to make to the MACD, the Mystic Avenue Border District.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2433.032s">[Kit Collins]</a>: we might.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2433.953s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Find something later in the process that we decide something can be changed to bring more consistency to the citywide zoning map.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2440.716s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um there's I think it's I'm glad you are reminding us and reminding the public that even though we're kind of breaking this overall project into chunks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2450.86s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um that's not a door that closes and locks and all of these can continue to be considered in tandem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2738.578s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears, I think those I think those points are really well taken, and I think that it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2744.571s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2745.391s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that this is a really big job this committee has been attempting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2750.752s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The comprehensive zoning update just on the technical stuff is a lot for one committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2757.593s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And now that we've gone through a couple cycles of packages that this committee has looked at, I'm hoping that we can begin to shoulder a little bit more and pair our next package of updates with indeed improving and adding more to our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2772.956s">[Kit Collins]</a>: how we're communicating about it and how we're communicating about that to the public, to the councillors that aren't on this committee, to city staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2782.119s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it will help us keep on track and accomplish all that we hope to, to put out that more specific, well, we've put out specific calendars of what we hope to get to and when, and I think that what we need to do now, as you said, is to break that down to an even more granular level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2798.043s">[Kit Collins]</a>: this week and this month, we're looking at this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2799.864s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Two weeks later, we're looking at this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2801.745s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Here's the goal for that month, et cetera, to keep us on track and to make sure that residents, the public business owners, have the best possible chance of knowing, I think I might wanna weigh in on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2813.131s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, I'm gonna save that date on my calendar and make it really easy for folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2817.013s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go ahead, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2984.445s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2985.467s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I think there's a lot of things that we could do that would strengthen our signaling overall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=2992.926s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go ahead, Emily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3022.87s">[Kit Collins]</a>: great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3023.21s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Emily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3023.891s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I think that that would be a great candidate for, uh, the steering committee to look at in advance of the next committee meeting so that we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3031.815s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We already re center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3033.216s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, once the Mr. Court, Mr. Gavin Porter District is on its way, um, to the regular meeting and then the CBB and we can touch base on where we go from here and bring that back to the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3045.784s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3183.916s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3184.696s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3185.176s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3188.898s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3191.363s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have a great next step in front of us in terms of the zoning proposal before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3199.307s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think we have some really great suggestions for how to go forward with our work plan and also pair that with kind of some renewed efforts around how to structure that, how to be telegraphing that structure and what's coming down the pipeline better to all participants, to all stakeholders as we go on in this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3219.576s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Callahan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3292.964s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go ahead, Emily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3293.864s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And great question, Councilor Hillian.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3398.344s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Emily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3399.345s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Callahan, do you have anything else that you want to add to that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3407.733s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, sounds like a no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3409.134s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Leming, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3443.183s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3445.244s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Director Hunt, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3476.107s">[Kit Collins]</a>: great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3476.427s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3528.444s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3529.164s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3530.125s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Lohmann.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3530.846s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate that suggestion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3531.966s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's a good idea to bring another local expert in on that conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3537.65s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If there aren't any other specific questions or comments at this time, I think it might be valuable before we start talking about next steps, a vote on this package and where it goes after it leaves this committee, if that's how the vote goes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3551.219s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Emily or Paola, if you wouldn't mind pulling the zoning map up on the screen,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3555.081s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and just quickly giving us a walk through that visual brief description.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3558.543s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Again, I know this is materials we've all seen before, but just to have another look at the updated zoning map with the four sub districts and just to describe once again the characterization of each.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3574.532s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3654.822s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3655.482s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Paula.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3656.503s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Appreciate that overview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3658.904s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And again, committee members know this, but just for any residents that didn't catch the past couple meetings when we were also reviewing this map.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3671.246s">[Kit Collins]</a>: on a more, you know, kind of section by section basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3676.148s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This has gone through a couple of minor changes from the original proposal about a month ago, including, you know, finessing, especially on the southern side of the map, where MX3 ends and commercial begins, making that carve out in the commercial zone on the southern side of Mystic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3695.557s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the Hicks area, creating, yes, as Paola is highlighting, inserting mixed-use one, which seems more appropriate for that area, around the residential, the park, and the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3708.421s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just to highlight some of the small changes that this map went through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3712.922s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll recognize Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3754.26s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3754.48s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for the question, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3756.381s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just on that, in case it wasn't touched on this meeting, I'm not sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3759.063s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's my understanding that we are legally required to have that use allowed somewhere in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3764.568s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's not that we're going out of our way to make sure that adult use establishments are present on Mystic Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3769.091s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's just that we are legally required to have them be allowed somewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3801.558s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for that clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3805.148s">[Kit Collins]</a>: questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3805.408s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um if there aren't any other questions or comments on the updated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3810.351s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3810.951s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Planner Evans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3967.88s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Planner Evans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3968.62s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's a really important point to make sure that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3974.045s">[Kit Collins]</a>: environmentally unfriendly, highly pervious surface doesn't get inadvertently grandfathered in while we're waiting, you know, a short number of weeks, it sounds like for the green score to be able to be considered as a global strategy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3988.314s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3991.216s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any other questions or notes before I start discussing our next steps after this committee meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3999.36s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3999.48s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3999.7s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4000.661s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4002.682s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As is true of all updates to zoning amendments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4006.825s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4008.286s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Now that this has been considered in committee if it were to pass into the next step would be to pass it into a regular meeting with the City Council there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4016.072s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Procedurally it must be immediately referred to the Community Development Board for their review and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4026.839s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and then the two votes to codify it into our into our code of zoning ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4034.924s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that is another several slate of meetings that we will have to get the input of the planning board and to have it appear before the full assembly of the City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4043.649s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's three more times before it is fully codified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4049.053s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I always appreciate that in the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4051.627s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Zoning updating process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4052.688s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's really baked in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4053.489s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, there's really no way to avoid a lot of eyes on this highly technical, very important, very consequential changes, and I'm really glad that that is written into the procedure of how this gets done because, of course, we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4067.944s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This step is important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4068.704s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's very detailed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4069.325s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's very technical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4070.505s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have to get it right because what we're doing here is we're implementing the goals and visions of the community that was kind of enshrined in the comprehensive plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4078.55s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm grateful that we get to include a lot of hands onto this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4087.294s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any questions about our next steps in moving this package forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4096.147s">[Kit Collins]</a>: seeing none.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4096.767s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I understand that we have, you know, this short list of tweaks that the zoning consultant will consider in between now and when this goes to the Community Development Board, the changes that we discussed on this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4112.232s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we'll be sure in our steering meetings to make sure that those are surfaced and make sure that all those boxes are ticked off before this comes back to the City Council for those final two votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4128.444s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Do I hear, before I recognize public participation, is there a motion on the floor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4135.392s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll go to public participation first if Councilors want to think about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4144.283s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll recognize Martha Andres.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4147.046s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4248.479s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's all right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4249.999s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thanks, Martha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4250.66s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Really appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4252.08s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just to flag what Director Hunt put in the comments, we have these maps up on the website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4257.601s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They are kind of buried, so I don't falter for not being able to find them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4262.382s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's in the chat under phase two, October 23 meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4266.924s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's also attached to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4269.969s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the agenda for this meeting on the City Council's public portal, but I'm gonna, well, maybe we can chat about how to just reorder the items on the city's zoning website so that the most current materials are easier to find.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4281.071s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But those are online for you to check out if you'd like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4283.612s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4382.036s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4383.697s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Planner Evans, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4422.747s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Planner Evans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4424.068s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I appreciate the suggestion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4425.369s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4427.351s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And certainly we would want to give it a thorough look if that recommendation came back to make sure that it's appropriately cited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4440.342s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4453.348s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to refer out the draft zoning proposal to a regular meeting of the City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4461.732s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is there a second on the motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4470.796s">[Kit Collins]</a>: motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4470.936s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great seconded by President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4473.677s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Would you like to make your amendment motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4476.018s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4503.853s">[Kit Collins]</a>: second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4508.116s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That was a motion to refer the Mystic Avenue corridor district zoning proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4514.199s">[Kit Collins]</a>: To the next City Council regular meeting and to keep the main paper committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4520.583s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4521.284s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4553.866s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in favor, none opposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4555.827s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion passes and the zoning proposal of the Mystic Avenue corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4561.229s">[Kit Collins]</a>: District zoning proposal is referred to the next regular meeting of the City Council, and we will continue our work of, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4569.413s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Going through all of the zoning citywide in this committee in tandem with city stakeholders, the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4581.238s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to thank NS Associates for being here as always.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4583.859s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Emily and Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4584.859s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you to our city staff who have been very involved in this project from the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4590.441s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you to all the residents on this call for your attention to this project and for weighing in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4599.303s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are there any further motions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4607.449s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the motion to adjourn, seconded by President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4610.512s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4643.792s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4644.533s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Five in favor, none opposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4646.414s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4647.955s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you very much, everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4650.017s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1058.538s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'd like to thank Councilor Tseng for moving this project forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1062.581s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know, as was stated, this is something that the Council has been talking about for a long time, at least since 2022, when I know then President Morell was one of the voices calling out strongly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1073.829s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to make sure that Medford was doing all it could do to protect reproductive reproductive health care is wonder, as well as gender affirming health care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1081.914s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And of course this is a very new draft and we're going to continue to revise this in committee but just for my initial review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1087.037s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1089.518s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One of the parts of this that really stands out to me that I hope that residents kind of, that I think is very salient and I hope that residents, you know, hear about and understand in this proposed ordinance is the section and again, like draft section C that says no city resources, materials or funds shall be used to facilitate or aid any person seeking to prohibit criminalized sanction, et cetera, the person seeking this kind of care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1112.716s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that's really the point to me here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1114.737s">[Kit Collins]</a>: is that we, I think we know implicitly that it's not appropriate for city resources to be used towards such, you know, essentially extra legal purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1124.78s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that includes the time of our city employees as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1127.441s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm really proud that we're crafting a policy that enshrines that, and I look forward to continuing to revise this in committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1362.688s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, and sorry, just a clarifying question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1364.409s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think you already described this, but is the point of that new idea to ensure that pharmacies are complying with providing all of the reproductive health-related medication?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1372.676s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1372.856s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, cool, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1374.097s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I mean, I think that seems part of the theme of these three papers, so I'd be happy to take it up as part of the package.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1689.663s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1690.544s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just to jump in with, again, preliminary reflections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1694.085s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1694.425s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this is, you know, obviously there's a lot of groundwork to lay in terms of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1699.389s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Should we go forward where?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1701.211s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's kind of step number one in terms of visioning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1704.974s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Step number one in terms of implementation would be thinking through those questions of, how would we bring this about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1709.898s">[Kit Collins]</a>: How much would it cost?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1710.759s">[Kit Collins]</a>: How much would it cost to build?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1711.78s">[Kit Collins]</a>: How much would it cost to maintain, including putting another thing on DPWs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1718.418s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and using that people power.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1720.659s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's not at all to say that I think we shouldn't do it because it'll take extra resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1723.62s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that it's a really good idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1725.441s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's a really nice thing to offer to our residents and visitors to this city and to a lot of residents and visitors, it's also a necessary thing that we should be offering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1734.704s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And if this is a difficult project to implement, if it could take five to seven years to put together, maybe it'll take shorter, but maybe it'll take five years to put together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1745.768s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the will and the buy-in and the plans and the money to make this sustainable, then it is good that we're starting now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1751.814s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2017.913s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2018.314s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I support the motion, the amended motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2020.656s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just to further that point, I think that we're at early enough stages here that I'd be curious to hear perspectives from, Councilor Tseng mentioned Director Bailey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2030.405s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also suspect that this is something that Director O'Connor, even if it's slightly more out of her purview, would have some perspective on as this is a health<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2036.471s">[Kit Collins]</a>: health issue and engages with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2038.592s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sure that the prevention and outreach folks have some, you know, they deal with a constituency that would be one beneficiary of these facilities in addition to many, many more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2047.976s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All that to say, gosh, there's so many ways that like a CBA would go with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2053.179s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I mean, I was thinking like this might be the type of thing that we'd want to get the Chamber of Commerce's feedback on because I know that it is kind of a pressure that Main Street businesses have to deal with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2060.422s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We want your patronage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2061.762s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We don't necessarily want to be a restroom facility for people in public, though they need one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2066.044s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'd just be really curious to put this pardon me, um, to as many city staff as possible at this early stage because I wouldn't be surprised if we get a lot of support from a lot of different departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2077.109s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2101.371s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I think that we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2102.952s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've certainly made many motions in the past at committee meetings that present a idea proposal or a draft ordinance and send it out to department heads and encourage them at their discretion to get feedback from staff in their department or to just give feedback as department heads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2154.475s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2154.796s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'll just notice for the edification of Councilors that haven't done a ordinance process precisely like this before that for me in the past, at least, um, that process is often paired with simply, you know, as as sponsor of the ordinance reaching out to department heads one on one to have conversations about them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2296.633s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2296.993s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I appreciate the words from Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2299.935s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I also just want to note, again, we're talking about something, a project that we're at the very, very preliminary stages of, especially with the restroom facilities and public spaces, which is, you know, more logistical than just us crafting an ordinance and working with city staff to implement it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2316.868s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But also, this is part of a story tradition of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2321.091s">[Kit Collins]</a>: elected and city staff working together to bring online what are essentially logistical or capital expenses, which is a, you know, usually a multi year process, and we've approved some cap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2335.498s">[Kit Collins]</a>: capital expenditures from our stabilization funds recently that are kind of, you know, kind of tell the end of that story where these capital expenses have been requested and advocated for and discussed and budgeted for and plan for for years and then eventually we get the, you know that the planning and the funds come together and we're able to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2355.45s">[Kit Collins]</a>: them together and make an expenditure and bring something online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2358.052s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And in both cases, it's something that we know that we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2360.915s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's something that pertains directly to the existing needs of residents, and it takes a few years sometimes to bring it into implementation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2367.381s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I just see that as part of that same process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2369.603s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So again, I appreciate Councilor Tseng for bringing this forward, and I think that our discussions about this topic<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2376.229s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to make sure that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2376.709s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um are well worth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2377.25s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It will be well worth it to residents and visitors to the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2380.891s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um and the same for the ordinances that we're working on in concert to make sure that, um, people in Medford have fallen unfettered access to the rights that they already have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2389.856s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2573.396s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would just motion to keep all papers in committee and adjourn pending further comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2578.599s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=955.624s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=956.325s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for being with us here tonight and for all the legwork that you've been doing to get the FY 25 estimated valuations online months earlier than you otherwise would.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=965.791s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Really appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=966.671s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I appreciate that it helps folks get a clearer picture of what precisely their bills might look like in the future based on various<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=977.478s">[Kit Collins]</a>: how the votes go in various directions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=979.52s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just to make sure that I understand the information that's available, and it would be, is it on the Assessor's Department page or the Finance Department page on the city website?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1010.909s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1011.19s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So up until today, people can call your office or look on the assessor's department website webpage and find the webpage is going to be dependent on like, I'm going to try to get it up this week, but like, it's just however fast we can do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1025.423s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1026.26s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have the FY 24 based calculations and now you're expediting getting the FY 25 based valuations so that people can have even more clarity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1036.485s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1036.765s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well, thank you so much for updating that ahead of schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1038.686s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1823.786s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1824.529s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1828.319s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to add a disclaimer that I obviously sitting behind this rail on this date, I'm not a school committee member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1834.8s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't have that level of granular knowledge of the school department and the school department makes its own budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1840.641s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The city council does not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1842.102s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That being said, I have discussed this matter extensively with people in the community, with people involved in the schools, with school committee members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1852.524s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I understand that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1854.224s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, what we stand to lose if these questions do not pass includes, you know, some of the stuff that people involved in the schools may remember from when we had to cut the school's budget during the pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1867.679s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that includes eliminating positions, including teachers, nurses, behavioral specialists, literary coaches.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1875.568s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We lose the opportunity to add programming within the schools that supplement the curriculum that is state mandated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1883.713s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So, some programming that is really beloved by students and their families, such as arts and musical curricula.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1892.297s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We lose the opportunity to augment the student experience with those types of classes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1897.44s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We lose the opportunity to augment the student experience with more people in supportive roles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1905.625s">[Kit Collins]</a>: such as therapists, nurses, people outside of the classroom who are nevertheless there to make sure that students can thrive in our schools and achieve the best learning that they can?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1919.275s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1921.256s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These two questions combined also limit our ability to offer competitive and living wages to the many, many people who work in our schools and offer<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1931.823s">[Kit Collins]</a>: students the experience that they really deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1935.005s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We know that we need to be offering living wages to our teachers and paras and all school staff because it's the right thing to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1940.446s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We also know that we need to be able to do that in order to keep these people in our school system so that our students are served in the way that they deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1949.118s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This will also have impacts on building maintenance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3181.923s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3183.224s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate the discussion from my fellow councilors on this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3186.525s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I won't go into the topic of new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3189.146s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My fellow councilors have covered that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3190.947s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are very optimistic about how the council's current work on zoning and permitting, which we've been keeping up for two terms, will continue to accelerate new growth and augment the city's operating budget to the greatest extent possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3204.334s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do just want to note that on the issue of free cash, just to, I think,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3208.359s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Different ways of framing the issue are helpful for me, maybe for other people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3215.22s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's no secret that we accrued free cash over several years, and that was not dispersed into savings accounts where it could be used and spent on capital expenditures because our city, unlike almost every other city and town in Massachusetts, before this year did not have any stabilization accounts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3233.504s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Now we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3234.204s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That means that that money can go to the purposes that I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3237.225s">[Kit Collins]</a>: City staff and many residents really wanted it to be going to expected it to be going to all along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3242.548s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Things like capital expenses and also repairing our infrastructure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3246.49s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Putting aside some of that money that's already been allocated to things that people can see out on the street, helping our DPW and other departments improve life and do basic maintenance in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3255.474s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Even if you say, okay, let's forget some of those capital expenditures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3258.476s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let's pretend that we still have $25 million in free cash, just using an easy number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3263.29s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's one-eighth of the city's annual operating budget, which means, you know, if it's one-eighth, you can understand how quickly we would run through that if we were using that as things to plug the hole in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3273.975s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I do want to emphasize that doesn't include any capital expenses whatsoever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3279.618s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Going back to the resident's question on why now, I think it comes down to we know that free cash is not sustainable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3287.581s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We know that we're already full steam on new growth, but we need more and better funding and services for our residents now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3294.686s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think the question is, do we want to punish residents and students for past shortcomings by failing to invest now, or do we want to take this opportunity to start making Medford better for all residents and students in the public schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3427.807s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3429.108s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The financial task force was a group explicitly made up of elected to consider the question of what we would put before our elected bodies to deal with solutions around this problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3441.258s">[Kit Collins]</a>: However, I feel really comfortable in saying that all of the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3445.622s">[Kit Collins]</a>: above types of people, city staff, members of the community, were consulted in various ways, formally and informally, throughout this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3454.393s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Some that people talked to, some that members of the financial task force talked to while we were considering these matters that were discussed in our meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3462.183s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Some of that were explicitly consulted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3464.705s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And others that have just been part of this greater conversation around what should we do with about what should we do about chronic underfunding in Medford over the course of months and months and years and years of challenges that have led up to this year in which we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3479.477s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Working together to try to solve these issues once and for all, instead of having budget season after budget season, where the school budget is essentially held hostage by our inability to raise enough money to add to provide the services that residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3494.785s">[Kit Collins]</a>: students and teachers expect and deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3497.567s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I also just want to underline, again, that these ballot questions, every single resident, every single voter in Medford, whether you're a parent, a teacher, a union member, somebody who works for the city, who also lives in the city, you get to use your voice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3511.436s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You get to cast your vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3512.557s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You can vote yes on all three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3513.738s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You can vote no on all three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3515.019s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You can choose which ones you feel comfortable voting yes and voting no on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3518.141s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You are a part of this conversation because every single person who votes gets a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=3523.324s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4089.914s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4091.856s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Again, speaking as a member of the financial task force, I want to try to put this a different way because maybe I wasn't, I want to try putting this differently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4101.403s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The financial task force, this group of electeds, tasked with- And the chief of staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4110.911s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As the mayor's staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4114.189s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If I had a staff person, I probably want them with me taking notes as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4120.114s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Our assignment was to create a proposal for a political solution to a community-wide problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4126.18s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that is why this task force was made up of electeds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4129.242s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think folks who are asking the question, rightfully so, of why did you come up with what you came up with should<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4139.801s">[Kit Collins]</a>: look to the hours and hours of tape that we have the public meetings that we've had in this chambers between the city council and the school committee where we discussed that question in terms of why seven and a half million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4154.619s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Gosh, there's a lot of school committee meetings enumerating exactly what we cut in various different budget scenarios to back up why we think that this is the number that is at the nexus of what we know that we need and what we think that we can reasonably ask of the residents to strike that sweet spot between<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4171.044s">[Kit Collins]</a>: trying to maintain an equitable and deserved school experience for Medford Public School students with something that the community can be comfortable with and can say yes to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4182.393s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is our job as people who run for offices, instead of going to planning school and trying to get a job in City Hall, to try to come up with, for lack of a better word, political solutions to real life community-wide problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4195.804s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That is what the task force sought to do, and now everybody gets the chance to vote on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5033.681s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5035.001s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Not to put too fine a point on it, but I think we've all acknowledged behind the rail<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5040.879s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that we have problems this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5042.6s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And let's say hypothetically that our free cash was not already allocated to capital funds that our department heads have been advocating for in many cases for years and years and years and being pushed off because we didn't have the money to allocate towards those capital expenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5057.472s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And now we're finally able to start chipping away at that very, very long list of projects on our capital improvement plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5064.338s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let's just put aside that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5067.637s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and say, hypothetically, what if we still had unallocated free cash that we could use on an operating budget, which we don't because it's allocated to capital projects?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5077.041s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that there's a shared acknowledgment behind this rail that that does put us back at square one, and we have to revisit this conversation again in May for fiscal 26 with no better solutions than we do now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5089.566s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I've asked myself,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5091.852s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What would I cut if we then approaching fiscal 26 with no better off because new growth takes five to 10 years to really flourish into that robustly improved commercial tax base.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5105.555s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we haven't taken advantage of accelerating our tax levy so that we can try to get in fighting distance of where inflation has put us as a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5118.092s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And now we don't have the cash reserves that again are hypothetical at this point because we already know that we need them for capital expenses and we have to balance the budget for fiscal 26.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5127.715s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What would I cut?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5130.016s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's nothing to cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5131.176s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5310.994s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5311.274s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sure that my fellow councilors will add to this list, but just to reference some of the data points that have been coming up multiple times in this meeting in particular, I'd guide you to the pavement management plan that was put out by the DPW some years ago, and that's a few years out of date now, but it details the- It was actually updated last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5328.939s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, nevermind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5329.819s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Updated last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5331.219s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That details the $200 million in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5337.401s">[Kit Collins]</a>: backlog of road repairs that are needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5340.123s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For more detail on the needs in the schools, I would direct you to really any of the budget cycles, the recent budget cycles, school committee meetings, FY23 or FY24, which I think go into the level of detail that folks are really curious about when it comes to what is at stake, what actually does go on the chopping block each year, and that is brought back depending on ESSER funding, when that was available, or other one-time funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5362.429s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that the capital improvement plan is also a really interesting augment to those operating costs that show how much money really needs to be funded to on the infrastructural and maintenance side that we are really waiting to have the funding for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7486.193s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mine is related to a different part of the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7592.861s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, and just quickly to follow up on that, I'll note that, again, to echo what President Bears said, it's not within the purview of this council to have any input on the design of the fire headquarters, but I will note for folks who might be interested, on the city website under the fire department webpage, there are links to six of the concept plans that were published this year, which I think is interesting for folks, for residents who want a little bit more detail, because it actually enumerates what's different in each design from the one preceding it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7910.986s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7912.047s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, again, as a city council member, not involved in the school's department budgeting process, but I would just say, considering these questions,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7923.373s">[Kit Collins]</a>: thinking about the motives behind them in terms of the motives for community, the motives politically for putting these forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7931.682s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's hard for me to imagine, even putting on my cynical hat, what our gain could possibly be in putting forward<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7940.677s">[Kit Collins]</a>: a question that asks residents to pay more in taxes to then spend it on spurious things in the schools department when we know, because we hear from residents all the time, all year long in school department meetings, in school committee meetings and in city council meetings, the adverse effects on students and teachers and staff because of underfunding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7962.072s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And the ways that we want to see the school experience be better for students that we can't yet afford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7968.415s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's it's hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7969.735s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have no motivation to raise this money and then spend it on things that are not the things that the community has already been in some cases really begging city leadership to spend it on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7984.265s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm not involved in the weeds of the school's department budgeting process the way that the school committee is in the way that the school's department is, but there is, it's just impossible for me to imagine a scenario where this money will be spent on 30 seconds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8001.633s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8004.821s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The goal of doing this very difficult thing, which indeed is causing a lot of difficult conversations in the community, is to improve life for Medford public school students, life and conditions for Medford residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8018.344s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It would be... 10 seconds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8021.585s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It would be bizarre for us to spend it away on various things that weren't directly related to improving quality of life for residents and students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8681.817s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8684.56s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Obviously, there's been a lot said in this Q&A forum, and I just think that with everything else that we've been hearing, I also want to put on the record that we talked about the costs if the overrides should pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8697.174s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The assessor gave a great presentation earlier about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8700.356s">[Kit Collins]</a>: how costs will go up regardless, how costs will go up if seven passes, how costs will go up if both pass, et cetera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8708.463s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's significant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8709.824s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that is significant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8710.704s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that people should take it seriously and decide how they feel about it and if they think that they can afford it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8715.108s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And what if any exemptions apply to them and how those will work with them and call the assessor if they have questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8720.032s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also think that what also deserves a serious and honest discussion is how households and individuals end up paying out of pocket if we continue to not fund our public sector, if we continue to let our roads and sidewalks get worse and worse and worse, which is something to be taken seriously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8740.018s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is a safety issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8741.519s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is an accessibility issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8743.179s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If we continue to let our schools get worse and keep missing every opportunity to make them get better,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8753.203s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it is frankly condescending to build this discussion as nothing more than trying to scare people into voting a certain way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8764.205s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For the people who think, wow, what if the schools are no longer an environment where my student can learn or thrive?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8771.246s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I cannot pay for a tutor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8773.187s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I cannot pay for five-day school tuition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8775.467s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I am concerned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8778.388s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We should not be belittling that emotion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8780.575s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We should not be belittling people who are having to pay out of pocket every year for car repairs, because we can't take care of the most basic thing in our city in a way that makes it not quite so obvious when you drive from Winchester into Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8797.645s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The format of this discussion was supposed to be a Q&A session where residents can ask questions and Councilors could give answers to the best of their ability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8805.53s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I am pretty disappointed that it's turned into an event where certain Councilors are telling residents not how they should vote, but how they should feel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9307.898s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9308.258s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll be quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9309.139s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just a quick point of information because I know it's been said a few times tonight that the $500,000 would quote, fix the roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9316.463s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that as the published pavement management plan on the city website establishes that we have $200 million in a backlog of road repairs in the city, I think we're all very aware<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9327.529s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that half a million dollars is not going to fix the roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9330.79s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As it says in the text of the question, what this would do is enable the DPW to establish, as it reads, additional staff for road and sidewalk infrastructure repair, which relates to the in-house hot top crew that Councilor Scarpelli has been advocating for for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9344.216s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So Councilor, I'm sad to hear that you've reversed your position on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9902.296s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No, I mean, if you have more detail to add on the Cambridge Fire Station example, I just think that we covered this question earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10513.008s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10513.408s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just in brief, obviously we know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10517.418s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's really tough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10518.199s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we know that the student experience coming out of the pandemic when so much critical in classroom learning time was missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10523.184s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's really tough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10523.985s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's really tough for a lot of students feel for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10528.089s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I will just say that I know the topic of literacy coaches in classroom specifically came up a lot in school committee budget meetings and city council budget meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10539.08s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And as we were discussing, putting together these numbers for Proposition 7 and Proposition 8 specifically, because we know that that is such a need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10547.184s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One of my big concerns if the overrides don't pass is that we would not be able to bring online the literacy coaches that we know that students like your son really need more of in the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10558.31s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And if they do pass, we would be empowered to be able to have more of those coaches in the schools helping students make up for the time that they lost during the pandemic and just due to other factors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11568.814s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11569.234s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Appreciate the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11573.024s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I am normally actually and every single penny every single nickel counts type of person in my household budget, certainly, you know, we take every penny very seriously and municipal budgeting because this is our collective wealth to do with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11588.789s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in all of the discussions in public meetings, city council meetings, school committee meetings, task force meetings around what is the number that we should put forward that we're asking people to vote for to invest in the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11599.931s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I spent a lot of those meetings advocating for a much, much, much higher number than just 7.5 to be spread around the DPW and the schools and other expenses, but mostly the schools, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11610.293s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think when we're having those discussions that are essentially landing at this is the minimum amount that we can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11616.909s">[Kit Collins]</a>: try to invest in our schools to have to at least hold the line and prime the pump for them then getting better in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11624.331s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Maybe not even get better this year, but at least keep them from backsliding so we can hope to have them improve in future fiscal years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11632.454s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When $7 million is the scope of the investment, that is essentially the minimum for not backsliding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11639.576s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You put that against a 2% COLA for certain electeds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11644.372s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and bringing up other electeds to not even parity with that position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11649.773s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think if we're having an honest discussion, we can all look at that and say apples and oranges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11655.715s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm not trying to be disrespectful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11657.635s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's my honest opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12055.0s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you and guess on I realize I may have misunderstood your question um with what fiscal year you were talking about but I know that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12062.916s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Part of our discussion has been around the salaries that this year are currently on one-time funds that will expire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12070.119s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And putting forward the override questions as an on-ramp for those positions is, again, once that one-time funding that they're currently being funded by has been depleted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12080.542s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But in your clarification, I think that my point might have been usurped by something else that you were saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12091.038s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Only if you have one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12093.359s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No, I'm good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12324.554s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12325.374s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Really fair question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12326.194s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm glad that you asked it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12327.775s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In terms of what's directly within our purview as city councilors, I know for as long as I've been on the council, I'm in my second term now, we have been, I think, extremely focused on parts of our jurisdiction that relate directly to expanding commercial tax base, which is the ways that we can increase city revenue without going to residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12348.234s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've been talking a lot about our zoning project, especially recently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12351.074s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It didn't begin recently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12352.655s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've been fighting for, I think, three terms, since longer than I've been on the council, to be able to work with a zoning consultant to do really smart, tailored zoning that will allow us to grow the parts of the city that people have been wanting to see growth in for years, so that we'll see what we wanna see there, and also be adding to our commercial tax base.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12370.078s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we've been starting to do that, and we're already starting to see the seeds of results on Mystic Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12375.119s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Of course, that revenue isn't gonna come online<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12378.467s">[Kit Collins]</a>: until like a longer timescale than we really, that's not, we don't see the rewards from that in one year, we see that in five, 10, 20 years, but that is directly within our jurisdiction, and we've been extremely focused on this council, on laying the groundwork for commercial tax-based growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12393.988s">[Kit Collins]</a>: City Hall departments, I think, are really, one of the things that they're remarkable for is in grant-seeking, especially our Planning Development Sustainability Office, and I do know that every department in this city works really hard to get grant funding for some of its essential projects or other projects that we don't have to take those monies out of the operating budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12413.178s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The City Council, whenever we can, we support those grants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12417.08s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We approve when that's within our jurisdiction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12419.041s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We try to support<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12421.582s">[Kit Collins]</a>: resources, funding for projects coming from not from residents, wallets, essentially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12428.285s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In addition, then there's the advocacy side and people bringing up, what is the state doing about this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12433.267s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What is the state paying and how are other players paying in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12436.149s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We constantly advocate for an increase in trying to remember what this UGGA actually stands for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12443.012s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's unrestricted, like general aggregation, constantly advocating for the state to pay into cities like Medford<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12450.755s">[Kit Collins]</a>: more so that we can do more for our residents the way that the state would like us to do, constantly advocating for changes in the payment in lieu of tax agreement laws so that we can turn to institutions like Tufts and say, hey, you don't pay a lot of property tax, all of our other residents do, let's make this more fair, trying to pull what levers we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13215.882s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13216.122s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just want to thank you for being here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13217.862s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for your advocacy on this issue, and thank you for advocating for firefighters in general in Medford all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13226.184s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I understand that this is complicated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13227.404s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also know that as a city council, we approach this at different levels of distance from just the dollars and cents of the proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13234.944s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And from the specifics of the fire headquarters proposal that is being worked out between the fire department, maybe fire department leadership is more accurate to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13246.252s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And principally the mayor's office, we're not involved in that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13249.794s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I can say for myself as one Councilor that after hearing for so many months and years, this is an improved headquarters is urgently needed, urgently deserved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13257.541s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the fire department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13259.163s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, that that is trying to bring that about as expeditiously as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13263.428s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's my priority as a city Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13265.83s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, I know from, you know, just following the publications of the, you know, kind of continually updated concept drafts that's put out by the mayor's office that, um, you know, at least from what I from what I'm able to see, it seems like feedback is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13278.945s">[Kit Collins]</a>: continuing to be incorporated and updated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13280.846s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Again, I'm just sharing what's visible on my side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13283.147s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that there's another perspective that you represent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13287.57s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is my sincere hope from hearing that this is so urgently needed for so long that we are able to see a truly collaborative process that results in the fire headquarters that the fire department needs, deserves, expects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13304.719s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that we can move on with this urgency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13307.74s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And, you know, I think that that's just what the community needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13310.501s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Certainly that's what the fire department needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13311.962s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I hope that we can do that on a timeframe that we can move on it this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13316.924s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13801.986s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13802.326s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Appreciate the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13803.146s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Obviously, I'm going to give a highly subjective answer because this isn't really a policy question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13807.947s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, obviously, I'm really saddened to see<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13812.759s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well, let me start here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13814.359s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I really understand why people are so concerned about these questions from both sides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13820.461s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I see people saying, wow, my bills are going to go up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13822.701s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's really serious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13824.181s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I need to understand why that's being proposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13826.482s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I can also see people saying, wow, these things that these questions would pay for are really dire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13832.123s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We really need to make sure that these pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13833.823s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think people know which camp I'm firmly in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13839.173s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What does sadden me is seeing these two viewpoints, which I think are two positions that we can converse from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13846.215s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We can have discussions from those two poles and not experience division and not experience a crevasse in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13854.977s">[Kit Collins]</a>: To me, I think that we start seeing division in our community when certain people start saying, those people who disagree with you, they are against you, or they are against them, or this is pitting X against Y.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13868.886s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and convince people of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13874.011s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think that that's helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13875.673s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think that that is where we are to be totally honest with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13878.315s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that there's a lot of people who are deeply concerned and have had conversations that haven't been productive or have been offensive, but I actually do not believe at all that this community is divided over these questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13890.927s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I also just think it's worth noting that at the end of the day, we can have conversations and sometimes those conversations are unpleasant and sometimes those conversations unfortunately are hostile.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13900.536s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I just fundamentally for ever since we put these on the ballot in June, I am really confused why we are fighting about this because at the end of the day, these questions will be decided in November when we count up the number of people that voted yes and the number of people that voted no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13915.506s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think the people that are saying this is dividing you, they want you to feel divided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13920.67s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'd say, look at the motivations there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13923.172s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14707.066s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just echo what President Bears said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14708.647s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that these are questions that, you know, and we'd be happy to liaise as council leadership to set this up with the chief assessor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14714.69s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that he'd be able to give you much better information than we can on the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16860.213s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16861.454s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't have a direct comment to that last question that was made, but I really appreciate it, appreciate the resources that were shared as well and the recommendations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16869.32s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanted to note that it's quite a late hour and we actually have a second meeting to get to after this, so I would not motion, but request that we now proceed to public participation and then adjourn and take up the agenda items on our regular meeting agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=256.4s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for putting this forward, and I motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=272.589s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, it's in the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=285.084s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to join all the records and reports of committees and then take paper 24483 from the hands of the clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=400.558s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=402.219s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a hard one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=403.239s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's been hard over these past few months not having Larry with us in the chambers like he always, always has been for years and years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=411.823s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's hard to wrap my head around this, and it's hard to sum up so much of what Larry represented, but Larry was so kind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=427.833s">[Kit Collins]</a>: He was so generous with his insight and his experience from so many years of working in City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=433.816s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When I joined the Council three years ago, you know, I felt a little out of place, a little, a little new kid on the block.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=442.558s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And this is just one example of how unflaggingly kind a person Larry is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=447.822s">[Kit Collins]</a>: He never, ever treated me any different than any other Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=452.285s">[Kit Collins]</a>: He was kind, he was welcoming, he was welcoming, he took me seriously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=455.347s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know that that's how he treated absolutely everybody in his orbit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=458.93s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So he will be so missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=461.311s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I joined my colleagues in sending our most sincere condolences to his family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1578.293s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would motion for a moment of silence upon passage and also to dedicate this meeting in Larry's honor, though really he deserves a year's worth of council meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1640.139s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would motion to suspend the rules to take paper 24477.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1643.16s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On the motion to take paper 24477 and 24478 under suspension.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1793.793s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1867.355s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=1891.139s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to revert to regular order of business, and then to take paper 24457 from the table, to take both national grid papers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2115.61s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would motion to approve contingent on the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2119.69s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Conditions recommended by the chief engineer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2589.081s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2589.421s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Our first discussion was, I think, at least a month ago now, and it was a very late hour, so I apologize for any failure of perfect eloquence in my trying to summarize our previous discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2602.804s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My understanding is that the cable that needs to be repaired needs to be repaired, and the nature of the request for amendments largely deals with what area of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2612.463s">[Kit Collins]</a>: street will be repaved as a condition of that cable repair, is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2617.889s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sorry, say that again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2620.032s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My understanding is that the cable that needs to be repaired, must be repaired, will be repaired, and the nature of the amendments that National Grid has put forward has to do with what area and how much will be repaved while that cable repair is going on, is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2639.67s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2640.01s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2640.31s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2640.87s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just wanted to clarify.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2643.191s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Appreciate you being here again, especially at such a late hour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2646.112s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm so sorry to keep you and your team here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2648.713s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For myself, I think we had a really helpful discussion about a month ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2652.015s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I reviewed the memos from the city's lawyers, from National Grid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2658.458s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think at this point, I am feeling confident and standing by the amendments that the council in the previous term put forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2666.322s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I really appreciate the discussions that you've had with us about this, but I think that those current, those existing amendments and the council's rationale behind them for me feels as resonant as it did a year ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2679.048s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I would motion to deny the request for amendments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2908.262s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2909.362s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciated the discussion of this at our, I think it was our October 2nd committee of the whole, and I would motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=2964.93s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to take from the table, paper 23449 and 24458.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=3000.627s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to ordain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=3105.862s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to approve for third reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=38.322s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There will be a meeting of the Planning and Permanent Committee, October 9th, 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=42.124s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This meeting will take place at 6 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=44.766s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in the City Council Chamber, second floor, Medford City Hall, 85 George P. Hassett Drive, Medford MA and via Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=50.569s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=56.593s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=63.277s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=63.998s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Five present, none absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=66.619s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The meeting is called to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=68.823s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are also joined by non-voting members of the committee, Councilor Tseng and Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=78.953s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The action and discussion items for this committee are again paper 24-033, Zoning Ordinance Updates with the Innes Associates Team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=88.746s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The meeting notice writes that we are going to discuss the green score proposal, discussion of housing definitions, and general discussion of updates to the zoning ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=96.51s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're actually not going to be discussing green score proposal tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=100.152s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've discussed that in previous meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=103.074s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The zoning consultant is doing more work on that side of things before we bring it forward to this committee for another public discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=111.278s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that is one of many items that is in progress, but we won't be speaking about it this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=118.191s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For tonight, we are going to focus the conversation on two main discussion points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=124.514s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're going to revisit the housing definitions that were first circulated during the week of September 11.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=133.078s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't remember if that was the date of the meeting or the date that the meeting notice went out, but we have recirculated those housing definitions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=140.622s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And since we've discussed them before and Councilors have had several weeks to review, formulate comments and questions,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=147.912s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm hoping that that is a piece that we can consolidate all of our remaining questions, comments, requested subtractions, additions on, and get that to a condition where it's able to report out as part of the incoming package of updates that we've been working on for the past four to six weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=168.427s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just to finish summarizing the agenda for tonight,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=172.818s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are also going to discuss the zoning proposal for Mystic Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=179.062s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've gone over this in great detail in a couple meetings of this committee recently, and we're going to hear some, I think at our most recent meeting was when we reported out, sorry, at our most recent meeting, we approved some recommendations from the zoning consultant on how to move forward with zoning for Mystic Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=197.868s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I understand that there are some minor changes, suggestions, additions to what the council, what this committee approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=205.315s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we're going to review and discuss those this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=209.64s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think we're still planning to have those back in this committee on October 23rd so that we can hopefully report them out and get them on the pipeline where they will then be reviewed by the Community Development Board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=220.911s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I am happy to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=222.662s">[Kit Collins]</a>: turn it over to my fellow Councilors if they have any initial questions, and then to turn it over to our housing consultant to lead the discussion on the housing definitions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=237.327s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any comments or questions from Councilors to lead us off today?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=242.989s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=243.329s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In that case, thank you so much to NS Associates for being here with us once again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=249.611s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And Paola, I assume that we're going to be hearing from you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=252.013s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These are, again, these are housing definitions that we have seen before and reviewed before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=257.538s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So if members of the public are interested in the presentation on the housing definitions, that can be found in recordings of our previous committee meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=264.564s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Paola, if you want to give us the kind of 30,000 foot overview of what we're looking at here and why these are so important to put into our updated zoning, that would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=274.052s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then we'll move on to comment from councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=615.201s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=616.321s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll recognize Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=920.801s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=922.779s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=923.74s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=925.1s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Leming?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1272.918s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If I may, and to follow up on the point that Director Hunt was making about sort of what's important for this discussion on definitions in terms of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1284.298s">[Kit Collins]</a>: why we're updating the definitions before we update more of our zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1287.742s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And thinking about essentially like what are the semantic tools that we're giving ourselves with which to say we want this here, we don't want this here, we'd prefer this not here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1297.111s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think the point about the current Bedford dormitory definition is well taken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1301.496s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I mean, I would be amenable to perhaps<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1305.373s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If we want to make sure that we have a higher degree of control over where dormitories are being proposed and built, I think that we could strike the, we could have a just say building designed for residents, for students or staff if we want to have more control over where residences explicitly for student populations are within our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1325.551s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think that this is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1327.261s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think there's some definitions that we're going to consider right now and over the next few months that are like critical so that we can do other things on our kind of slate of zoning goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1336.346s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't know that this is one of them, but I think that that kind of change is in line with essentially what we're hoping to do with the definition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1345.431s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I would just offer that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1346.331s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I can't make motions as the chair, but that makes sense to me unless somebody points out what I'm missing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1354.656s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then it sounded to me like there were some<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1356.778s">[Kit Collins]</a>: some good ideas for updating the proposed definitions for co-living and co-housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1451.771s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I find that persuasive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1453.071s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And reading over the Cambridge definition, I do think that that kind of captures the intent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1458.273s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Personally, I would be amenable to adopting the Cambridge definition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1461.641s">[Kit Collins]</a>: replace our current one along with the other updates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1580.346s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that, um, I think it's fine to either motion things individually or to have the motion at the end of this meeting be to incorporate the feedback promulgated in the meeting and keep the paper in committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1589.992s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think we, if it's, it's, if it's helpful to have the clerk compile them line by line, um, just means that I don't have to take notes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1597.296s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think either way is okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1599.678s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Or it doesn't mean I have to take as scrupulous notes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1635.089s">[Kit Collins]</a>: it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1636.07s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1636.37s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is there a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1639.952s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is there a second on the motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1641.914s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, seconded by Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1646.977s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If there are not any other glaring questions or comments on the housing definitions, or are there any other glaring comments or questions on the definitions, Councilor Callahan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1676.925s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Halihan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1678.667s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's my understanding that once we incorporate the feedback that we just talked about on co-living, co-housing and the dormitories definition,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1687.691s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The rest of these I think are in pretty good shape.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1689.312s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've discussed this before, so I think the next time we see this, it'll be in the condition that we could take a vote to report it out of committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1695.914s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Emily Pella, I see nodding heads on Zoom, excellent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1700.516s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we will have, we will follow up with the exact language of the updates to co-living, co-housing and dormitories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1710.34s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1712.021s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let's move on to our discussion of the zoning proposal for Mystic Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1718.212s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just to recap, at our last committee meeting where we discussed the Mystic Ab Zoning Proposal, we looked at a lot of excellent visuals created by NS Associates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1730.138s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilors were shown kind of two versions of a zoning proposal that were based on the many meetings we've had to discuss Mystic Ab and also incorporated the many documents that kind of encapsulate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1743.217s">[Kit Collins]</a>: we did receive some City constituent Councilor feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1746.639s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On what we want to see from Mr. Gaff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1748.761s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um that kind of had a mildly different interplay between these two versions expressing different ways that mixed use zones and commercial areas could fit together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1761.309s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1762.329s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We reported out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1763.41s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1764.07s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I keep saying reported out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1764.931s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We approved one of them to go<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1773.226s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in conversation since that meeting, which I think was in the last week of September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1777.608s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it was the September 25th meeting, but I should fact check that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1783.491s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Between then and now, I think that city staff and its associates have discussed that draft map, and there are some minor changes to the plan that the committee approved that they wanted to brief the committee on before it comes back on the 23rd in a position that we can take a vote to report it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1802.034s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm happy to turn it over to Director Cohn if you want to start out or just kick it over to Emily and Paola to give us that update on what's changed since we saw it last.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2043.539s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2044.139s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for that update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2045.32s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And yeah, just to recenter on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2047.142s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So what's changed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2052.162s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let me get my cardinal directions right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2053.642s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That blue zigzag, that was the recommendation of this committee at our last meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2058.343s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The change that's being proposed newly as of this meeting is the section towards the south side that's split between pink and purple, which is mixed-use three and commercial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2068.126s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The new recommendation is to have commercial on that side at all as opposed to mixed-use three all the way down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2073.267s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2329.816s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2330.496s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2331.076s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2332.277s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2332.958s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But yeah, thank you for entertaining this exception.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2334.659s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this makes<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2481.104s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What about Planner Evans?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2524.126s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2524.586s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Do we want to entertain a change to this person as well?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2636.667s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Halihan, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2637.448s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2791.503s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2792.163s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So interesting discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2796.129s">[Kit Collins]</a>: as chair all the way to motion if we're going to propose a further tweak to that zone or leave as is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2803.791s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I do want to hasten us to what I believe is the last piece of our discussion for the Mystic Abzoning proposal tonight before it goes back to Innes Associates for, you know, to wrap up all of these final tweaks and comments so that we can take a vote to report it out on October 23rd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2823.135s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that is to consider quickly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2825.828s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the dimensional table, table of uses, because that informs when we're talking about these zones, what actually will be done and performed within them in all of these zones that we're just describing in abstract terms right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2841.043s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Paola, remind me, was this one of the materials that we sent around to the committee on Friday, or is this a later breaking document?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2854.096s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, okay, excellent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2855.757s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2857.637s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, I couldn't remember off the top of my head.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2858.838s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's been a long day, but that's great, as intended, circulated to councillors prior to the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2864.339s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'd like to ask my fellow committee members, you know, to lead off the discussion if there are any aspects of the proposed dimensionals, aspects of the table of uses that we'd like to flag for question or comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2920.765s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=2921.966s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go ahead, Professor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3134.568s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears, Director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3135.85s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, sorry, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3207.508s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3343.983s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Emily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3344.543s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3511.714s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So the suggestion would be rather than instituting a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3515.478s">[Kit Collins]</a>: rather than instituting no minimums for commercial to state a maximum ground floor height in commercial?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3547.694s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm amenable to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3548.514s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think I'm also, I understand the need to keep some industry, the possibility of industrial open, certainly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3555.217s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also, you know, see that in the context of trying to develop new zoning that will entice, you know, kind of making maximum use of this corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3566.361s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm also amenable to the kind of suggestion of one story by special permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3576.445s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But it sounds like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3580.689s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I feel like I'm hearing comfort with the concept of a minimum height of one story in commercial with that max ground floor height set at 30 feet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3682.509s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do see a hand on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3683.47s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We will take public participation soon when we finish up with this item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3687.792s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3917.678s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3920.139s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If I'm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3921.62s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One second, Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3923.04s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3941.263s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is there a second on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3942.965s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is there a second on the motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3945.167s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it's just being decided to end it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3946.568s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3946.888s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, we're just adding it to the list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3948.99s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=3949.29s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll recognize you, Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4032.869s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4033.489s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I think that there's been a lot of good kind of guiding questions floated by Councilors and city staff in this discussion that should guide us as city staff and the zoning consultant kind of more deeply consider<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4051.345s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the table of uses for MX3 and commercial so that we, you know, kind of the same questions that we have been talking about, but just getting to a more granular place as we finalize this, which is, you know, how do we make sure that our zoning makes it harder for people to do things here that we really don't want them to do, that we don't want Mystic App being used for anymore, while making it accessible for the types of uses that we really do want to be cultivating and attracting, while<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4078.294s">[Kit Collins]</a>: having a coherent enough, comfortable enough experience for people who do business along the stick out and the residents nearby.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4107.674s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Paola or Emily, has there been a co-working definition added to the table of uses or can we do that for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4177.759s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go ahead, Councilor Calderon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4381.585s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Cullohan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4387.591s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are there any further comments or questions that we want to raise for NS Associates city staff on the table of uses and definitions before we close out discussion of this topic?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4405.156s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing none, to recap, I think that- If I may?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4567.895s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Sal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4570.396s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's nice to be able to infuse these conversations about the nitty gritty and with the visioning that guides what we're trying to do here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4577.28s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you both.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4579.701s">[Kit Collins]</a>: To summarize, coming out of this meeting, we are incorporating some updates to the housing definitions around co-living, co-housing, and dormitory on the Mystic Ave zoning proposal, which is nearing completion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4597.134s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, we have some minor additional adjustments to, um, the land use map, as we discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4605.919s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, a couple specific motions were made detailing those requested changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4611.442s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, and in addition, I think we have a directive to city staff and the zoning consultant to work together, um, to, on a very granular level, consider<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4623.544s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the table of uses and dimensionals specifically around next use three commercial and how they will affect the overall character and coherence of Mystic app.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4633.409s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Unless there are any further questions or motions, I would entertain a motion to put this forward and keep the paper in committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4662.871s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I see a hand raise on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4663.972s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Gaston, I'll unmute you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4665.413s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Please go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4665.974s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Please state your name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4667.435s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4668.176s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for waiting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4748.838s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4748.998s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Gaston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4750.219s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I think that point about where we want flexibility is really relevant here and very well taken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4757.304s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4758.845s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4772.073s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, on the motion by President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4774.634s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I understand this is no longer a hybrid meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4778.356s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4779.657s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4780.478s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4782.079s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4783.479s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And thank you, city staff and associates for being with us and guiding us as usual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=4788.823s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Meeting adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1172.22s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Chair Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1176.072s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I think that this is another one of this council's big projects that it would behoove us and the community to try to set an ambitious timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1186.038s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There is so much to discuss here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1188.819s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know that there's a ton of energy around reviewing the charter in the community right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1193.922s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think that we should try to do what we can on the city council side to have the option stay open, to be putting changes to voters sooner instead of missing that window that only comes around once every several years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1207.09s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think that we should approach that, yeah, ambitiously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1209.412s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And as for kind of how to get started on that, I do think that it'd be worthwhile for us to have a meeting to kind of internally review and discuss the report before we start meeting with other stakeholders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1221.0s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I mean, I think there's a lot of reasons to do that, just because it's a lot to digest, there's a lot to discuss, it's all very consequential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1226.944s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But also, I know that in this process, we're inevitably going to try and reconcile and find consensus<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1233.666s">[Kit Collins]</a>: between perspectives that might be very different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1235.647s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'd prefer for us to kind of have some chances to get ideas from different sources out on the table before we then start having those discussions between different types of stakeholders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1245.23s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Because I think this is going to be a process where there are a lot of different ideas and different preferences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1250.692s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think it would serve us well if we approach it from a standpoint of, I'm not having a different idea from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1258.826s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you, whoever that is, in reaction to your idea or in opposition to that idea, but rather there are different approaches to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5pNSZMGM6Qk&t=1264.49s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let's get them all out on the table, and then let's consider all of our approaches and just try to choose the best path forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=407.964s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much Councilor Lazzaro, I apologize for holding up the start of this meeting I was running late and then my computer took 10 minutes to join the Wi-Fi, my apologies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=418.416s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm joining the Zoom now, so I'll be able to screen share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=422.719s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But just to recap, so the Overgrowth Ordinance was a proposal from, I believe, the previous term that was discussed with the Director of the Board of Health, as well as the Code Enforcement Officers from the Building Department, to deal with issues of accessibility on our public ways, such as sidewalk, and just to make sure that accessibility is maintained even when<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=448.716s">[Kit Collins]</a>: yards and vegetation originating on private property is perhaps a little less closely tended to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=454.06s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In a lot of cases that's totally fine, but in cases where it becomes a harborage for pests or insects or rodents or it grows so large that it affects people's ability to walk on the sidewalk, that's a problem and the city does need a mechanism to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=468.989s">[Kit Collins]</a>: step in in that case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=470.871s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And similarly, in how it affects the pest issue specifically, we were also requested to take another look at the rodent control ordinance by the Director of the Board of Health and some of the collaborators in City Administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=486.608s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As has been a topic of many many conversations in the city council over the past few years than a city staff are diligently working on every week of the year, you know the rodent population in Medford as a neighboring communities is a really big issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=499.353s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And as we see more development both from private developers and from public projects such as the MBTA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=504.515s">[Kit Collins]</a>: displacing rodent populations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=506.657s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're getting more and more complaints, and I know that the Board of Health and the Health Department has been actively seeking to, you know, not just continue what they're already doing, but to be able to do more by way of prevention and mitigation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=520.689s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And obviously, controlling the rodent pest population in Medford is something that, if we have something that's working over here and something that's not working over here, then the problem isn't really getting better, because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=532.819s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Rats can change leases a lot more easily than people can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=538.749s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've heard it said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=541.028s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So at our first meeting on this topic, we discussed these two issues broadly with the board of health director and reviewed some preliminary ideas from mainly the board of health director, as well as code enforcement officers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=555.719s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we motioned out to see an initial draft of the overgrowth ordinance, which I had the clerk circulate yesterday and have shared with city staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=565.887s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we also motioned to have some first drafts<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=571.092s">[Kit Collins]</a>: updates made to the rodent control ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=573.193s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So committee members have both of those documents before them this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=579.974s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have some feedback from city staff on these documents, and I know that Director O'Connor is also on the line as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=590.677s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I thought that tonight we could, in not too much time, we could<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=595.852s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that councilors have reviewed these documents already, most likely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=599.295s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I thought that we could quickly go over these drafts, flag any initial comments or questions that councilors do have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=607.641s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Note any comments that Director O'Connor has for how to take these forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=612.124s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that the building commissioner is also going to weigh in and then report out some planned updates or amendments to take these<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=622.881s">[Kit Collins]</a>: further into our third meeting onto this topic based on the feedback that we heard tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=628.143s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then hopefully the next time we meet on this, we can have a pretty close to finalized document on both counts, having undergone a legal review as well that we can report out expeditiously, hopefully, if it is the will of this committee, and just put these new mechanisms on the books so that our city staff can implement them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=649.949s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I would be happy to turn it over to Director O'Connor for preliminary comments, and then I can just quickly walk through both documents, unless I'd be happy to turn the floor over to any of my fellow councilors who had questions or comments that they wanted to start out with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=941.945s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=943.266s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If I may, yeah, it sounds like there's, I think there's a good argument for defining standing water as a term, much like we included a definition for bird feeder in the wildlife feeding ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=953.912s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's one of those things where if you know what it means, you don't need it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=956.673s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But if you don't, it's good to have it articulated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=982.828s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What I would recommend is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=987.287s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'd like for in this meeting for us to end with a motion to send both the overgrowth ordinance and the updates to the rodent control ordinance, incorporating any amendments or planned amendments that we talk about in this meeting, for those amendments to be incorporated by myself and for them then to be sent to legal review before our next committee meeting on the topics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1006.283s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Then when we see it again, it includes any updates that this committee would like to see, Director O'Connor or Commissioner Vandewall would like to see,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1014.229s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and has undergone legal review with those changes, and then we'll review it again and report it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1019.151s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That would be my proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1043.8s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1044.34s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'll just note, because I know we discussed a lot about the purpose and intentions of this ordinance at our first meeting, but just to quickly revisit because we're not going line by line on this, because frankly, it's pretty straightforward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1057.045s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think that we need to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1058.826s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just to summarize as briefly as I can, what this document says is essentially<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1066.474s">[Kit Collins]</a>: stating what we talked about as the goals being to give the city a mechanism to do enforcement when there is really problematic overgrowth that isn't being addressed on its own, defining the terms as needed, essentially saying overgrowth and harborage conditions that infringe on the public right of way or create nuisance conditions are prohibited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1087.332s">[Kit Collins]</a>: making a clear exception that nothing in this section shall be interpreted as to prohibit gardening, landscaping, etc.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1094.676s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that enforcement is only necessary if it is determined to be the cause of a public's safety threat or nuisance by city officials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1102.6s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It lays out who's enforcing it and penalties, and then it also does stipulate, as Director O'Connor suggested, that any penalty fines that are collected from enforcement of this ordinance will be deposited into the rodent control account to create revenue for doing rodent mitigation citywide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1121.613s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know that this draft was promulgated after the agenda for this meeting went out, so I'll make sure that the clerk can attach it to the committee report for this meeting so that the public can view it ahead of our next committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1133.858s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So with that, I would be happy to offer a motion to, I think the only thing left to do on this draft is to add in that we want a definition for standing water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1145.286s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then I will forward this along to legal review and also ask for legal input on some of the questions and highlighted parts in the draft that I sent around to Councilors, which is mostly asking for their input on how to define certain terms the right way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1264.044s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1302.559s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, if I may, I'd love to run quickly through the road and control ordinance updates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1306.7s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1309.401s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This one is a little more<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1312.543s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's equally straightforward, but it's a little more complicated because we're updating an existing ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1319.791s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I would be happy to just quickly summarize what I've added, or I could also quickly share my screen and just go through it, walk through it for our Councilors and the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1332.464s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just, I just wanna,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1335.396s">[Kit Collins]</a>: make sure that we run through it very quickly before we... I would also make a motion to incorporate any suggestions from councillors, continue to work with Director O'Connor to further tweak these updates and then submit this for legal review as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1351.089s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I defer to my councillors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1352.27s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And if we would like to see it on the screen and go through it section by section, again, very quickly, or if a summary would be sufficient.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1375.984s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1378.465s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So again, this is along many of the same goals that we have already discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1383.887s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And this is just a bit more for Councilors to read through because it is updates to the existing ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1391.871s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What I am suggesting here in incorporating some of the new goals that we've heard from Director O'Connor for this ordinance to give the health department more tools to do the enforcement that they need to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1406.08s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In adding those, I think that it would be helpful for us to do some light reorganization of the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1411.164s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So in the draft that I passed around to councilors prior to this meeting, which again, I will have the clerk attached to the committee report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1419.471s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that up until now, the ordinance has mostly been about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1424.895s">[Kit Collins]</a>: definitions and then permitting requirements for commercial properties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1430.379s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Things that they have to do to get a permit as it pertains to rodent control, such as creating an integrated pest management plan, what has to be involved in that plan, what to do if they don't follow that plan, etc.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1442.328s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A lot of what Director, or not a lot of, but some of the cornerstone of what Director O'Connor and I are trying to do in these updates is to put it all in the same ordinance, what we expect of commercial properties,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1454.838s">[Kit Collins]</a>: what we expect of residential properties and what we expect of different types of residential properties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1459.281s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm suggesting that we add in those goals that we discussed the first meeting and then reorganize the ordinance so that it kind of sets our purpose and goals up top, talks about residential properties, and then it talks about commercial properties, including all of those rules around integrated pest management plans and whatnot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1476.732s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that draft does move around the sections a little bit and I propose that we just finalize the section numbers once everything is actually solidified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1487.27s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have kind of slotted in everything that Director O'Connor and I have spoken about with goals for the updated ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1494.191s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There are some specific questions that I have on wording, language sufficiency, making sure that things are phrased in such a way that it'll be seamlessly enforceable for city officials, to make sure that things are phrased in such a way that it will be really easy for residents and property owners to understand what is expected of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1516.056s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that's the type of thing that I would just like to get another round of feedback from city staff on and also get feedback during the legal review on to make sure that this language is where it ought to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1532.067s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This ordinance also,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1537.879s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One thing, another specific thing that I'd be looking for input from legal counsel on is one goal of the health department was to have different levels of fines for noncompliance with the rodent control ordinance from residential buildings with less than three units versus residential buildings with more than three units.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1558.785s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I thought that there's kind of a fairness factor to having a heavier penalty for failure to do anything about rodent prevention and mitigation be levied upon<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1567.807s">[Kit Collins]</a>: condo buildings, apartment buildings, buildings that are run more similarly to commercial buildings, as opposed to your single families, your duplexes, your triplexes, owner-occupied buildings, which I think makes a lot of sense, but I want some guidance to make sure that we're just phrasing that the right way since ordinance fines are governed by state law and how we may allocate those fines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1592.958s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm just calling that as a specific question that we put into legal counsel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1602.364s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just running through to see if there's anything else major that I want to make sure that Councilors are aware of in this draft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1612.048s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I don't believe that there are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1612.909s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think I have several more nitty gritty language questions that I'd like to forward along to legal counsel, which were included in the markup version that was circulated to Councilors, and that will be attached to the committee report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1624.2s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But apart from that, the other major change in this ordinance is that it specifically, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1630.306s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It doubles down on the language for designating the rodent control account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1634.568s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And this newly states that integrated pest management permit fees will be deposited into the rodent control account, which is new as of these updates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1647.255s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think those are the major points that I wanted to flag, the most substantial points that I wanted to flag from the update, but I defer to Director O'Connor if there's anything that we've missed or anything that she'd like to add or underline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1779.003s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What section was that, Director O'Connor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1800.763s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1804.186s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1857.476s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Director O'Connor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1859.498s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I would just note one thing I neglected to mention that was also sent around to councillors is the fee schedule that describes<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1872.381s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that the fees attached to integrated pest management, fees for rodent control issues that are attached to street openings are referenced in this ordinance, but those are governed by Appendix A, which is our fee schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1886.952s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So there are also proposed updates to that, which I will finalize, run by legal counsel, and attach to the updated version of this ordinance that comes before this committee at our next meeting date on this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1903.407s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you so much for those comments, and I'd be, if there aren't any other comments or questions from councilors, I would make a motion to continue to incorporate feedback from Director O'Connor, run relevant sections of this update by the Commissioner of Public Works, Building Commissioner, run the section on composting by Director Hunt,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1929.696s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and then get a legal review of the document, and also get some input from city staff on the updated fee schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1939.278s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then when all of those documents are complete, keep this in committee and meet again after the legal review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1958.137s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, legal or just professional insight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1961.579s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1963.119s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As with the rest of our updating of the fee schedule across various departments, just want to make sure that we're in line with what other communities are doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=2004.451s">[Kit Collins]</a>: How about until legal review and all department review is complete?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=2087.626s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to keep the papers in committee and adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=117.115s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=958.59s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you to President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=959.811s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for being with us today to give us some context on this item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=966.356s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As has been discussed, it's always sobering to hear of having to potentially put on the table a little bit more than we initially thought would have to be budgeted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=975.342s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, unfortunately, we're in a fiscal environment where that is happening across the board because the cost of all sorts of infrastructural tools, materials and services are more expensive than they've been.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=986.388s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, when these estimates were made several years in the past due to inflation and other factors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=990.35s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that this is one of those scenarios where, you know, it never feels great to have to spend more than we had initially forecast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=998.214s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But this is still a non-negotiable and I think it is well worth<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1003.317s">[Kit Collins]</a>: spending a little bit more to make sure that what we are investing in is more resilient for the future when we know these systems will, you know, have to be maintained, have to be upgraded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1013.226s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And if we're going to be putting money on the table at all, I'd rather it be getting us closer to our climate goals and be a part of a new, more resilient system for our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1021.494s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You already covered the questions that I had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1022.775s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1024.016s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I would be happy to motion to approve this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1107.44s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, do you have any more specifics about like which which roadways are going to be worked on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2334.687s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2335.988s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Appreciate this discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2339.032s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate this discussion also being put in the context of the other budgeting tools that the Council goes through throughout the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2346.965s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It seems to me that the questions of negotiations are ones that the administration forecasts and creates its container for during the annual budgeting process, which we of course went through this past June and will again for FY26 starting next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2361.912s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I also just want to remind the Council that the appropriations before us are from the capital, the capital stabilization fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2370.356s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So the money requests, the appropriation requests that are before us are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2375.416s">[Kit Collins]</a>: limited to appropriation for capital spending purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2378.417s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And they are very limited in that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2382.298s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These are not dollars that could be used for any purpose at all in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2385.999s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They are limited to capital expenditures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2389.28s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that is why we are considering infrastructural and maintenance projects before us this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2395.922s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2638.274s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=353.151s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you president bears at this meeting of the planning and permitting committee as usual we are meeting with our zoning consultant this time it was to go over proposals for new zoning for the mystic Avenue quarter that are approaching a level of finalization those will be in the committee at least one more time before they are voted out and go to the community development board and then the city council for more discussion motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1109.684s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears appreciate the Councilor for bringing this forward and for the discussion so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1117.95s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Very happy to see the council taking this issue up this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1121.452s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it is very important that we do publicly appreciate and acknowledge Tufts University when it does things that are positive for our community and, you know, show that partnership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1136.203s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think it's just as important for us to take note when it is missing opportunities to invest in our public sector.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1144.549s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In the way that is in the spirit of the payment in lieu of tax relationship that we do have with the university I think that this is an important thing for us to advocate around specifically because it is not a part of our pilot agreement and we know that you know the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1160.748s">[Kit Collins]</a>: kind of the point of the pilot agreement is that it is not equivalent to what Tufts would be investing in Medford if Tufts was a regular property taxpayer, like every other property taxpayer in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1174.516s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's significant that this is one of, through this Neighborhood Fellows program, I think this is a really important program to call out because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1184.162s">[Kit Collins]</a>: what it does in an intangible way is it empowers people in communities, including Medford and like Medford around the greater Boston area, to become people who can be more and more effective at investing and managing and developing public sectors and being changemakers in the public sector.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1204.128s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so I think it's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1206.906s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's been meaningful in the past that Tufts has chosen to extend this into our communities, and especially because Tufts and other tax-exempt nonprofits like it do not have to invest in a public sector the way that everybody else does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1223.657s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I hope that we can take them at their word when they say that they are trying to bring this back expeditiously, but that's not something that we have to take them at their word.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1232.943s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we need to advocate for it, and I hope that we can see this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1236.769s">[Kit Collins]</a>: program returned to its full strength very quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1240.911s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And while we remain in discussion with them around that, just to add our voice to the chorus to say we can see how meaningful this has been for students that come from Medford and our neighboring communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1253.315s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it's an important piece of that puzzle when it comes to making the city whole for all of the benefits that Tufts and other tax exempt nonprofits receive from being in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1264.94s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3087.472s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3088.733s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'd like to thank the Councilor for putting this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3091.556s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'd be happy to second the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3093.838s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that when it comes to being an informed voter, you know, that's just the most important thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3100.524s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And of course, as has been discussed, we have to be, you know, when we're talking about all these forums, we have to make, we have to remember that we have to treat this the same way that we would<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3111.411s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If a candidate was running their own campaign, we have to be really careful about not using city resources to be for one side or the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3121.146s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's why I do my campaigning on this issue outside of City Hall, even though everybody knows my position on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3127.932s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think that it is extremely valuable to use our platform to hold a Q&A session, because when it comes to this issue, there are no bad questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3138.978s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've had some great conversations with people over the past few months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3141.839s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I remember one person said to me, let me get this straight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3144.701s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If this were to pass, my property taxes would go up by 2.5%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3148.202s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I was like, I'm so glad you asked, because that's not the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3153.485s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think it's really important that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3155.768s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We work within the parameters that we have to have those conversations to make a space for those conversations, whether it's with our senior citizens to talk about this process, the potential impacts to talk about the many exemption programs that were maxed out on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3171.028s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and to invite all other parts of our constituencies, people who are hungry for that information so that everybody can go into the polling booths, feeling as informed as they want to be and really confident to cast their vote one way or the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3184.539s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'll second the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3185.86s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5322.403s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5323.004s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, my audio cut out and I couldn't hear the clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=174.244s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There will be a meeting of the Planning and Permanent Committee on September 25, 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=178.185s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This meeting will take place at 6 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=180.766s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in the City Council Chamber, second floor, Medford City Hall, and via Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=185.627s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=203.949s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's not him, so he's... Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=207.37s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Four present, one absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=208.55s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This meeting is called to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=210.771s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The action discussion item for this meeting is, again, paper 24033, Zoning Ordinance Updates with the NS Associates Team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=221.614s">[Kit Collins]</a>: At this meeting, we will be discussing a proposal for zoning along Mystic Avenue Corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=230.595s">[Kit Collins]</a>: which has been robustly discussed by this committee in various planning stages over the past several months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=237.498s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So tonight we're looking at a set of documents that are more baked than they have been over the past few weeks of workshopping this in committee with our zoning consultant, NS Associates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=248.622s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Before we get started, I just want to set the table for this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=254.864s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're getting a bit of a late start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=256.665s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I apologize for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=257.845s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Had some delay getting everybody here and online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=261.609s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are just gonna I think we should try to keep this to about if we can try and wrap by 8 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=267.434s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=268.275s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that that's we have plenty to Discuss but I think that we have some clear decision points this evening So I'm really confident that we can get through this in an hour and a half maybe even earlier because Councilors have had all weekend to review the documents that we're looking at before us tonight with some only some minor changes and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=285.918s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also want to note that it is our norm to have public participation at the end of committee meetings, so stick with us and we'll be sure to hear from everybody, whether you're here in the chambers with us or on Zoom, after the discussion between Councilors, staff, and the zoning consultant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=304.069s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Before I hand it over to Paola from Innes Associates to give us a presentation of what we're looking at tonight, I just want to say that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=312.628s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Over the past several meetings the discussion of mystic corridor has been really central what we've talked about in this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=319.171s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're kind of in a way splitting our work in rezoning between these kind of quarter by quarter approaches and global strategies for the whole city mystic has been a priority from the Council from the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=333.055s">[Kit Collins]</a>: from staff, we know that we need to really make tracks to rezone this so that we get what we want on Mystic and not just what happens to be there by right now, that developers can utilize or take advantage of that might not reflect what residents currently want to see on Mystic and from Mystic and may not be giving the community all the benefits that we deserve and that we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=360.074s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think that our main decision points that Paola is going to speak to are around doling up the land use for various parts of Mystic, particularly on the west side, where we have kind of a menu of options for how to deal with the zoning on the west side of Mystic, proposed included parcels, a question of setbacks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=383.199s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But beyond that, the documents that we're about to look at are the product of these many meetings of talking about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=388.68s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What do we know that we want from Mystic Ave?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=390.541s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What do our many studies and plans and community sessions over the past several years tell us that the community wants from Mystic Ave?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=397.084s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So all of that feeds into the documents and the questions that we're looking at tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=401.467s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And, you know, from the chair, I'll say that my goal is for the end of the meeting tonight for us to be able to make some motions to give Innes Associates some really clear marching orders for how we wanna go forward so that two committee meetings from now on October 23rd,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=418.433s">[Kit Collins]</a>: we can see a finalized proposal of this corridor zoning back and report it out of committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=424.697s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But we'll have to make, we'll have to have a discussion tonight around those main decision points so that by the end of the evening, we can say, all right, this, this and that, we're gonna say yes on this, no on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=435.025s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Here's what we want, please package it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=436.926s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let's look at it one more time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=440.228s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And let's get this moving onto the Community Development Board and the procedural steps after that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=445.372s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, with that table set,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=448.826s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One minute?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=450.027s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh yeah, I'd be happy to turn it over to Director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=1245.521s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's okay, we'll get you back up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=1273.421s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's okay, let's take a beat and we're gonna get Paola's presentation back up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=1279.545s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll take a question from Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=1282.739s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think Paola probably won't be able to respond for a couple moments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=1289.625s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I think, yeah, I just want to give her a second to figure out her computer trouble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=1293.248s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=1473.581s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have a quick question on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=1475.938s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The incentive zoning that you just outlined, would that be for both land use option A and option B?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=1481.621s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It could be, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=1482.442s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=1483.022s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just want to clarify that's not specific to option B. Yeah, exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=1518.114s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you, Pella.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=1519.115s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll go to questions and comments from councillors, and then I'm really eager to hear our planning staff's perspective on this comparison and this menu of options as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=1527.2s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=1765.504s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2286.531s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2286.851s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think I saw a hand from Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2812.892s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2813.172s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2813.492s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think we will be diving into incentive zoning more deeply at our next committee meeting as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2818.536s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So go for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2975.669s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2976.029s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll just a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2976.99s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Hill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2977.39s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2978.151s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just to jump in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2978.792s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm glad you just spoke to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2980.213s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That was a question that I had on, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2985.365s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the mixed use lens uses in particular is like where those would include life science or research specifically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2996.19s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think that would be a great thing to get more specific on for our next committee meeting, or even if we could kind of have an update on that in two weeks, just so we can kind of understand, you know, I think it's especially when I look at mixed use three in either option A or B, I could certainly see it kind of on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=3013.086s">[Kit Collins]</a>: more northern side of Mystic, and I'm curious to get a little more specific on where we could see that, where we could see developers opting into that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=3022.953s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'll hold my further two cents for, I'll go to, Paula, do you have a quick response or, okay, then we'll go to Councilor Callaghan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=3083.134s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Pella.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=3083.754s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And yeah, I think that is kind of one of our three critical decisions, or two or three critical decisions for tonight is, do we have mixed use four north of Mystic, or are we leaving that to mixed use three?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=3097.296s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I do think part of my question on that, I like the ideas that have been posed so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=3101.397s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I certainly, I think that considering mixed use one for that area along Hicks, close to the park, the school, the housing, makes a lot of sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=3112.694s">[Kit Collins]</a>: kind of for the same motivations that we're putting Mixed Use 1 at the west end of Mystic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=3117.476s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that putting Mixed Use 1 close to that, it's kind of a hub there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=3121.237s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's close to where a lot of streets join.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=3122.997s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are starting to see some really nice ground floor commercial up at that joining.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=3128.719s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think that for a lot of reasons, changing that little elbow to Mixed Use 1 could improve either option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=3138.342s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'd personally like to know a little bit more about how<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=3141.624s">[Kit Collins]</a>: life science and research could figure into mixed use three or the north side of Mystic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=3146.926s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In either case, I'll go to Councilor Callahan and then President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=3192.063s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And if I could just jump in here before I hand it over to President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=3195.629s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In my understanding, like the way that these options unamended are presented to us right now, we could still like mixed use four, whether it's on both sides of Mystic or just one, developers could opt in to put life science and research there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=3208.695s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's just a question of, are we creating that kind of like natural environment on just the South side or on the North side as well?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=3216.698s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If it's the case that mixed use three is not exactly telegraphing life science to developers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=3473.511s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=3473.852s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=3474.272s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So there's, I think, to add to the things on the table, there's a suggestion for this more streamlined way of defining<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=3484.062s">[Kit Collins]</a>: maximum height to allow for that flexibility, especially in, which maybe would most come into play in mixed use four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=3999.721s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, so I really appreciate that and I think that was I think that was really well said and echoes you know kind of a lot of our goals with how to make sure that we are enticing the development that we really want and need to be seeing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4011.82s">[Kit Collins]</a>: here specifically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4012.74s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that general point of discussion is a really important one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4018.803s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For me, it further endears me to option B because I think it's extremely worth considering how much kind of zoned for commercial, telegraphing commercial is enough or too much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4033.469s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And this is already kind of further cordoning off that commercial specific to just the south side of Mystic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4038.811s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I wouldn't be a proponent necessarily of having<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4042.051s">[Kit Collins]</a>: no commercial zoning necessarily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4044.112s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think that we need to go that far, but I feel comfortable, especially if we're, you know, amending this proposal such that it's kind of more clear where life science fits in and making it more flexible to include life science and research, putting that commercial zone how it currently is in option B, but with the carve out for perhaps<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4069.301s">[Kit Collins]</a>: mixed-use one along the park school housing area along Hicks Avenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4079.288s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In terms of what we have, just to quickly gloss over, not comprehensively, what we've spoken about so far and some of the ideas that have been put on the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4090.752s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4092.974s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We know that we want to see this amended to include a definition of life sciences in the use table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4097.958s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we want to see that alternate way of defining maximum height for mixed-use 3 and commercial to allow that flexibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4107.666s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It sounds like there's a lot of interest in seeing that carve out for mixed-use 1 along HCSAV and commercial like we were just talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4117.682s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then I think we're going to come back to President Bears' suggestion about potentially, for the purposes of this proposal, just moving forward the highlighted parcels within the potential parcels for inclusion around Harvard, Alexander, and Bonner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4133.517s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just to, yeah, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4138.503s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4139.424s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just to, I just want to recenter us on kind of the questions that we need to make sure we answer tonight to move this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4145.307s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It sounds like we're approaching consensus on what we want to motion out as next steps for our zoning consultant in terms of land uses and proposed added parcels that we haven't taken motions on any of that yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4157.114s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We haven't spoken as much about, we've touched on the setbacks issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4160.476s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We haven't spoken as much about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4161.796s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I want to make sure if there's a discussion to be had about how we handle that issue, I want to make sure we spend some time on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4170.865s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4457.281s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Would it be possible for you to screen share that, Paola, the table of uses?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4610.845s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4613.186s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, those of us behind the rail, myself included, struggled to find that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4628.484s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think I just want to get, with this, I just want to get clarity on if we should be taking care in the finalized proposal to be seeing life science included in the table of definitions and also added as allowed uses to mixed use three and four, or if it's already... Right now, manufacturing and research and testing are no, no, no, yes, or special permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4784.027s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4786.988s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4788.229s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, it sounds like we're getting close to being able to make some motions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4794.012s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think the setbacks issue can we can we skim over that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4796.893s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It sounds like that's pretty close to dispensed with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4799.354s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are there questions from Councilors on how to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4802.886s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Or Pella, is there a similar kind of like options that you're presenting to us when it comes to the treatment of setbacks in the various land uses along Mystic or?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4846.411s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, I might have misphrased my question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4848.433s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was talking about setbacks specifically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4886.894s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I think we can do that really quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4888.436s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Can we skim through the issue of the presentation on the setbacks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4910.699s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I think, I think, since the presentation was circulated ahead of time, if it's possible, Paola, to just kind of give us the comparison on what's, what's the difference between the two options for property owners, what's the difference in streetscape, and what is your recommendation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5453.49s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5454.411s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Can I jump in here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5455.191s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5456.172s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think I keep missing the second half of each of these options that we're setting up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5463.256s">[Kit Collins]</a>: With option A, is it the case that we have this 15 feet of curb and then we also get<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5472.039s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Do we have 15 feet of sidewalk in any case under this proposal, and then we maybe get three feet more depending on the negotiation with the property owner?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5481.693s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm confused about what the difference is between these two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5483.756s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Could you make it even simpler than you're already doing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5506.377s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is the difference in what we are asking of the property owners and how that setback curb zone is designated, like this is your building setback versus<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5515.097s">[Kit Collins]</a>: this is your property but you're designating it as an active pedestrian zone and just like how we're referring to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5551.813s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5552.233s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I mean, if option A is more, it sounds like you think it'd be more streamlined, which I'm always<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5560.742s">[Kit Collins]</a>: persuaded by.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5569.504s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are there further questions or comments from councillors on these kind of, it strikes me that the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5581.479s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The resident experience for people walking down the sidewalk will not be much changed from option A versus option B. As one Councilor, I'd be comfortable with moving forward with trying to see if we can make option A happen pending Paula's future research.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5598.45s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then we can, you know, over the next, I guess that'd be two or three weeks, and then see what's possible for the final package on the 23rd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5606.976s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are there additional questions or comments on this from Councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5609.978s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Or do we feel comfortable with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5611.957s">[Kit Collins]</a>: putting that pin in it, seeing some thumbs up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5615.439s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you for that explanation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5620.162s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we have some resolution on the question of setbacks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5625.865s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know President Bearss is working on a motion on land use, and then it sounded like there wasn't a lot of quarrel with the idea of for the proposal coming to us in a month, including just the highlighted parcels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5639.474s">[Kit Collins]</a>: inside those proposed additional parcels being added to the Mystic Ave corridor area, which satisfies my list of three questions that we absolutely had to speak to tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5651.863s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Paola, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5719.401s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5720.602s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5726.046s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you for that substantive overview of a lot of what's before us for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5729.878s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in the Stick Up corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5730.818s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is really exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5731.679s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know there were some motions in the works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5734.36s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I can't make motions from the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5738.562s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any further questions, comments from councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5742.264s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm also happy to go to public participation while folks are thinking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5745.625s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Could you do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5746.626s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then I'll do the motions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5747.886s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5752.008s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll open it up for public participation on this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5756.03s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If you're in person, you may approach the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5758.683s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I will recognize you if you're on Zoom, please click the raise hand button and I will recognize and unmute you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5766.386s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For public participation, everyone who wishes to speak has three minutes to speak their mind on this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5775.15s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Not seeing any hands raised, I'll give it a second for folks to find the button if they're looking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5785.314s">[Kit Collins]</a>: While I'm vamping, I'll just note that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5788.01s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As Paola mentioned at the beginning of the meeting, our planned agenda for our next committee meeting, which is October 8th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5799.9s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So Innes Associates will be working on finalizing what comes out of this meeting into a final proposal for us to review on Mystic App Corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5808.547s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So at our next meeting on October 9th, I think our plan is again to revisit the topic of green score.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5816.431s">[Kit Collins]</a>: which we touched on, I think it was two meetings ago now, or maybe just one, as well as our housing definitions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5823.294s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I will make sure that all the documents that this committee received or looked at in committee around those two topics are recirculated to Councilors ahead of time so that we can come in ready to make some decisions and ask some really good questions around green score and housing and get those<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5841.881s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Moving along as well, so that green score, the housing definitions, and the Mystic Avenue zoning proposal can all be reported out as a package on October 23rd, if we should move that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5858.793s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I misspoke, it's just October 9th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5867.018s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Green score and- And housing definitions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5871.744s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we are hoping to have a finalized proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5873.985s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are planning to have a finalized green score proposal to potentially report out on October 23 at the same time as Mystic Avenue zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5883.25s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5976.203s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=5977.705s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I see a second from Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=6005.146s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=6007.427s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=6007.807s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=6008.687s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=6008.927s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for the clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=6010.288s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=6010.488s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that's a second from Councilor Callahan on President Bears' motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=6017.126s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're not hybrid tonight, so unless anyone requests a roll call vote, all those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=6022.369s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=6023.769s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=6027.011s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=6027.351s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well, I'm really excited to leave this meeting with a clear set of next steps on zoning for the Mystic Ave corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=6036.116s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Really excited to review that final proposal ahead of our committee meeting on the 23rd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=6040.578s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Really excited to move forward<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=6043.018s">[Kit Collins]</a>: a more specific plan for green score as well as shoring up our housing definitions on October 9th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=6048.962s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Like I said, I'll make sure that all of our documents around green score and housing definitions are forwarded to Councilors ahead of time so we can review and come prepared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=6055.927s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just want to thank Paola and Jimmy from Innes Associates so much for your hard work in helping us get to this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=6062.372s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is the culmination of not just nine months of work on zoning in this committee, but also incorporating many, many years of community outreach and planning as a community-wide process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=6072.605s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for going through that with us, and thank you, of course, Director Hunt and Planner Evans for shepherding us through this work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=6081.169s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any final comments from councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=6083.591s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Do I have a motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=6086.812s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to adjourn, seconded by Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=6088.513s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=6090.474s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=6091.595s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=405.543s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=406.723s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Ken, just want to thank you so much for once again coming before the council to, you know, for folks who don't already know some of that history and context about the Chevalier, and for folks who know a little bit, maybe know it as an event venue, but haven't interfaced with what a community center it is and how much good it provides, not just as an entertainment center in Medford Square, but as a historic piece of property that's utilized by so many types of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=432.153s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in our community with our neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=433.794s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's always great to shine a spotlight on that, and thank you so much for your work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=856.1s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears, Councilor Tseng, thank you so much for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=859.461s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As time goes on, it seems to me, I notice in lots of ways how much easier it is to be destructive than it is to be constructive or to do good or proactive things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=877.745s">[Kit Collins]</a>: case in point, you know, we have this hateful, divisive, self-serving, disgusting language, especially when it's propagated by national figures, that can very rapidly escalate to real harm against real people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=893.911s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is much easier to say something horrible to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=901.894s">[Kit Collins]</a>: trump up feelings in your base to achieve some kind of political ends than it is to use words to cultivate a society where people really are welcomed, really are supported, really are brought together, so easy to be divisive, so hard to cultivate genuine and true inclusivity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=922.293s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think we see that in lots of ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=924.555s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But all that being said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=925.996s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it is still really important for bodies such as ours to try to counter that negative, hateful rhetoric with positive rhetoric whenever we can at every opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=937.409s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Often it's in reaction to something that should never have been spoken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=941.373s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I thank you for the opportunity for us to affirm as a city council, one,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=946.599s">[Kit Collins]</a>: unequivocally condemning this incident that happened in Ohio and the harm that was caused and those who sought to enrich themselves politically because of it and to stand with people who are affected by that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=960.791s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And also to affirm here in Medford, whether you were born here or not born here or not born in this country, you're part of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=969.318s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're so glad you're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=971.96s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let's stay together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=973.081s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=974.342s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for the opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1443.868s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1445.128s">[Kit Collins]</a>: At the Planning and Permitting Committee meeting last week, the topic that we discussed with our zoning consultant was green score and incentive zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1454.732s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This was kind of a preliminary discussion on both of those topics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1457.673s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so we will be meeting about them again before we take any votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1462.815s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1474.682s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1938.493s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1939.234s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for appearing before us today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1940.775s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I definitely appreciate, you know, the spirit of compromise with the amended proposal that you put forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1947.401s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that, you know, Councilor Scarponi brings up, you know, one of the most important things before this council, which is just making sure that the special permits that we extend are consistent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1955.208s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate the research that you and your company did to see what other<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1960.513s">[Kit Collins]</a>: what special permits have been granted to other restaurants to kind of keep in line with those norms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1968.399s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I personally, I think that I would be willing to approve this tonight and perhaps attach a 30, 60 and 90 day review to it so that we could continue to keep in contact with city partners and local residents and as you say, you know, collaborate to if there are issues arise because of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1985.05s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Midnight closing Monday through Thursday and 1 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1987.952s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Closing Friday Saturday Sunday We can return and adjust that at those intervals But before putting forward a motion, I'd be happy to hear opinions from my fellow councillors Thank You Vice President Collins, Councilor Leming<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2323.639s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2324.54s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I definitely appreciate the discussion around this and completely respect my councilors' various perspectives on the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2331.924s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would motion to approve the amended petition pending the public comment period and with the 30, 60, and 90-day review attached.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2726.653s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2727.874s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think anything that the city can do to make it easier for residents and visitors to enjoy our public spaces, we should at least look into doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2735.2s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Totally hear Councilor Tseng when he says, you know, nobody's under the impression that this is something we could roll out in six months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2741.885s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Of course not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2742.585s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But, you know, all the more reason to start the conversation in partnership with city partners to see, you know, what can we learn from our neighboring communities that are rolling out this kind of program more and more so that we can, you know, kind of keep up with our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2755.615s">[Kit Collins]</a>: with our regional neighbors and being able to offer that to people in our public spaces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3281.797s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3283.538s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Appreciate you being with us today, Director Blake, and for communicating about this ahead of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3287.879s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My only major question going into this appropriation request was essentially why this, why no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3293.942s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's been laid out very clearly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3297.304s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3298.484s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is an example of one of the reasons that I'm so glad that this council in partnership with the administration was able to finally set up a capital stabilization fund this year because this, it seems to me from the description given safety really is substandard at this location it's really important that we take an opportunity to bring it up to par and so important that we have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3319.635s">[Kit Collins]</a>: funds to pay for those improvements that we can actually access, which is not the case with a free cash balance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3326.817s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We wouldn't be able to access it to leverage it for this project, and safety would go on being compromised or substandard at this location, and that's just not what our residents of this city deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3340.161s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I am very excited to take our first couple of votes this evening on, I think, what are very worthy capital stabilization fund appropriation requests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=3348.784s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4064.278s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4065.159s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you to my fellow colleagues for a substantive conversation around this paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4070.723s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanna recenter that we are talking about capital stabilization fund appropriation requests and not an override and not about financial mismanagement of which there's been no evidence in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4084.893s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would motion to approve the papers before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4391.001s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for the context and kind of speaking to how this is grounded in not just decommissioning a vehicle that's been in heavy rotation for such a long time, but bringing us closer to our local climate goals and keeping in line with the state climate goals as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4409.236s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Of course, we want to be keeping up with our municipal neighbors and doing our part as a municipality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4414.92s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This seems, as you outlined, there's no other funding for this, and this is something that we need, and something that we need, I think, in terms of municipal timelines fairly urgently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4425.027s">[Kit Collins]</a>: With that in mind, I think this vote to me is unambiguous, and I would actually like to make a motion to reconsider the previous vote to sever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4432.492s">[Kit Collins]</a>: To me, these are both slam dunk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4433.793s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we should consider them at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4436.795s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that's a motion to reconsider.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4438.576s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4580.164s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=4602.179s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I will restate my motion to approve both of the appropriation requests before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2.89s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have some ideas and suggestions in just a little bit more context that I'm ready to share, but I do want to just pause and invite through the Chair, Director O'Connor to speak first because her department is so intimately involved in both all the work that they're already doing all the time to try and respond to COVID-19<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=24.997s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the pest issues that arise from overgrowth and also just the public access issues that arrive from overgrowth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=29.579s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then of course, how this dovetails with the rodent mitigation issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=32.281s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm happy to pause there and I can pick it back up with sort of more perspective, more context on this and some specific proposals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=313.37s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=314.191s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for that overview, Director O'Connor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=317.454s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=318.235s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Appreciate the work that you and your team are doing all the time on rodent mitigation efforts in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=325.762s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Super important now more than ever, it seems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=329.826s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I want to just to kind of orient us with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=333.989s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What we're looking to do here may be helpful if I just kind of step back to that kind of 30,000 foot view to talk about kind of the multiple, again, just touch on all the multiple motivations for the Overgrowth Ordinance, and then walk through some of the suggestions that I've heard from Director O'Connor and the administration about amendments to the Road and Control Ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=356.94s">[Kit Collins]</a>: with an eye towards kind of having this be a conversation, an initial conversation where we can try to flesh out that list of what needs to be introduced in the new ordinance, make sure we have everything on paper of what ought to be added to the rodent control ordinance, and just figure out what are those items that need to be drafted?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=374.673s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What are those questions that need to be answered?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=377.615s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And indeed, if there's an amendment that should be added to, for example, the wildlife feeding ordinance, to make sure that that goes into this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=383.779s">[Kit Collins]</a>: account as well that we kind of have our punch list of legislative additions or tweaks to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=390.542s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So if it's all right with you as chair, I'll just start and run through that list quickly, starting with the overgrowth ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=399.306s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And again, just to kind of set the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=403.294s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I started hearing about the need for an overgrowth ordinance a year or two ago, and actually when it first kind of came across my desk, it wasn't really related to the rodent problem specifically, but rather that people were noticing spots in the neighborhood where certain properties, neglected properties, perhaps with out-of-town property owners, where vegetation was growing,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=427.381s">[Kit Collins]</a>: so abundantly that it was actually blocking the public right away, it was blocking the sidewalk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=432.383s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it's my understanding that the building department code enforcement lacks sufficient language in our code of ordinances to actually be empowered to enforce around that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=442.468s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For me, even just the public access issue is kind of sufficient.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=446.93s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that this is one of those areas where if it's not a problem, it's not a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=452.512s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But if a sidewalk is being blocked and somebody can't walk there or push a stroller there or roll their wheelchair there, the city needs to be empowered to intervene.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=464.019s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then of course, as Director O'Connor mentioned, this dovetails with the rodent control issue and that a lot of these overgrown areas also make it really hard to keep the lid on the rodent population.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=474.926s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think it's kind of important to just keep observing that when it comes to rodent mitigation,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=481.701s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have to do a better job overall citywide because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=488.325s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, none of our lovely wildlife that we have in the city observe, you know, boundaries between public property and private properties and different lots like we do as humans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=497.848s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we need to be doing a better job of making sure that if there's a problem on private property, on commercial property, that is really causing for neighbors or that is really undermining citywide effects to keep the rodent population in check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=510.072s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We just need reasonable tools to be able to enforce around that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=584.812s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=585.633s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's a really thanks for asking sort of like the important preliminary question of why is this an issue to begin with?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=592.376s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll defer to Director O'Connor to give a more intelligent answer on like, why is this an issue in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=601.089s">[Kit Collins]</a>: why is this an issue in the city when it's not an issue in the fells, like to put it simply.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=605.333s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But in terms of the scope of the overgrowth ordinance, I would want to, I think this is one of the kind of scope issues that I'd want to drill down on in committee and with legal counsel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=616.624s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But in my impression, kind of our scope here would be to have this be dealing with issues on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=625.404s">[Kit Collins]</a>: private property inclusive of residential and commercial that are either causing public health hazards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=632.086s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This pertains to kind of our list of nuisances that are currently in the city ordinances or that are blocking public right of way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=638.388s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that's where the distinction between nobody's gonna be enforcing an overgrowth ordinance in like conserved land on the fells.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=646.371s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's an issue of making sure that if there's a plant originating on private property, that's impeding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=653.203s">[Kit Collins]</a>: public property where we all have a right to be able to access, that's the issue we need to be able to deal with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=706.573s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=707.053s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And before I pass it over to Director O'Connor, just to shore up that point, when I spoke to code enforcement about this last year, they shared that Summerville has template language that we might look to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=718.121s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just for example, their overgrowth ordinance or their analog for it says, no person in control of any property abutting a sidewalk or public right of way shall allow to remain uncut or any overgrowth of grass, shrubs, weeds, et cetera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=734.292s">[Kit Collins]</a>: growing in or around such sidewalk or public right-of-way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=736.893s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this is really just about making sure that what originates on private property does not trammel on public property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=743.775s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It has nothing to do with landscaping or the visual appeal or cutting branches up in the fells or anything like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=846.119s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, no, thank you for doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=850.06s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think that to me, I think the kind of the scope and intent of an overgrowth ordinance feels pretty clear to me from conversations with partners and city staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=861.504s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In terms of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=863.251s">[Kit Collins]</a>: next steps of putting pen to paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=864.873s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it makes sense for this council to look at language that's been adopted by our neighboring municipalities that are, of course, you know, reacting to all the same issues, whether it's maintaining access on public property and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=880.132s">[Kit Collins]</a>: mitigating rodent populations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=884.518s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In a review of Somerville's ordinance that touches on this, which is their section 9-56, it essentially says what we went over before, which is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=895.931s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You're not allowed to have overgrowth on your private property be impeding upon the public right of way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=905.279s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If you own a property that has vegetation in such a way that it is a harborage for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=911.764s">[Kit Collins]</a>: animals in such a way that could become a public health hazard like, and this doesn't necessarily mean to be need to mean rats, but for example, if you have large pools of standing water, that might be something that the Board of Health would want the ability to look into, especially this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=927.039s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's just an example, but I'm just thinking of other relevant, relevant nuisances bordering on public health hazards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=937.116s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Essentially, it's covering all of these ways that there could be circumstances on private property in which the Board of Health would want to intervene because it's posing a nuisance or potential health hazard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=947.824s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If there are any violations, then, you know, fines can occur and those fines go into a specific fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=954.329s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think that that is a pretty straightforward template that we can use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=960.071s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that a next step for this council would be to draft an initial version of said ordinance with everything that we typically see in our ordinances, definitions, scope and intent, running through that list of if thens, here's whys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=976.655s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The enforcing body, and I would wanna make sure that we're having a discussion with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=981.82s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Director O'Connor about what other partners in City Hall should be involved, if any, for example, code enforcement or DPW, because this does involve the public way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=993.186s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then just to make sure that we're really specific on that language about enforcement, fines, and the rodent control fund that Director O'Connor has suggested that any fees and fines go into.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1009.338s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'd be happy to propose a motion that as sponsor of the paper I, you know, review neighboring municipalities ordinances to create this first draft of the overgrowth ordinance in collaboration with Director O'Connor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1024.03s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Once this committee has had, you know, our full conversation on and consensus on what the scope of that should be, but I would be happy to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1033.041s">[Kit Collins]</a>: if such a motion were passed, I'd be happy to take that on so that at our next meeting on this topic, the committee could consider a first draft and kind of iterate from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1230.894s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1231.274s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, before I put forth the motion, um, Director O'Connor, I didn't catch the specific name of the fund that we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1237.317s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Would you mind repeating that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1238.217s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is that the rodent control fund?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1272.952s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1273.292s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanted to make sure I found the precise term, if needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1318.246s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1319.766s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1322.677s">[Kit Collins]</a>: committee being willing to take up both topics at the same time, I think that there, as Director O'Connor and others in city administration have noted, they're so related that I really, I think I appreciate the opportunity to consider them both at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1341.254s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On the rodent control ordinance, so that already exists, that is, let me pull it up,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1355.171s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's article five is our rodent control ordinance and our stuff on Unicode.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1361.933s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And essentially the goals here and updating it as I understand it is to work with the health department and code enforcement, perhaps DPW on amendments that will<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1374.451s">[Kit Collins]</a>: enforcement so that we can improve those outcomes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1377.372s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that there, it seems like there are some kind of essentially holes in the ordinance like Director O'Connor mentioned, expanding this to include, touch a little bit more on private properties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1389.257s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Again, I think when it comes to rodent control, it strikes me as kind of a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1396.312s">[Kit Collins]</a>: of that like Swiss cheese method of problem solving where we need to layer things on top of each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1401.594s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And if enforcement on residential areas is missing from our current ordinance and that undermines what we're trying to do in more business areas, commercial areas, development areas, etc.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1417.355s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And in addition, those updates to make sure that the fines as much as possible finds collected for violations of the ordinance are going back into this fund that gives the city more capacity to do those reactions and preventative measures that will hopefully make us a.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1435.197s">[Kit Collins]</a>: more rat-free community in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1439.018s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So, Director O'Connor, you mentioned before that kind of list of amendments that you had suggested to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1445.94s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have those before me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1446.941s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'd like to invite you to run through them if you'd like to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1449.301s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I can also just kind of quickly run through them, and then you can chime in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1455.223s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Up to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1457.444s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Vice President, go for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1459.545s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1462.385s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1470.939s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So first, to touch on the issues of the fines and the funding, we talked about including the overgrowth ordinance, writing that in such a way that the revenue collected through<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1487.702s">[Kit Collins]</a>: those violations will also go into the fund established by the Rodent Control Ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1492.444s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Same for that for the Wildlife Feeding Ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1494.225s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just to get those two out of the way first, those include amendments to other ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1500.027s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On the Rodent Control Ordinance itself, there's the suggestion to add IPM fees collected by the Rodent Control Ordinance to also go to the Rodent Control account because currently, so currently the fees don't go to the account, but the fines do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1517.065s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And actually, if I could pause there, Director O'Connor, if you don't mind breaking down for us the difference between fees and fines with the enforcement of the ordinance, I think it'd be really helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1595.077s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1595.957s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So as I understand it currently, so these kind of larger scale ventures, a utility company opening a road, a major development, places that have dumpsters, there are fines associated with doing those types of activities or being that type of entity in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1610.803s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They're permitted as such, and there's a fine attached to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1615.492s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Wait, is that the, that's the fee, that's not the fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1619.315s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Fees associated with that, those fees are already earmarked into the road and control account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1623.119s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And what we're talking about is adding in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1626.381s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Did I say it wrong again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1653.542s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, I see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1654.322s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Currently fines are included and fees are not, but the suggestion is to include fees as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1659.825s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1660.225s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1752.373s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1754.715s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1755.175s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Director O'Connor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1756.156s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So it seems to me that on that point, the Road and Control Ordinance already has it set that fines for violation of the existing ordinance go into the Road and Control Account, and what we're looking to do is make sure that IPM fees are also going into that account to fund more mitigation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1775.097s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, we'll work to include that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1777.918s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We can work to include that language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1781.659s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Next, there's a suggestion that the roading control fee schedule for public works street openings should be changed to a minimum of $250 plus $1 per foot with no maximum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1794.862s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do understand that that suggestion came from the city engineer's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1799.603s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If you're able to speak to that, that would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1802.044s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And if you could point me to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1804.409s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'd wanna make sure that I'm clear on, I believe it's section 6112B currently in the Road and Patrol Ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1813.094s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That'll be changed by that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1815.695s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I wanna make sure that we're tweaking the right section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1856.118s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1869.566s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Absolutely, yeah, I apologize for not doing that prior to the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1871.887s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll send this list of suggestions from Director O'Connor to the committee via the clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1881.513s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for that explanation, Director O'Connor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1884.654s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I also want to note that I think this seems to me to be pretty aligned with the work that we have begun to do in the Administration and Finance Committee of updating fee schedules across many city departments, where when we do take a look, we realize that these are kind of insufficient to cover administrative costs or out of step with what most other of our neighboring municipalities<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1907.158s">[Kit Collins]</a>: are charging for similar circumstances or similar services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1912.563s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So it's my understanding that the roading control fee for street openings relates to this because I mean and a lot of people unfortunately know this because they're living it in Medford but when a street is open when there's major<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1925.455s">[Kit Collins]</a>: drilling or some such, that displaces the rodent population and then it becomes an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1931.381s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so it's my understanding that this is another thing that is kind of very directly related to presence of rodents, rodent issues for residents, and certainly seems reasonable to me to kind of raise the floor on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1967.247s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1969.068s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll continue, I think there's just a few more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1974.497s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The next suggestion touches on adding a residential component to the road and control ordinance, which should reference compliance to the, you know, to be drafted overgrowth ordinance and the existing wildlife feeding ordinance, but should also touch on the storage of debris or refuse on residential properties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1995.416s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Specifically noted, which Director O'Connor brought up earlier,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1999.279s">[Kit Collins]</a>: is that we need some solid language that when a trash barrel has a hole in it, it must be replaced within 15 days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2009.204s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I understand that that's being suggested because there's kind of a specific problem around there being holes in trash barrels and them not getting replaced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2017.868s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it's kind of a banal thing, but that is a way that rats stay happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2023.631s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we need to find a way to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2027.196s">[Kit Collins]</a>: give the city a tool to make sure that's happening when it needs to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2030.458s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This would also touch on the mismanagement or excessive trash on private property, residential property, again, mandatory replacing damaged barrels, as well as, you know, giving the city tools to step in when there are boroughs on private property that are just not being treated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2048.348s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And, you know, kind of an additional stipulation that, you know, if there are other sundry conditions that are deemed conducive to rodent activity, again, overgrowth, overly abundant fruit trees, standing water, all these things that can, you know, create the right environment, that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2071.727s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that the health director and other city partners are enabled to step in when these conditions are creating an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2080.216s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Director O'Connor, I know that there was also, I'm curious with the residential component to hear your thoughts on the enforcement piece of this and also kind of some guidance on what you think would be actionable and fair in terms of, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2095.433s">[Kit Collins]</a>: fines and penalties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2096.554s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also know there's a suggestion to increase fines for violations on larger properties as opposed to smaller ones, like larger apartment buildings, as opposed to one or two families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2107.023s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Could you speak a bit to that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2163.35s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you, Director O'Connor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2165.451s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that this is, I think that a lot of these suggestions are ones where again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2173.752s">[Kit Collins]</a>: At least just to get the source material for what this council will what this committee will look at, we can be looking to neighboring municipalities for language that's already being used enforcement amounts fine amounts to make sure that that is kind of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2189.773s">[Kit Collins]</a>: standard with our neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2193.234s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And of course, since you know, just like this is not a neighborhood issue, but a city issue, this is not a one city issue, but a regional issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2199.456s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think in general, where there are opportunities to align with what our neighboring communities are doing, hopefully that will make that will help us all help each other and kind of keep consistent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2214.065s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One specific question that I have on the enforcement mechanism for if we're adding a residential component, Director O'Connor, I'm curious if you see the health department being the main enforcing body for this section of the ordinance, or if it should also be inclusive of, for example, code enforcement, DPW, what would your perspective on that be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2334.838s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Director O'Connor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2335.719s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm glad you raised that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2337.5s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Definitely something to put a flag on is what exemptions or exceptions or just helpful programs we can make sure exists in the language so that for folks who, you know, with all best intentions, don't have the same kind of means to respond to the new stipulations of the ordinance, that we're working with them on solutions instead of finding them where that isn't really fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2392.756s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2393.016s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2399.18s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think Director O'Connor has been really proactive in bringing forward some suggested amendments for the rodent control ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2405.324s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think I see these as being really closely aligned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2409.387s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I hope that kind of working on the overgrowth ordinance updates the rodent control ordinance and perhaps adding that line about the fund to the wildlife feeding ordinance as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2417.672s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Project that this committee recently completed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2422.148s">[Kit Collins]</a>: To me, as one Councilor, it seems really clear what we have to do here, so I hope that we can get these additions and amendments done pretty quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2433.4s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I would offer another motion, or maybe it's one motion, to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2442.048s">[Kit Collins]</a>: authorize myself as sponsor of the papers to draft suggested language, discuss with department heads, and potentially submit first drafts for legal review before our next meeting on these topics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2505.748s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2557.182s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Before I motion to adjourn, unless any of my fellow councilors have something else to add, I just wanted to also thank Director O'Connor for your stalwart efforts on this and being one of our city's foremost defenders against rats.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2568.951s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But seriously, thank you for reaching out to the council about this ordinance project that can help you and your team, code enforcement, DPW, continue to do the work that you are trying to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=0.109s">[Kit Collins]</a>: actions or on the questions that, um, how opposed comes to present bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=67.675s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=75.882s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For myself, I agree, I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=81.38s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a less is more situation, especially when we consider that any sort of green score that we do apply is a big improvement in terms of the new features and benefits that will get from that over what we currently have, which is you know we don't have this type of worksheet we don't have these types of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=97.797s">[Kit Collins]</a>: regulations right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=99.638s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think that the most important, my number one priority is kind of making sure that we are crystal clear on what goes on to that worksheet, what are the goals and the priorities that we're formulating the rubric around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=115.306s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I agree, I think that we could have, there's certainly a lot of rabbit holes to get into, especially we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=121.246s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sure we could have a very fun conversation about exactly what types of plants and trees we'd like to see in different districts around the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=129.209s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I'm going, you know, as one Councilor, I think I'll challenge myself to take this big picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=135.631s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'd be curious to hear from city staff on that question of if we're, you know, if we're trying to pick three major topics that we want to organize the rubric around, whether it's heat mitigation,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=147.916s">[Kit Collins]</a>: functional landscapes or another feature on the question of, you know, capacity for managing this policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=155.845s">[Kit Collins]</a>: How much do we think that we can fit on the menu?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=157.967s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What feels like the most important thing to have on it in terms of goals?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=318.319s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you, I'll recognize Planner Evans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=438.083s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Daniel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=438.723s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=439.344s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm hearing that in terms of capacity and making this doable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=444.506s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Apart from, let me know if I'm mishearing you, apart from the rubric of the green score itself, having a metric that just quantitatively says if a property, if a site is subject to green score or not would also be helpful so that that's not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=460.333s">[Kit Collins]</a>: getting into the more arbitrary using your best judgment side of things, which would add another layer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=465.515s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=466.576s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yep, just making it super clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=470.397s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I think that makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=471.477s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that if we are, I think that it'll be important to have a very, very clear user-friendly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=488.542s">[Kit Collins]</a>: frame around what properties are subject to this and which are not, if we're getting into, you know, drawing lines around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=495.669s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If this is to be not a universal policy, which it seems like, Paul, please correct me if I'm wrong, in all the cities that you gave example from, it sounded like it was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=510.836s">[Kit Collins]</a>: targeted at larger developments and that size threshold was different based on district and building usage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=517.962s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=533.533s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In the examples that you reviewed, it's true that in each case, green score only kicks in for buildings over a certain size threshold, but that size threshold is different depending on the zoning district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=628.78s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=630.041s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well, I think for myself, again, trying to thread that needle in between pie in the sky, let's use this mechanism to, you know, robustly elicit more of the things that we know we want to see in our city between we have the staff that we have and let's make this a policy that we can really put into action and make sure that this is manageable for, you know, developers of all sizes in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=655.819s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know I'm inclined to have green score focus on, you know, greening our urban landscape here in Medford focused on functional landscapes that bringing more diversity to the green spaces that we do have on our lots apart from just lawns which don't improve the environment as well as some other options as well as, I think, mitigating the urban heat island effect is really important and some of those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=680.054s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Greening the landscape options are, of course, you know, rhyme very well with that goal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=685.26s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When it comes to how far should this extend, where should this kick in, and how ambitious should we be, I'm kind of of two minds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=696.934s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=699.548s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, we can look at what's simple to implement and then think about like the consequences to city staff and the consequences on, you know, smaller scale developers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=709.07s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's interesting to note that in some of all the supplies to all districts and to note that smaller scale development, you know, those small development projects are still going on at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=721.914s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that there's also an argument to be made for this having kick in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=727.335s">[Kit Collins]</a>: concurrent with site plan review, especially if we're hearing from planning staff that that's what's doable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=732.976s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Though I do like the idea of expanding this to all new development in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=738.057s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that that might have to be paired with maybe for a small development, you only have to reach like 50%, for example, whereas for a big commercial development, we'd want them to get all the way to 100.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=750.68s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think we need to think through how to change the score<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=755.492s">[Kit Collins]</a>: depending on the size of the development without making it confusing or onerous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=760.954s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm curious to hear from my fellow Councilors if we have general agreement on at least the goals of functional greening and heat island effect and to kind of try to reach a decision about how far this should, how maximally this should apply to districts and developments in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=798.638s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any other considerations from our fellow councillors at this time on this topic?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=804.122s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=811.527s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=815.389s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, I'm hearing consensus around prioritizing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=817.931s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Callahan, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=833.305s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=836.348s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I caught that, were other people able to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=837.85s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=840.633s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We got you, Councilor Callahan, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=844.773s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=845.593s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well, Paola, thank you so much for this overview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=848.615s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm really excited to work together on a policy that focuses on mitigating urban heat island effect, functional greening of the landscapes that runs concurrent with site plan review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=858.641s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In terms of next steps, I am curious, what does a green score policy look like on the city council side?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=865.704s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is this a matter of just putting enabling legislation into our code of ordinances and then like the planning department<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=872.188s">[Kit Collins]</a>: develops the rubric based on our priorities or do we get into that level of specificity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=879.157s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In a language proposal on as part of this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=898.424s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Paula, sorry, that was to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=899.885s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What can we expect in terms of... Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=976.263s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, great, thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=979.264s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Appreciate that, look forward to next steps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=982.425s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I understand our next topic on the agenda is, would that be incentive zoning?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=986.386s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=987.466s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, I believe we have public participation on this item, so just quickly before we go on, Gaston, if you'd like to be recognized, you have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=1258.617s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=1260.759s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, let's get on to incentive zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=1264.162s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=1264.922s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=1945.015s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=1947.157s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On the last question, yes, we should do incentive zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=1950.459s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's a very well-suited for Mystic Valley Corridor and other areas of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=1956.483s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just quickly before I recognize Councilor Leming, just for my notes, was that example from Portland, Maine or Portland, Oregon?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=1973.168s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, that's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=1974.489s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Probably main then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=1976.049s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Leming, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2392.017s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Paula.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2393.558s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I recognize President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2536.438s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2538.779s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2539.559s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2540.819s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go to Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2568.924s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2570.045s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And yeah, I think what I keep coming back to in this conversation is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2575.031s">[Kit Collins]</a>: we're talking about a mechanism that is mostly going to be seen and useful in those zones where there is a larger potential discrepancy between minimum allowable by right height and that maximum bonus height.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2591.148s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's our squares and our corridors, especially the corridors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2595.272s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that are currently a mix of or aspiring to mixed use and commercial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2600.335s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so thinking about it in those terms, focusing it there, I think that this makes sense to target on the squares and corridors, because that's where we really have the space in terms of those potential bonuses to curate that tight list of priorities, but know that at development of those scales, we might be able to see developers who are able to have those negotiations to get affordable housing and some<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2624.689s">[Kit Collins]</a>: dovetailing with investments in transit street infrastructure, because to me that's really the use case of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2633.037s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I agree with what my colleagues have said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2635.479s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm really excited to see this pushed forward and I think that this is going to harmonize really well with some of the other incentive schemes that we're<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2648.089s">[Kit Collins]</a>: working on and kind of thinking of site plan review as a bit of a like organizational mechanism.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2652.751s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that we're considering a bunch of different incentive schemes now, but I hope that there's, you know, I think that we can stay in conversation about how to make sure that that process stays streamlined so that it's achievable for planning staff and, you know, becomes a legible, followable rule book for developers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2674.823s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It seems like we have a path forward on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2676.685s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any further comments on incentive zoning from councilors, staff, Paola, do you feel like you have a read on where we're at on this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2958.888s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Definitely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2959.769s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Pierce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2964.036s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, well, thank you for laying out the next steps on that, Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2966.937s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Really excited to start reviewing draft language around a incentive zoning policy and get into the details on exactly what districts that we discussed will comprise it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2980.502s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2981.223s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let's move on to our next agenda item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3046.24s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you for making that determination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3047.861s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3048.542s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm not sure who it was that told me condo conversion was definitely a zoning ordinance, but whoever it was, it was two years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3054.207s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm shaking your head.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3056.109s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I wasn't accusing you, definitely wasn't you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3057.89s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3060.233s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let's move on to housing definitions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3062.054s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3091.712s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Can I just cut in here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3092.672s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Can you just begin with a little context on, are these all new definitions that we're considering adding to our zoning bylaws to have them in place when new zoning ordinance makes reference to them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3107.476s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Or is there other context that we should know about these?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3159.889s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3160.59s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And if that sounds good to my fellow councillors, just with understanding, I know you've had a very long day of public meetings, I'd love it if you could give us an overview of these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3168.277s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then if councillors have questions on where the definition came from or want to get more into the weeds, please just wave your hand at me and we can pause there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3177.906s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But otherwise, I think we can just go through the definitions themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3814.192s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3814.572s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3815.794s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes, like Councilor Callahan, I think, you know, this is the type of thing that I can't really digest for the first time in a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3821.381s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think now that we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3824.189s">[Kit Collins]</a>: know that committee members have these range of options, we can consider these, come back at a future meeting and I'm sure we can quickly arrive at a consensus for which it makes sense to go with and come back with more informed considered opinions on modifying some of these examples and making sure that all the best parts from different cities templates<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3849.625s">[Kit Collins]</a>: are present in the definitions that we go with, and of course, we'll want to also consider the expertise of city staff when we're putting forward new definitions into our zoning code.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3863.075s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any other initial comments?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3866.137s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And Paola, I believe I have a file of this PowerPoint from just before our meeting, so I'll make sure that's circulated to committee members so that folks can have time to review this before we consider it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3880.51s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3881.05s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any other comments on this topic tonight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3931.923s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3932.723s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing no other comments from councilors at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3934.884s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Paolo, is this the last item on our agenda for tonight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3939.466s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think you're gonna just touch base on the status of corridors for our next committee meeting in two weeks, but we'll be saving our substantive conversation for then, is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3964.863s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3965.203s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3965.523s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We look forward to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=3967.964s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um before a solicit any final thoughts from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=4077.736s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Gaston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=4081.223s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, well, thank you all so much for this robust discussion, kickoff discussion about green score and incentive zoning and I'm glad we got to lay eyes for the first time on those new additions to housing definitions within our code of ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=4097.227s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we have our next steps for our partners in zoning on green score and incentive<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=4104.238s">[Kit Collins]</a>: zoning and really looking forward to getting some draft language on corridors and squares at our next committee meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=4111.419s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's a big step forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=4112.599s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so much of our prep work on zoning this year has been gearing up to those really major goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=4120.361s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So it's exciting to be at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=4122.981s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much to my fellow councilors, city staff for guiding us in this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=4126.362s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And of course, to you, Paola and your team and associates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=4130.603s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Looking forward to some really substantive work<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=4133.43s">[Kit Collins]</a>: between mid-November, sorry, mid-September and November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=4137.912s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any further thoughts from my fellow Councilors before we adjourn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=4144.976s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing none, do I hear a motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=4149.057s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to adjourn, seconded by Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=4157.081s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And let me check if we are still hybrid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=4164.643s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=4167.985s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Whenever you're ready Mr. Clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=4168.965s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=4190.998s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Five in favor, none opposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=4192.601s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=4193.223s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=633.61s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I found them in order, I move for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=651.377s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=652.277s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This was another meeting of the Planning and Permitting Committee with the City Council's Zoning Consultant, Ines Associates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=658.48s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I believe at this latest meeting, we were considering potential options for proposed updates to the zoning for the Mystic Avenue Corridor, as well as Salem Street Corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=671.005s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These are two of the shared priorities between the City Council,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=676.947s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the city's planning department and I know many constituents in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=681.152s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm really glad for the opportunity to prioritize that in our comprehensive look at our zoning and make sure that we are considering many goals and priorities for those two key corridors as we have this opportunity to change the zoning that will inform<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=698.909s">[Kit Collins]</a>: what it's easy to build and see and experience there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=701.892s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we will continue meeting with our, as I like to remind us every regular meeting, we'll continue to meet with Innes Associates at least monthly in the Planning and Submitting Committee, including tomorrow night at 6 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=713.244s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Move for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=768.472s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=772.609s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I've been in conversation with, among other people within City Hall, our Board of Health Director, Health Director, Director O'Connor, about some amendments to the rodent control ordinance that she and her team are seeing on their side that they believe could help them better implement best practices and rules for residents and businesses to be part of our multi-pronged approach at mitigating<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=798.815s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the growing rodent population in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=801.237s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They've identified some changes that we could make within the text of the ordinance that would give them more latitude to enforce, such as how trash receptacles are placed and maintained on property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=812.163s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've talked to a lot of people in the city and outside about this, and they say one of the problems that we're running into is just that we need to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=820.888s">[Kit Collins]</a>: keep it tighter when it comes to how trash and recycling and things that attract rodents, how those are stowed around residential and business areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=830.114s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So they've identified some changes in the ordinance that they would like for the council to consider that will just make enforcement easier on their side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=838.98s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're considering a committee meeting date for next week just to get the ball moving on that quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=844.144s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And at the same time, I believe we're also going to consider a paper that's already before the council, an overgrowth ordinance,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=851.388s">[Kit Collins]</a>: which will have some same hopeful goals of giving the city more tools to where we see those problem areas in the city that are places where rodents are congregating, where the threat population is concentrated, give the city more tools to do enforcement around making sure those are cleaned up so that we're not harboring rodents where we don't need to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=874.863s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I would motion to move this to the Public Health and Community Safety Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=893.793s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would motion to suspend the rules to take papers 24463 and then public participation out of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=974.589s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1594.735s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1595.155s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for coming tonight I really appreciate it, especially knowing that there is a another even more star studded event that you could have been at tonight thank you so much for coming and speaking to us and, you know, continuing to raise the profile of Australia and in addition to all the work that you and the rest of the board is doing every week and every month we really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1615.598s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I appreciate the, you know, kind of the reminder the call to action of how much this team is doing behind the scenes week in and week out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1625.203s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know as a Councilor, one thing that I'm that I think we're always keeping an eye on kind of on an annual basis is making sure that the casino mitigation funds I know that there's a portion of that that's earmarked for the Chevalier, we want to make sure that that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1637.188s">[Kit Collins]</a>: remains because it's so important for this very uniquely Medford institution to be able to stay important, stay special, and stay competitive when these like very large corporate venues such as Encore do come into the region.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1651.774s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In addition, I've always really valued getting those like snapshots of progress and whenever the Chevalier comes forward with the CPA application,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1660.774s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's always like this incredible pamphlet of what's been going on and how much more there is to do, whether it's restoring the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1667.341s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know there was a big organ restoration project that was wrapped up the past couple years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1671.967s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Anyway, I know that's just really scratching the tip of the iceberg when it comes to how much is going on behind those doors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1677.679s">[Kit Collins]</a>: every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1679.339s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you for, you know, platforming the membership drive, the annual meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1683.8s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would love to get more involved and get a little bit more into the details about what you all are working on all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1690.262s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think as Councilors, and especially as, you know, as residents, whenever the Chevalier is bringing in, you know, another great act every weekend, you see the cars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1698.763s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know there's so often that I'm like walking down Forest Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1701.424s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm like, wow, they got that person?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1703.184s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1703.904s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What a pull.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1705.725s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So it's visible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1707.782s">[Kit Collins]</a>: what an incredible theater this is here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1709.843s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And, you know, it shouldn't go without saying how much work goes into keeping it that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=1713.884s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2197.346s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanted to thank you for appearing tonight, and I think my fellow councilor's suggestions are good ones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2203.028s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When we consider special permits like these, we wanna make sure that we're staying within what's been afforded to other nearby residents that we're keeping with precedent that's been established.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2211.931s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I'm sure that we can, like we have in the past, work together with yourself, city staff, residents, to make sure that we seek some sort of compromise that's still an improvement for everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2222.415s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=2222.696s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Of course, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3068.834s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3070.014s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for being present to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3071.594s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for your presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3073.355s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm feeling a little confused about what's changed since, well, I'm not confused about what's changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3080.777s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm a bit confused about why there's been a change since the agreement that the council and the city department came to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3089.298s">[Kit Collins]</a>: With National Grid last fall, I think that you know we had a essentially a contract between the city and National Grid stating the agreement curb to curb and stating these conditions that there would be an equivalent square footage or whatever the proper terminology is in this case that would be restored on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3110.417s">[Kit Collins]</a>: adjacent seats close to the affected area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3112.779s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Those are the stipulations that this council added to the special permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3121.527s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we've had that in place since November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3123.869s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I admit I'm a little surprised to hear that characterized as a non-starter now, many months later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3134.625s">[Kit Collins]</a>: To be honest, I still think that the stipulations are very reasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3138.751s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm a little surprised to hear the notion of this affecting utility rates for Medford ratepayers because we know that rates are not set on a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3151.167s">[Kit Collins]</a>: granular city by city basis like that so that strikes me as a surprising thing to hear put forward in a public meeting I don't think that we should be making a decision based on that because we know that's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3162.401s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And if I recall correctly from our discussions about this last term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3169.387s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Part of the context around this conversation is National Grid did work in a similar area of Long Main Street quite recently, within five years, so this is asking the Butters to, you know, of course it's all for good reason, but it's asking the Butters to go through that inconvenience, again, in a relatively short timeline, and I think that's why it's important to make sure that if the Butters are to be put through that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3196.084s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that, you know, we get back an appropriate public benefit in the term of that curb-to-curb restoration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3203.588s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And as long as there's work being done, you know, disrupting traffic and neighbors in the area, I think it's appropriate to stick with the original stipulation that we have equivalent square footage restoration in those other areas that the Council stipulated back in November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3219.457s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3534.511s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is there work currently scheduled?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3659.113s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4406.119s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4406.439s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate the councilor for bringing this forward for lots of reasons, including we have so many discussions inside these chambers about the pretty vast budgetary needs facing so many of our city departments, including the four that are specifically targeted by linkage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4423.771s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we need to be keeping pace with other communities in adopting and evolving to those best practices for how to have sources of revenue that don't just come from sales tax and property tax because our needs are too great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4441.371s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We do have a comprehensive plan, the city of Medford comprehensive plan was put together over the course of several years with a ton of resident feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4449.078s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is on the city website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4450.679s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And there's a lot of really big, beautiful lofty goals for how to evolve the Medford that we love today into the community that we're already striving to become.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4461.029s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we know how much funding and resources those goals take to manifest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4465.252s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4467.15s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's about time that we update this mechanism so that these large developers, the only ones that are targeted by linkage are paying their fair share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4476.672s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's really all that this is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4478.033s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think it's heartening to know that some of this research was based on the city of Watertown, which in recent years, if anybody's gone down Arsenal Street, they've seen a huge development boom, heartening to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4488.795s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I lost the second place that I was going with that font.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4500.805s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In terms of the developer experience, I think that, you know, this creates a highly predictable increase that developers can know about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4507.867s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I don't have any fears attached to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4509.767s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm really glad that we're doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4510.747s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Leming, for your leadership on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4512.648s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know that City Hall staff were very helpful in the research as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4517.909s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'll second the motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4566.493s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4568.901s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this is a... We're at the...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4572.864s">[Kit Collins]</a>: culmination of an ordinance project that began last year in 2023.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4577.506s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The idea for a wildlife feeding ordinance was first brought up to me by constituents who were kind of facing this problem firsthand, which I know many people in the city and other cities face, which is there's the wrong kind of animal on my property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4594.652s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's not a pet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4596.173s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's not domesticated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4597.173s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't want it here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4598.133s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's a nuisance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4598.974s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's potentially a health hazard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4602.055s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4602.728s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Part of the reason that it might be on private property in a residential area in an environment that is not appropriate for humans or for the animal is because there are wildlife attractants out, namely food sources for wildlife.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4618.192s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I discussed this matter with our code enforcement officers, with our health director, Director O'Connor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4626.154s">[Kit Collins]</a>: with other city hall staff and received a lot of really helpful guidance on how to take a model of wildlife feeding ordinances from other cities and environments such as ours and create a mechanism so that city staff have a way to enforce around only inappropriate and problematic feeding of wildlife, the type of which is drawing wildlife.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4650.555s">[Kit Collins]</a>: animals that shouldn't be there onto residential areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4653.438s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What this is not is an ordinance that says you can't have a bird feeder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4657.562s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We specifically say you can have a bird feeder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4660.745s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The health director said we should put in language on there to make sure that bird feeders are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4665.782s">[Kit Collins]</a>: constructed properly, that they're not just squirrel feeding devices, because that's also a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4671.323s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But this is not an anti-bird feeding ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4674.124s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is not an anti-pet feeding ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4677.865s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The subcommittee on, or the Committee on Public Health and Community Safety really took its time with this ordinance to make sure that we thought through all the nuances and got the right language with advice from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4688.228s">[Kit Collins]</a>: legal counsel on how to make sure that this is targeted, just so that when there is problematic wildlife feeding going on the city has a mechanism to step in first to say, Hey, that's a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4701.398s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Please clean up your act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4702.779s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then if the problem willfully persists to issue a ticket or a fine, and this is all towards the end of making sure that our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4710.438s">[Kit Collins]</a>: beautiful private residential spaces in Medford can stay safe for wildlife and also stay enjoyable for the people that live there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4719.362s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I welcome questions from members of the council, especially those that were not on the committee where this is discussed, but otherwise I would want to thank especially our code enforcement officers, building director and health director, Mary Ann O'Connor, most of all for their guidance and a motion for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5133.328s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to thank you so much for all of your work on this program and so many other initiatives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5137.872s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's great to see Medford beginning to give, you know, our climate and climate adjacent policies the priority that they really deserve and that, you know, our residents deserve and that we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5150.323s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's great to see that we're, you know, taking a really granular look at our EB program and say, you know, we need to make sure that this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5158.389s">[Kit Collins]</a>: program, you know, kind of reaches that flywheel effect where we are getting the revenue that we need to expand it further and make it ever more easy and convenient to drive an EV in or through Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5170.654s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I really appreciate seeing this before us tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5172.595s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for your work and I'd motion for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5577.966s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for putting this together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5579.607s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm looking for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5910.35s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Gaston, if you're interested, I'm happy to share a little bit of the thought that went into this ordinance if you totally hear you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5917.019s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This was kind of the main question that we were keeping in mind when we were crafting this, because for me,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5924.204s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The goal is to have an enforcement mechanism for when accidental feeding is going awry without saying, hey, this benevolent thing that you're doing that isn't currently causing a problem, we don't wanna penalize that stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5937.412s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we worked hard to phrase this in such a way under prohibited activity, that section, to say there's no violation occurring until a problem occurs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5948.478s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So for example, if there's a fruit tree, if there's fruit on the ground,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5952.04s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If it's not attracting wildlife at such a level where anybody's ever gonna notice or file a complaint, then it's not in violation of the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5961.066s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Does that make sense?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5962.487s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If it's happening and it's not problematic, it's not in violation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5966.13s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If there's a problem going on and the board of health director or the court enforcement offer or the animal control officer visits and says, yikes, this is causing some problems, then if it's not ameliorated, it's a violation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5978.779s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If that doesn't occur, it's not a violation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5981.297s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I just offer that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=377.332s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=378.813s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This latest meeting of the Planning and Permanent Committee was once again held with the City Council's zoning consultant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=385.159s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This was kind of a fun and unusual meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=387.1s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They arranged for us a mapping workshop where their GIS specialists printed out a whole range of zoning-related maps showing different characteristics of the city from a zoning perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=400.772s">[Kit Collins]</a>: everything from lot frontage to average income in different neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=405.654s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We spread them all out in tapers in City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=408.395s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We had a lot of department heads, members of the public joined us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=411.256s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It was really interesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=412.997s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that discussion and the takeaways and questions that came out of it are going to inform our further committee meetings with the zoning consultant, beginning with the next one, which is tomorrow at 7 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=424.962s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to review the findings and questions from that committee and start going over some of our corridor strategies as well as global strategies for the zoning overhaul throughout the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=437.807s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I move for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=906.71s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would motion to suspend the rules to take papers 24-455, 24-453, and 24-454 out of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=909.351s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On the motion, I have Vice President Collins to take papers 24-455, 24-453, and 24-454 from the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=914.492s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seconded by?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=914.972s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4925.463s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4927.608s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And, you know, as a similar alternative you know I think I know the Election Commission is working part pretty much year round to publicize upcoming elections and, you know, not just make sure that people know the dates on the calendars and where to go but to do things like motor drives, you know if I would offer at the point<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4943.318s">[Kit Collins]</a>: asking the Elections Commission to add another layer to redouble their existing efforts to make sure that people know when to get out and vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4950.465s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would say, you know, there's there's a primary on September 3rd, not just in the 35 Middlesex, you know, it asked me, but we can just extend that to incorporate all voters within the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4961.514s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think everybody<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4964.176s">[Kit Collins]</a>: more people, you know, that we would think can always use a reminder about when to vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4967.478s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that goes for everybody within the city for September 3rd, as well as for the November election this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4972.399s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'd offer as an alternative, you know, I would certainly support any efforts to make sure that people know and have that date circled on their calendar and, you know, not just one district, but citywide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=4981.963s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So if we could, if you consider an amendment to have that just be a citywide effort at the point that we're going through the effort of a robocall at all, I'm sure that many voters across the community would benefit from it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5009.03s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes, for the September 3rd primary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5012.312s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Through the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5717.845s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to thank Councilor Scarpelli as well as President Bears for bringing this forward and for being so responsive to, you know, really just the latest wave of resident outreach about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5726.017s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think Councilor Scarpelli is exactly right, you know, I think that the city has been<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5732.652s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Working hard with the available tools to try to stem the tide of increasing rat populations over the past several years, but it's always seemed to me that our approach is, you know, fundamentally reactive and everybody can everybody can see with their eyes, you know that that isn't doing enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5748.937s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that the idea of a task force is potentially a great idea because there have been so many disparate approaches either tried already in the city or things that have been floated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5760.123s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it'd be great to collect some of the topics of discussion from the Solid Waste Task Force, which I was a member of a couple of years ago talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5768.607s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, how can we make sure that our evolving trash and compost receptacles are getting better and better at being rodent-proof, which is something that they are getting better and better at being rodent-proof, but it's important to share that information with the community whenever we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5781.414s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that there's a lot of pioneering rodent innovations going on in neighboring cities that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5788.438s">[Kit Collins]</a>: hear about time to time from residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5790.68s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One, because they seem more effective than just sending somebody out when we get that latest call about where it's getting especially bad, and because we do want to mitigate the effects on other members of the ecosystem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5800.686s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that we're all aware that just putting out a lot of rat poison is really harmful to the other animals that we do treasure in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5809.472s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So everything takes resources, investing in the right tools and the right systems to really attack this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5817.198s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's not going to get better without these major institutions pitching in to help us have a more systemic approach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5821.445s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I would absolutely support this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=5824.329s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I thank my fellow councilors for bringing it forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7031.877s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Not more, but just I think in terms of what, and I agree, I think that this was a lot of what was kind of negotiated while this new contract was being formed between the city side and waste management.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7041.261s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that a lot of the provisions and goals, since it just went into effect July 1, are probably still being formulated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7047.864s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think in terms of what residents can expect to see, especially in the square specifically, is consolidation, because absolutely when you have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7054.967s">[Kit Collins]</a>: one business that has overflow trash cans on the sidewalk, and another that has a dumpster, and then the other one doesn't use that dumpster, they just have a receptacle, and the next one just has a bag.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=7063.512s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It looks messy, and the more we can just keep everything in one container that really is solid and reinforced, hopefully that'll be, you know, one piece of the puzzle in getting trash off the streets, rats off the streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8365.914s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't have a question on the resolution specifically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8368.195s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I thank the councilor for bringing it forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8369.876s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that a lot of what we've heard in terms of premises for this conversation, I have an honest disagreement with at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8381.462s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that there's a lot of ways for us to have really productive conversations about settlements and liabilities before the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8391.556s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These sometimes occur in public session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8393.537s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These sometimes occur in executive session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8396.978s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Anytime we are getting more information from the administration as opposed to less when it comes to the city side of things, we have no jurisdiction over the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8404.5s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that is a good thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8405.541s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that always leaves us better off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8407.781s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That often leaves the atmosphere more productive and collaborative than it was when we were feeling under-informed prior to, you know, whether it's a meeting or a memo or just a substantive update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8421.775s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think for myself, I feel, I think, across many issues we've all had the experience of feeling under informed on various issues and then we get that bolus of information it's like wow, now we can really have a conversation about this, that leaves me feeling pretty open and flexible when it comes to what type of format or venue we receive<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8440.968s">[Kit Collins]</a>: information about settlements and liabilities in going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8444.669s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This, like a lot of our resolutions, when it comes to making resolutions to the administration, they are essentially requests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8450.352s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We cannot compel reports or requests to be filled by the administration just because of the nature of the way our government is set up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8460.516s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That being said, I hope that the administration takes this request for more information as a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8470.76s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in the best faith possible to say, it is better for us when we put our issues out on the table and we're able to have these conversations when there's fewer surprises.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8480.267s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that, you know, there's a lot of cliche ways to put this, but I think that we're better when fewer things are in the dark.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8489.873s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that it's better to shine a light on things that people are hearing about than to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8499.827s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to speculate until kind of a belated information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8503.989s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that being said, more information is always better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8508.231s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that a lot of this is very sensitive, like we saw earlier today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8510.912s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A lot of this has to be discussed in executive session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8513.233s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Some of it, you know, there's some litigations, there's some settlements that always come to the council as a matter of course, we saw that earlier this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8520.737s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I always want to correct the record when it comes to what information, you know, the city council does get<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8526.94s">[Kit Collins]</a>: certain settlements do come before us, we do appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8530.561s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, I wouldn't want to put forward a request and also forward the story that, you know, we're in this complete and total information desert in the same way that I, you know, wouldn't want it to go by that, you know, an unusual number for free cash is in some way evidence of financial mismanagement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8553.387s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8555.051s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We know from communities across the street that this was a banner year for free cash surpluses for many communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8561.475s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But in the same way, I don't think that we should need to treat settlements and liabilities like something that we cannot talk about and we cannot ask about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8571.582s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think to the extent that we are able to have a freer flow of information about this with the administration, leave us better off, leave us better able to communicate with the community when there are concerns, be able to say, this is what it really is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8585.609s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, and help us dial in on what our real problems are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=8587.93s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9565.775s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do wanna underline the point, which is reflected in city paperwork, most of which has already been reviewed by the council in public session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9576.14s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If one of the points that this conversation is about is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9581.198s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is there secret money being spent on settlements that is not known to Councilors, that is not known to the public?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9587.36s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would offer an amendment or a B paper that this information, if it's provided by the administration, also include legal department, budget to actuals for this fiscal years that are being asked about so that we can, we don't have to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9601.986s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I mean, I was going to say we don't have to take it on faith, but it's on the city website already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9605.009s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We get to see it on paper in the packet that we will receive how much money was budgeted for the legal department and how much was spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9616.84s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And with that, President Perez, that was the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9622.005s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would put that forward as an amendment if the councilor is open to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9728.8s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If I may?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9730.203s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just want to note,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9733.174s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I obviously strongly disagree that there's anything fraudulent going on, but my point with the, including the budget to actuals as context in this information is to illustrate, if we talk about managing money, what does that literally mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9744.123s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Where the money comes from, where it goes, the budget to actuals, we don't have to talk about how much money is being spent and where does it come from, we can literally see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9751.228s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I don't see why that shouldn't be a part of the conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9753.21s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And again, we do already have that information, but I think it makes sense to put all the context next to each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9758.074s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm gonna split your paper, George.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=10385.57s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for stepping up and putting yourself forward to fill this position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=10389.316s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we'd be very lucky to have you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=10390.457s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have a motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=10669.065s">[Kit Collins]</a>: 24452, resolution to support question four, limited legalization and regulation of certain natural substances on the November 5, 2024 general election ballot offered by President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=10681.84s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Whereas one in three Massachusetts residents struggle with mental health challenges, and whereas pioneering research from Johns Hopkins and Harvard Medical School find that natural psychedelics can be effective in managing treatment-resistant depression and other forms of mental illness, and whereas the FDA recently granted psilocybin, one of the psychedelics, a, quote, breakthrough therapy, unquote, designation for treatment-resistant depression,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=10705.794s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And whereas the ballot question would create a regulated framework for psychedelic-assisted therapy for adults 21 and older, now therefore be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we support question four, limited legalization and regulation of certain natural psychedelic substances on the November 4, 2024 general election ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=10797.654s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=10798.474s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any further comment from members of the council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=10803.797s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have a motion to approve from Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=10805.678s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is there a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=10806.459s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seconded by President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=10809.24s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=10912.162s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Castagnetti.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=10913.203s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have a hand from Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=11029.633s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Leming, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=11053.363s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=11054.932s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing no further comments on the motion by President Bears, seconded by Councilor Tseng to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=11061.297s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=11108.362s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Six in favor, one opposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=11109.523s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=11254.966s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No objection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=11579.948s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=11580.189s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would motion to take from the table and approve for third reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=11743.729s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to take from the table and approve for surgery day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=11746.594s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You all right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=11852.754s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=2.858s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There will be a meeting of the Medford City Council Planning and Permitting Committee, August 14, 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=9.003s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This meeting will take place at 7 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=10.524s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in the city council chamber, second floor, and via Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=13.707s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=16.329s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=31.783s">[Kit Collins]</a>: present, and I see that Councilor Callahan just joined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=52.177s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Good to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=52.728s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=55.311s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thanks everybody for your patience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=57.152s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The action discussion items for this committee meeting is again 24-033 zoning ordinance updates with the Innes Associates team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=65.981s">[Kit Collins]</a>: At our last committee meeting, which was either two or three weeks ago, I forget, we had a really great mapping workshop that Innes Associates prepared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=76.27s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We looked at many different zoning maps displaying different zoning characteristics of Medford together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=84.154s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We split them out along tables in the city council chambers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=88.115s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We could all take a look.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=89.356s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Many people made notes, asked questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=91.857s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a forum for kind of more informal dialogue and lodging notes and asking questions of NS associates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=98.44s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I understand that tonight we'll kind of have a short debrief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=102.101s">[Kit Collins]</a>: of some of the key takeaways from that forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=105.902s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Of course, there were so many, so I'm hoping that we can just quickly touch on the highlights that will most directly inform the more short-term work ahead of this committee now, which is dealing with discussing and reviewing proposed updates to Mystic Avenue Corridor and the Salem Street Corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=124.329s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I believe we're also going to hear an update on the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=128.83s">[Kit Collins]</a>: ADUs law that was recently updated at the state level, and perhaps here's some updates on the condo conversion ordinance as well on these topics are all linked because of their relevance to both district and global housing strategies throughout the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=144.549s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I recognize we are starting a little bit<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=147.659s">[Kit Collins]</a>: behind schedule which is entirely my fault I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=151.243s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Still since this meeting has a seven o'clock start I'm going to ask that we all make best efforts to wrap this up by 830 because City Hall staff has had a long day, and non City Hall staff has had a long day too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=163.335s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=164.236s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll pass it off to Director Hunt and Planner Evans if you'd like to say anything and then we can just let NS Associates take it away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=191.938s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=192.598s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=193.398s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Paola and Jimmy, thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=1673.717s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you very much, Paola, I really appreciate that thorough overview of what you've been preparing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=1679.338s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that you've incorporated some of the comments that were most recently raised at our mapping workshop just a few weeks ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=1686.419s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have a couple comments myself, but I'll go to President Bears first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=2431.616s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you President Bears and just to follow up on that point, I definitely would be interested to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=2437.281s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this is, as I mentioned, I'm really excited by this map I think this is a really important step forward in our, you know, kind of months of talks gearing up to this so thank you so much for this I think this is an excellent draft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=2448.892s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As we do consider to continue to iterate on this, you know, since I know, kind of a part of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=2454.437s">[Kit Collins]</a>: project that looms large for all of these sections is the transition between mixed-use 1, mixed-use 2, mixed-use 3, etc.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=2462.727s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would be curious to see if we can play around with a bit of a more transitional<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=2470.349s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, perhaps mixed use three or two in that section that President Bears was just bringing up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=2476.392s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And part of the reason for saying that is just to not want it to feel like a acute difference from one edge of that, you know, highway off-ramp to the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=2490.423s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I really appreciate the focus on walkability on Mystic Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=2494.366s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that transit is another big piece of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=2499.409s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know from experience, you know, I think all of us do it is difficult to be a pedestrian.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=2504.172s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is difficult to be a pedestrian on Mystic Ave, it's especially difficult to cross, but there are a lot of people who do utilize it because they need to take the bus up and down and they live in the dense housing area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=2514.4s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's just south of there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=2515.821s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So kind of thinking about that and thinking about the pedestrians that will be on the street, kind of if there's a way to implement some of that flexibility and mixed use into the commercial zone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=2525.214s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it would look better, and I think I could see some developers taking us up on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=2533.703s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One last question for me while we're on the topic of the setbacks, just to make sure I'm very clear on what we're talking about in mixed use 1, 2, and 3 with the setbacks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=2545.187s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is it that those are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=2547.924s">[Kit Collins]</a>: a condition or an incentive for increased height, or are the setbacks that you've prescribed a matter of course, and then the bonus heights come from meeting other criteria?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=2558.487s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Like, are these setbacks just baked in no matter how high the building is, or does it come in at certain levels of flooring?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=2706.729s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=2707.089s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that makes sense, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=2708.089s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanted to be clear on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=2711.505s">[Kit Collins]</a>: what the mechanism was for that, but I think that makes a lot of sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=2715.588s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it is, you know, from one perspective, it is exciting to think about, you know, if this were to be implemented, how the experience of walking or biking or even driving down Mystic Ave might be different in 20 years with more actual space to enjoy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=2732.536s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=2733.737s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I see a hand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=2734.637s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is our custom to take public participation at the end of committee meetings, but I know that we're going to be shifting gears pretty soon to the Salem Street Corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=2742.339s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Do you have a comment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=2744.14s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm happy to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=2745.64s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is there any further comments from councilors, from city staff, before we move on to the next item in Ines's presentation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=2757.064s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=2843.395s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=2843.955s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go ahead, Director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=2973.642s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=2974.222s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No, I think that stands to reason, and I would agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=2977.888s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would love to get the ball rolling on that sooner, you know, inclusive of if it's, it sounds like even rough drafts would be very useful to see in the rough stage that we can get a start on all of the accessories that have to be considered at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=2993.534s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I would endorse that request from the planning department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=3000.877s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bairst, do you have a follow up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=3004.038s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=3009.791s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Paula, is there more on this section of the presentation or should we proceed to the Salem Street Corridor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=3017.801s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=3018.021s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And actually, I'm going to interrupt you and myself really quickly in the event that this is a public comment on Mystic Gap Corridor specifically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=3024.829s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I will recognize you Gaston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=3027.152s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=3029.014s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have 3 minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=3149.432s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Paola, and I think it's, um, I definitely appreciate the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=3153.255s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm hoping that, um, I'm not sure if the appropriate mechanism would be in some design standards phase or potentially as we're getting into other criteria for height, et cetera, bonuses, if we can look to some of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=3170.99s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm trying to think of what the right terms for this is ways we can write into our zoning and perhaps this is a site plan review issue ways to kind of incentivize large developments including bike infrastructure or at least kind of like a bike accessory infrastructure on those developments as condition for greater height or just as a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=3191.596s">[Kit Collins]</a>: from a piece of what we try to incentivize in our development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=3194.978s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think the complicating factor is that Mystic Gap itself is, as we discussed largely, DOT operated, so there's not a lot that we can do in terms of the actual streetscape, but whatever we can do to incentivize making those privately held lots more hospitable for cyclists, I would like for us to look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=3245.205s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=3245.686s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=3246.93s">[Kit Collins]</a>: With that, let's move along to Salem Street Corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=3941.229s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=3941.769s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Was there more you're going to add just there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=3942.93s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Shall I open up to comment from councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=3950.896s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Good to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=3951.576s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for that overview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=3954.898s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Very interesting to consider these two corridors in parallel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=3957.94s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll go first to President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=4160.538s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Pamela.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=4162.439s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I think, I think in general and I, this is comes from personal preference and also I think from what we're heard from the community and various forums over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=4172.866s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that broadly our instinct to try and consolidate commercial especially light industrial<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=4179.61s">[Kit Collins]</a>: uses is super intuitive, makes a lot of sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=4183.352s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also think that where I see the most enthusiasm is for that mixed use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=4188.693s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so even in, you know, kind of what we're considering our commercial nodes, you know, like we mentioned along the stick, the stick out for order, I'd be really excited to see, you know, that flexibility for mixed use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=4200.958s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=4202.941s">[Kit Collins]</a>: existing commercial uses can continue to have on there, continue to cluster with other uses, that makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=4209.425s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But that we are kind of leaving a, having our zoning leave a very warm welcome open, a very open door towards that mixed use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=4219.771s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And for these nodes being<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=4225.728s">[Kit Collins]</a>: functional commercial hubs without being so obviously commercial that other uses can't picture themselves there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=4232.518s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it's my hope that some of those kind of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=4237.074s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Unappealingly resolutely industrial areas I'm in care thinking about the bus depot which I think nobody is really happy about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=4243.52s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's just something that we don't have control over right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=4245.801s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm hopeful that through zoning the adjacent areas we can hopefully entice the partners that we don't have jurisdiction over to kind of conform with how the neighborhood is changing around that depot and other<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=4261.006s">[Kit Collins]</a>: another outdated uses like it that we'd like to see go somewhere else or be converted into something more useful and more modern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=4416.684s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for that, Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=4417.964s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Director Hunt?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=4682.299s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you very much, Danielle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=4685.662s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I think this is an important discussion to have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=4687.403s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think in general, on the issue of how much height can a particular corridor or block support, typically the way I enter into that kind of question is like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=4701.459s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we all agree on the basic premise of, we need more housing units.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=4704.362s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We want to do that in a way that's appropriate and sensitive and thoughtful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=4708.386s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And when it comes to considering cases that are right now notably higher than average, the question is, what are we getting out of it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=4717.194s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What's the value to the community beyond just the units themselves?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=4722.799s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that makes me curious to contemplate, what feels like a new,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=4727.301s">[Kit Collins]</a>: what feels like an appropriate new normal that we can say we feel like this is a slam dunk, we're always comfortable with this, and then for those cases above that, whether that normal is four or five, if not six, maybe it's six, what do we want to get in return if we are going to contemplate letting a developer build above that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=4745.663s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that there's a lot that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=4748.223s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Probably a lot that we have in common that we find intriguing, whether it's parking underneath or some of those public space uses towards the front.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=4757.126s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5222.173s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I appreciate this discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5223.494s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that more so than Mystic Ave, Salem Street Corridor is a scenario where we kind of have to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5237.574s">[Kit Collins]</a>: have a bit more of a confronting conversation around what we'd really like to see here, what is the zoning we could write that could bring that about, what is likely to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5249.753s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and make our best studies and guesses at what developers are going to take us up on and what's likely to result from the zoning that we do propose and pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5259.739s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so I'm happy that we're having this conversation because I would like us to take a really serious look at what could setbacks do for us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5270.385s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What is our best guess of what could arise in 5, 10, 20 years from that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5275.288s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is there a meaningful community value that we can expect to get from that in the long term?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5279.71s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If it seems like the geography of the corridor that we just can't change unless there's a mass eminent domain campaign, which obviously it's just a joke, I don't mean that, then what is the next best<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5298.059s">[Kit Collins]</a>: um, strategy for maximizing community value on this corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5301.981s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would love to see more usable public space on this corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5306.444s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And everyone, um, I'm glad that we have Innis to help us take a, you know, a really sober look at what's our best chance of achieving that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5313.748s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, if it's really hard to do that through the geography, then, you know, we'll continue along our other goals for maximizing, um, residential usage of this corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5322.773s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5325.942s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm really excited about the step backs being a component of making the height feel friendly and welcoming and hospitable along this corridor, because we know this is such a dense area of the city already and, and yet it's not enough for all the people that want to live there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5340.537s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that could be a really great tool in our toolbox.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5344.558s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just a quick time check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5346.221s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is almost 8.40.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5346.942s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Paola, I want to pass the mic back to you before we go to public participation and just ask what else you'd like for us to hear to round out the presentation before we close out the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5506.045s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5508.503s">[Kit Collins]</a>: appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5509.103s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so just to quickly recap, unless there's any further comments by councillors, what we can expect for our next committee meeting on September the 11th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5518.886s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would love it if we can, you know, return to these topics just briefly to touch on kind of an update to the timeline when we can expect to see just even a beginning or very rough draft, something that planning department can start to chew on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5534.59s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If we can get a timing update<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5536.63s">[Kit Collins]</a>: at that time, that'd be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5537.611s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I mean, if we can get drafts before then, even if they're again, even if they're super scrappy, it sounds like even that would be useful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5543.399s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So please do feel free to send those over to myself and planning department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5548.646s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If any initial bullet points become available before that date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5553.271s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll also be going over and please correct me if I'm missing anything the condo conversion ordinance housing definitions incentive zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5562.122s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are there any other updates to the corridors plan that we can expect at September 11.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5592.233s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5593.334s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5593.614s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that sounds like, uh, more than enough for one meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5596.437s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5599.969s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll go to public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5602.19s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just name and address for the record again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5603.53s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5723.86s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Gaston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5724.7s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I really appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5725.541s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And yeah, I think we're all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5727.694s">[Kit Collins]</a>: very interested to see more data on the setbacks to inform where we go with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5734.118s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you very much for your comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5737.061s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are there any further comments or questions from councillors this evening?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5743.065s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing none on Zoom, would Paolo or city staff have any closing comments to make before we adjourn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5762.257s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5762.897s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for the advance notice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5764.799s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well, thank you so much to both of you for being here, for your insight throughout this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5768.281s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Paola, Jimmy, and Attorney Silverstein for being on the line with us, as always, and providing expert guidance on these very exciting proposals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5779.73s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Onward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5781.311s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is there a motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5785.598s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to adjourn by Councilor Tseng, seconded by, oh, nevermind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5792.121s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion by Councilor Leming to adjourn, seconded by President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5798.423s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mr. Clerk, whenever you're ready.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5817.722s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seems she dropped off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5827.567s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ytZEv67Hdoc&t=5829.627s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you all, meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=652.862s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=700.814s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sure, thank you, Chair Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=703.155s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I, again, wanna thank the Board of Health Director, Director O'Connor, and Officer Hogan, as well as the Code Enforcement Officers for, I know Director O'Connor is on the call tonight, and other city staff gave some really helpful insight onto this ordinance between,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=722.481s">[Kit Collins]</a>: this meeting and our last one when the committee reported out some specific questions for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=726.204s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just thank you so much for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=727.324s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for your time and your thoughts on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=729.626s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, at our last committee meeting on this ordinance, which I was, I want to say was in June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=735.41s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's either late May or June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=738.472s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, we had just received the legal review of the draft ordinance, which just as a recap, I, uh, this committee authorized me as lead sponsor to write that, um, which I did pulling from example ordinances from a couple<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=753.061s">[Kit Collins]</a>: communities, which it sought to create local ordinances towards the same purpose, which is essentially, you know, not to penalize anybody accidentally leaving some, you know, something tasty out for a critter one time, not to penalize your bird feeder, but just to create a legal mechanism so that if there is really inappropriate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=774.409s">[Kit Collins]</a>: intentional repeated wildlife feeding going on in inappropriate areas, such as in a backyard in such a way that it is creating a nuisance or creating a health hazard that the city essentially has cover to go and help out residents in those cases where it is getting problematic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=788.8s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So the initial draft of the ordinance came from other communities that created ordinances along the same goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=795.725s">[Kit Collins]</a>: At our last meeting, we reviewed some initial feedback from city staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=800.168s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We also reviewed<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=801.429s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the legal opinion on that draft ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=806.613s">[Kit Collins]</a>: At the last meeting, we also motioned to ask several further questions of city staff, just to kind of run some of that legal feedback by them to get their take on it from an implementation standpoint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=817.722s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So what I have prepared for tonight is a, I did a tracked changes version of the most recent draft<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=826.974s">[Kit Collins]</a>: of the draft ordinance, which does have the suggestions from legal in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=830.977s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also incorporated several of the suggestions that legal made, but didn't draft that city staff then went on to endorse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=837.921s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So what I'd like to do, if this sounds good, is to, I'd be happy to walk us through the track changes version of the ordinance, just so we can see what was suggested by whom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=848.348s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then at the end, I'd be happy to, you know, entertain motions to adopt as much of the changes the committee agrees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=856.055s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, we'd like to include.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=857.556s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that, you know, we've had a really robust process so far of getting city staff feedback on this and hearing from residents about why they want this in the first place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=865.261s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'd love it if we could kind of review all of the final tweaks and additions tonight, and then hopefully report this out to be reviewed by the full body of the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=879.81s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes, I will share my screen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=888.712s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Please let me know if this is visible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=891.114s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, looks like it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=895.717s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, I will just start running through this top to bottom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=898.018s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I mean, the ordinance is not terribly long start to finish.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=900.941s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Please feel free to interrupt me with any questions or if I should slow down or speed up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=906.984s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So once again, this is the original version of the ordinance with modifications by KP Law and then further additions based on the legal feedback that city staff said they liked and endorsed and thought would find useful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=922.51s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'll just go from the top, the purpose section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=926.972s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think this is meant to be deleted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=931.311s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Purpose and intent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=932.032s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think Attorney Braun from KP Law thought that we should start with a really high level statement of intent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=940.239s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The intent of this ordinance is to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the community via curtailing the inappropriate feeding of wildlife.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=949.799s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We then have some just slight language tweaks to the rest of that section, which was present in my initial draft of the ordinance, just kind of laying the groundwork.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=959.202s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're doing this because, you know, obviously we share permeable boundaries with the fells, many other natural areas, but we want to make sure that wildlife are staying where is appropriate for them, where they are safe, and we are not doing things to inappropriately entice wildlife into residential areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=976.286s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We talk about the nuisances and health hazards that can be created for residents, how it can hamper residents' enjoyment of their outdoor spaces when wildlife are inordinately or inappropriately attracted onto those spaces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=989.891s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And Attorney Braun included some additional color into that section here, saying it can interrupt their normal feeding patterns, cause nutritional issues, threaten their health, promote the spread of diseases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=999.615s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this is for the sake of animals, not just for the sake of residents and their enjoyments of their backyards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1006.505s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Attorney Braun also added, this ordinance should not be interpreted in any way to interfere with the authority of Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife or any other state agency with jurisdiction over wildlife.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1016.293s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think for a lot of us that goes without saying that city ordinances are subservient to state level laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1025.621s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have added a couple definitions into the definitions section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1029.384s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You can see there's some minor language changes from Attorney Braun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1033.425s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm just adding some other commonly found wildlife in Medford into our list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1038.069s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have definitions of what wildlife means, what feed or feeding means, and then what we've added.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1044.234s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Because further down in the ordinance, we reference bird feeders and that we exempt them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1051.38s">[Kit Collins]</a>: KP Law, as well as Director O'Connor, thought it'd be very helpful to have a definition of what we mean when we say bird feeder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1058.466s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We also later in the ordinance will add a section that has to do with the treatment of feral or stray cats or exceptions that make sense for people who are taking care of feral or stray cats and seeking to domesticate, neuter, and spay them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1071.731s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we also added a definition of pets just so that it's crystal clear what we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1079.074s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Then we get into the meat of the ordinance, what is prohibited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1085.631s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is substantively the same as it was in June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1089.278s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just want to highlight two substantive comments that Attorney Braun from KP Law had on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1095.868s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Attorney Braun mentioned, it might be helpful to add an intent section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1100.509s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think something that you probably heard me emphasize verbally in previous committee meetings was that the point of this is not to, you know, create a way to ticket somebody who like accidentally leaves out something that an animal construes as feed and eats on one time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1116.113s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're not looking to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1118.773s">[Kit Collins]</a>: police people's behavior, or trying to distinguish between repeated inappropriate intentional wildlife feeding and stuff that just happens one time or accidentally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1128.416s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so following that suggestion, we added subsection B, whenever the animal control officer becomes aware that wildlife has been found feeding on any substance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1138.238s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and the resident for the property has been notified thereof, any subsequent feedings shall be evidence that the feeding was with the knowledge or intent of the resident or the person responsible for the property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1149.327s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So essentially that's saying it happens one time and it's enough of a problem that the animal control officer hears about it, he or she will first say, hey, it seems like this is becoming a problem, don't do it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1161.576s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then if it happens again, when we know that notice has been given, then we can start that kind of enforcement ladder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1169.184s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Attorney Braun also suggested, in addition, having to do with if animals are feeding on substances found within outdoor trash or compost receptacles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1181.672s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And here it's, you know, a very similar theme.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1187.675s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If animals are getting into, if a trash or compost receptacle is compromised and it's causing enough of a problem that the animal control officer or director of health hears about it, first they will just get in contact with the resident or property owner and say, hey, it looks like this is causing a problem that's escalated to the level of a nuisance, please fix it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1207.412s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Then if they have the opportunity to do so and they don't,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1210.916s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, then the city does have a mechanism to intervene again, again, just to make sure that wildlife are not making a habit of inappropriately feeding in residential areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1223.595s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We then get into exceptions, and this is largely unchanged for the last time we reviewed this ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1230.438s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to prohibit bird feeders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1234.06s">[Kit Collins]</a>: However, if a bird feeder is determined to be the cause of a public safety threat or nuisance, then the animal control officer, health director, or code enforcement officers can intervene to have it removed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1244.664s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But again, like the standard here is bird feeders are okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1247.745s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Bird feeders are not often an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1250.206s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We also add<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1252.887s">[Kit Collins]</a>: or also we kept the exception that this has nothing to do with normal appropriate feeding of pets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1261.931s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Again, it's the same thing as if your trash bin has a huge hole in it and raccoons are getting into it, that's an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1269.995s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Ditto if you keep your dog food outside and raccoons are getting into it, that's an issue too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1273.917s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But if it's not an issue, it's not an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1277.335s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a new section that we talked about at length in our last committee meeting in June on stray or feral cats.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1284.098s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think Chair Lazzaro raised an important point that she had heard from some residents essentially saying like, hey, there are people who, you know, for years have volunteered in the community to do the work of, you know, essentially trying to humanely bait stray and feral cats so that they can be neutered, vaccinated, hopefully domesticated, adopted as pets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1307.97s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Attorney Braun had some helpful language around this, and Officer Hogan and Director O'Connor also gave a lot of great insight on this, endorsing this exception and pointing to the feral cat caretaker ordinances in Medford's Code of Ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1325.373s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we came up with this language to say explicitly no person shall feed any feral or stray cats with the following exceptions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1333.075s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If you are registered as a feral<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1335.735s">[Kit Collins]</a>: cat caretaker per this ordinance, you know, there's an exception for you, that work is registered, that work is fine, this ordinance will not interfere with you continuing that work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1346.939s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It says explicitly this section is in no way intended to hinder the work of duly registered feral cat caretakers, and I think this is the language suggested explicitly by<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1357.682s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Officer Hogan or Attorney Braun, this section shall not apply to persons feeding feral or stray cats with the express purpose of adopting and domesticated said cats.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1366.908s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that these specific timetables and citations came from Attorney Braun, which points to mass general law on the topic of vaccination and domestication of feral cats.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1382.595s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know that Officer Hogan ran this section past, I believe it's Medford Kitty Connections, if I have that right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1393.886s">[Kit Collins]</a>: leader from that organization did mention, you know, occasionally, depending on the situation, we do have to sometimes feed feral cats for more than 14 days, depending on the situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1402.489s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we just included here, if, if there's a litter where the feeding has to go on for more than 14 days before the next steps are taken, I know that the officer control officer and Medford Kitty Connections or other federal cat caretakers are always in communication about situations like these anyway, so that can go on at their discretion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1419.696s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'll pause because I see Councilor Callahan has a hand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1477.281s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, thank you for mentioning that, because I definitely said that out loud, and I think I probably just assumed that spaying and neutering is something that is always done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1483.762s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm not sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1485.263s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've never, I'm not deeply familiar with the trap neutering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1491.544s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know there's an acronym, I believe it's TNR, but I'm forgetting what the T and the R stand for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1496.265s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Release, trap neuter release.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1501.349s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, trap, neuter, release.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1502.91s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, thank you, whoever that was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1505.633s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think in this case, I don't think that this ordinance should prescribe what goes on after the cats are fed and vaccinated, but I appreciate you flagging that, because I wouldn't wanna, I don't wanna say something inaccurate on record, not knowing what the protocols are after they are vaccinated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1529.676s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that's a major new section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1531.938s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The rest of this is pretty true to what we reviewed a couple months ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1537.983s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In terms of enforcement, the animal control officer, health director, code enforcement officers, and Attorney Braun also added police officers, are all authorized to administer and enforce the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1550.633s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is enforced according to MGL Chapter 40, which is true of, I believe,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1559.301s">[Kit Collins]</a>: all kind of non-criminal disposition of many of our regulatory ordinances at the city level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1564.298s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have the same kind of offense letter that we had from our earlier reviews of the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1570.582s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The first offense is just a written warning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1573.063s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The second offense, that's again, after the problem has been raised and discussed with whoever is deemed to be committing the violation, the $50 citation, and then the third and each subsequent defense is $100 citation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1586.972s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've also added the effective date of immediately upon passage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1592.085s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'll pause there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1593.346s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thanks for bearing with me through that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1594.567s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I, again, want to thank Director O'Connor and Officer Hogan and the code enforcement officers for reviewing this a couple of times as this was going through some suggested edits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1628.47s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'd be happy to pull it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1723.506s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Chair Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1724.646s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'd be happy to make those motions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1725.927s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I did just want to, again, recognize Director O'Connor<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1729.958s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and I'm not sure if Officer Hogan is on the call, but if there's any city staff who were very helpful in crafting this, if they'd like to speak to any aspect of this or raise any final ideas or adjustments, I'd love to hear those before making the motions I planned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1806.383s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Director O'Connor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1807.464s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm glad you brought that up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1810.168s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this is kind of interesting, because I believe in a lot of our other city ordinances, we do include, you know, ex-city staff member or their designees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1818.596s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Attorney Broad, in this case, offered a legal opinion that, in their opinion, according to, I believe it's MGL Chapter 40, Section 21D, is a, oh wait, I'm not sharing my screen anymore, hang on a sec.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1840.973s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Attorney Brown said, specifically, though attorney general review is not applicable to city ordinances, the AG has clarified that under chapter 40, section 21D requires that the bylaw identify the enforcing persons, this decision number 1096 from 2021.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1859.0s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If an ordinance allows a party to designate an enforcing person at a later time, it therefore does not identify the enforcing persons in the ordinance itself and fails to put the public on notice of such enforcing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1870.25s">[Kit Collins]</a>: persons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1870.991s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So essentially, this was also, let me try and frame that in human English.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1874.937s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A lot of our ordinances do use the language of, you know, say, for example, the director of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1884.445s">[Kit Collins]</a>: director of public health or their designee, this opinion says that's actually generally disapproved of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1888.669s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't know that it's illegal or out of bounds, but it sounds like recent decisions have discouraged that so that it's crystal clear for the public who exactly the enforcer is to list all of those persons by title in the ordinance itself, instead of saying this department head or their designees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1906.947s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that's, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1908.869s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I kind of like being able to assign it to a department head and say, you know, whoever they want to delegate it to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1914.711s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that is really streamlined from an implementation standpoint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1917.692s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But by way of explanation, that's why that was taken out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1929.075s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1929.335s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is there any other titles from your office that we should add to that list?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1940.769s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sanitarians instead of health inspectors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1944.713s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=1973.547s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I'm gonna do a quick search for where it identifies the animal control officer as the administrator and make sure that the health director and sanitarians are included and code enforcement officers are included in that list as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=2021.575s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=2022.175s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, unless there are any other, I would certainly welcome any further comments or questions from members of the public or city staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=2033.839s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But barring that, I'd be happy to make a motion to adopt all of the changes reflected in this draft changes document that we've reviewed tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=2045.226s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to adopt the additions, the deletions from city staff and legal review that were present in this draft, and then report that amended draft out to the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=217.84s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Anna's here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=222.665s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=223.605s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor is saying that was present as a non-voting member last time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=235.256s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I'll kick us off and then I'll throw it to you for if there's anything you want to add.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=246.675s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just let me know whenever you're ready.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=248.356s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=252.497s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There will be a meeting of the Medford City Council Planning and Purbanning Committee, Wednesday, July 24th, is that right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=260.1s">[Kit Collins]</a>: 5.30 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=261.581s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The purpose of this meeting is to go for paper 24-033, which is comprehensive zoning updates in collaboration with the city council's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=271.164s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Zoning consultant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=272.365s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The format of this committee meeting is going to be a little bit different than usual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=276.887s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have arranged to have a zoning mapping workshop prepared by Innes Associates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=283.151s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So for the first give or take 90 minutes, councillors, committee members,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=288.934s">[Kit Collins]</a>: City staff, members of the public are going to be circulating, looking at the zoning maps which were presented by Innes Associates at a couple previous committee meetings, asking questions, making notes on sticky notes for further review and discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=306.47s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All of this will inform our future work on tweaks to the zoning map, housing strategies and other strategies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=314.036s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Then around 7 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=316.317s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm going to reconvene us to our typical format, where we'll have a discussion about the main threads to come out of this discussion, questions we'd like to pose to experts, to department heads, to the public, based on what came out of the mapping workshop discussion and the questions on the sticky notes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=334.121s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we'll go until about 8 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=336.902s">[Kit Collins]</a>: reviewing that discussion and talking about our next steps, particularly along<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=341.104s">[Kit Collins]</a>: zoning changes along some of our corridors and housing strategies both corridor level and globally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=346.752s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'd like to pass it off to Director Hunt if you have anything else to add or Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=452.948s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=453.268s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for that introduction, both.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=454.789s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for preparing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=455.85s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just to underline that last point, blue sticky notes are for general questions and comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=461.033s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Green sticky notes are for questions that we might like to pose to the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=465.976s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go forth, have fun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=467.917s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll reconvene us around 7 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=469.538s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=5065.303s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that this conversation about where the conversation goes from here can be part of the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=5076.049s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, no, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=5103.792s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we've had, I think, a very substantive 90 minutes in our, what we're calling our mapping workshop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=5113.056s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know I contributed a lot of sticky notes to the maps that NS Associates created and laid out for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=5120.279s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=5121.56s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I definitely saw a lot of sticky notes from other Councilors and department heads, members of the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=5128.103s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The intent for the second half or the final third of this meeting was to kind of briefly recap the mapping workshop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=5138.31s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If anybody feels called to, you know, kind of shout out a thread that they heard or discussed or saw very often, or if there's any major bottom lines that they wanted to articulate that they wrote down or talked about with other attendees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=5155.854s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we can speak to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=5157.595s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then the other intent for this part of the meeting was to discuss our kind of most immediate next steps on the housing strategies piece of this work, as well as our most immediate next steps on our two priority corridors, those being Salem Street and Mystic Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=5175.848s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So like for Innes Associates, department heads, Councilors, feel free to speak to any part of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=5181.632s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that all of these are obviously very intertwined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=5184.274s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that a lot of our comments from the mapping workshop are going to touch on those priority issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=5190.398s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So if any of my fellow Councilors would like to raise any thoughts, questions that came up during the mapping workshop, I'm happy to turn it over to Emily and Paula to discuss our next steps on the corridors and housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=5209.744s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing none, we can popcorn around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=5420.677s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=5421.198s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=5421.92s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know for myself as one Councilor, I think we've been talking about a lot of the same priorities for a lot of this term and prior to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=5431.465s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, including when you were assisting the city of Medford in a previous role, helping us with our comprehensive planning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=5437.387s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so it's, it's exciting to get to the point where, you know, we're kind of visualizing and articulating a lot of these goals in various ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=5445.01s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And our next step being to, you know, use our use you as our technical assistance in bringing these goals into language into the zoning changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=5457.214s">[Kit Collins]</a>: First,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=5458.499s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in these priority corridors, expanding into the squares and kind of having these global strategies inform corridor strategies and vice versa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=5467.326s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think it makes a lot of sense procedurally to focus on certain geographic areas, have those discussions of what do we know that we want for this zone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=5476.653s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What are people already asking for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=5478.855s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What have people been asking for for Mystic Ave, for Salem Street, for Medford Square for years?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=5484.74s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What changes need to be made that make sense for this area?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=5487.762s">[Kit Collins]</a>: what makes sense for the area adjacent to that, adjacent to that, what strategies make sense for the community overall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=5494.206s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think this is the beginning of an exciting process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=5498.83s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In terms of our next steps, I know that several of these strategies are already in the works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=5503.753s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've talked before, for example, one out of many for making ADUs by right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=5511.098s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that there are several items in the queue that we might expect to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=5514.941s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We might be able to review language at a meeting soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=5518.224s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are there any updated thoughts on what pieces of language you might like the Council to review and give feedback on at our next meeting or the one after that, whether it's a global strategy or, you know, addressing the corridors first?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=5564.282s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm so sorry, could you repeat the last part?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=5567.783s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The sound is very loud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=5589.821s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=5591.822s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=6345.264s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for that discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=6347.83s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm inclined to agree that if we have a window of opportunity to, in a reasonable baseline that seems unproblematic, I like taking opportunities to make improvements when they avail themselves, knowing that, knowing and telegraphing that an opportunity for more tailored tweaks and further amendments will be shortly forthcoming as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=6369.936s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And kind of towards the same point, I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=6372.386s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It would be great to, even if it evolves over the course of the year, to have that draft timeline of when we're going to be discussing particular corridors, neighborhoods, to be able to broadcast that early and also broadcast when those meetings get shuffled around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=6388.692s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that that will sort of help reinforce for people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=6392.287s">[Kit Collins]</a>: through another way, what this project is all about, which is hitting all of our priority areas, having this comprehensive approach and breaking down when different pieces of it are going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=6403.253s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That'll help keep us on schedule as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=6407.216s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any other questions or comments from Councilors in this department heads about our next steps for August?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=6415.553s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and they're on afterwards, or any other threads that we want to call out from the mapping workshop earlier?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=6421.857s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's a lot of great stuff, but I know we discussed it very in-depth around the tables.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=6446.018s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I'll echo that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=6446.779s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It was great to have that discussion include people who aren't, you know, always a part of these conversations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=6451.502s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I hope we can, you know, have that again at our conversations that are more neighborhood and corridor and other specific focuses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=6489.073s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yep, totally agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=6489.993s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's just a value add.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=6492.734s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, well, thank you so much for your hard work that went into the format of this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=6497.876s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm excited at our meeting in August to begin to dig in deeper on the corridors, begin that granular moving outward kind of conversation and to sketch out a plan for how to approach that through next spring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=6515.143s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any other closing comments from councilors or other attendees?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=6521.792s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing none, thank you all so much for a really productive conversation, a really productive exercise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=6526.175s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Really grateful to everybody for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=6527.557s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Moved to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=6532.3s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seconded by President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=6536.103s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=6536.784s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=6537.885s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=6539.126s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T1o-WALn6Tw&t=6540.186s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=454.053s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=455.474s">[Kit Collins]</a>: At our June 25th meeting of the Planning and Permitting Committee, we met once again with the City Council's zoning consultant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=463.682s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The topic this time was to go over in more detail a work plan for the remainder of the year and the term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=471.35s">[Kit Collins]</a>: With that zoning consultant, moving plans and goals that have been placed in Medford's comprehensive plan, housing production plan<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=479.175s">[Kit Collins]</a>: climate action and adaptation plan and other public city plans into pieces of legislation that the council can consider debate and vote on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=487.241s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And at that meeting, we determined that the next meeting of the planning and permitting committee, which happens to be tomorrow, Wednesday, we would go over detailed zoning maps with the zoning consultant, followed by a discussion of housing related topics to further our work on global and district level zoning changes in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=506.935s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and to begin talking about housing-related issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=510.418s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=966.003s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears, did Councilor Scarpelli move the question or is debate still out on the floor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=986.727s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll happily defer to Councilor Callahan while I collect my thoughts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1234.192s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1236.323s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli for bringing forward this topic of discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1239.205s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Callahan for your words.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1250.271s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Pardon me while I get my thoughts together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1251.551s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'd like to...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1258.217s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, I agree that the words accountability and transparency are used so often that they tend to lose meaning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1265.401s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think in this case, we're kind of having a community-wide discussion about what does transparency look like?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1270.224s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are we currently seeing it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1271.204s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Where aren't we seeing it that we would like to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1274.026s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think if we want the city council to be transparent, then we have to be the forum that states the facts where there's misinformation going around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1283.111s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is true that the city gets audited every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1286.598s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That is a fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1287.939s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would not want to be untransparent and pretend that that is not the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1292.121s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That is the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1293.722s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The city is audited every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1304.127s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It makes me saddened as a member of this council, as a colleague,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1311.823s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to see our discussion and debate behind the rail go to this place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1317.672s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I see bodies like this as<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1322.071s">[Kit Collins]</a>: enacted for the purpose of having disagreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1325.453s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have had a lot of disagreement this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1327.835s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've had a lot of disagreement the previous term, my first term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1331.077s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There was plenty of disagreement the term before that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1333.699s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That is not a bug.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1335.14s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That is a function.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1336.601s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That is what democracy looks like, is getting people from the community who disagree with each other to represent the community, to have disagreements and try either by compromise or by vote<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1349.485s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to find a path forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1351.488s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And hopefully a lot of the time we'll find our way to the best path forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1355.735s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And if we don't, that's why we have elections and new people take these seats and they'll have a disagreements again, and maybe they'll arrive at different<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1363.868s">[Kit Collins]</a>: decisions by compromise or by vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1368.209s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's worth noting that the invoking of, I know that there's a couple issues at play here behind what was explicitly written about in the letter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1379.232s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's worth noting that some of the inflammatory motions here that predated Councilor Scarpelli's communication to our partners at the state level,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1391.295s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the invoking of Rule 21 and the suspension of Rule 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1394.758s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just want to state a few things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1397.46s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One, council rules are council rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1400.822s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've amended the council rules in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1403.084s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That can be put forward by any councillor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1405.386s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's a thing that councillors are allowed to do and that we vote on them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1410.049s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also think it's worth noting that rules have been suspended for time immemorial, at least as long as I've been paying attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1416.974s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's not new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1418.455s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Rule 21 has been invoked since I started paying attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1421.657s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's not new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1423.899s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Rules have been suspended for various reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1427.261s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For as long as I've been watching these meetings, that's not new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1430.843s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think, you know, when I look at the current climate,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1436.377s">[Kit Collins]</a>: behind this rail at this team of people who were elected to work together and disagree together and take votes together, makes me wonder what's changed that instead of taking votes and moving on, taking votes and trying to find compromise and using the forum of the debate to try to be persuasive, try to listen in good faith and talk in good faith, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1466.906s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is hard for me to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1469.988s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But a lot of people behind this rail are speaking my mind, so I think that it's only fair that in the spirit of productive disagreement, you know, we do the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1479.174s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1481.016s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that any member who finds themselves on the losing side of any vote to see that for what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1488.36s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think they owe it to this body to continue in the spirit of productive disagreement, not to gum up the works of the body through<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1499.918s">[Kit Collins]</a>: making allegations or accusations of inappropriate behavior, of breaking of the rules, of inappropriateness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1509.583s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that is harmful to what this body does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1512.505s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think it's fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1513.886s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think it's good sportsmanship.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1516.327s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think it helps this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1519.309s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I hope that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1522.179s">[Kit Collins]</a>: after this spate of, frankly, misinformation that this community has been weathering and conversing about for the past couple of months, we can get back to a place where we say, we want this body to be productive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1534.368s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We don't want to sling mud at each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1535.709s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We don't want to use our state-level partners as a forum for trying to bring each other down by claiming inappropriateness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1548.171s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let's debate, let's discuss, let's disagree, let's yell at each other if we have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1552.192s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's nothing new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1554.152s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then let's take the votes and move on and let's remember that we're all here because of votes that were cast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1562.734s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that happens every two years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1564.714s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I don't think it is helpful for our community at all to let<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1574.656s">[Kit Collins]</a>: these accusations of inappropriateness and illegality or allegations that heavily imply inappropriateness and illegality into the conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1587.505s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think that is in the best interest of this body, which continues as a body after all of our terms are over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=1593.33s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2842.687s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Beasley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2859.471s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that being behind this rail carries a lot of responsibility, collectively and individually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2867.674s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When I speak about allegations, part of what I mean is that the narrative that we perpetuate as individuals and as a collective, we are responsible for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2877.698s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's very powerful in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2880.762s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The allegation, I think, is the narrative that has been created to draw a link between some of these events that a councilor is mentioning in past meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2897.247s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think it is responsible to further a false narrative that actions taken by this council are towards the goal of silencing an opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2909.019s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I wanna briefly walk through a few items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2910.94s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One, and what I mean by the narrative is I think that what we're kind of all talking around is this narrative of one Councilor is being willfully silenced by collective actions of another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2924.028s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That is a very compelling narrative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2926.19s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's a very compelling story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2929.972s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm gonna keep talking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2943.968s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The first meeting, Rule 21 was invoked to delay the free cash paper by one meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2949.693s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to remind people that Rule 21 is an undebatable motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2953.277s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is not the case that this is a collective action taken to silence that idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2958.702s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Frankly, not that it matters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2960.123s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I wasn't in favor of tabling<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2963.049s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2964.009s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I didn't like that that happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2966.21s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It didn't matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2966.79s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's undebatable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2967.97s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2968.471s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It wasn't a collective action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2969.911s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't know the councilor's intentions in doing it, but it doesn't fit this narrative of collective action to silence one group, one person, or a constituency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2980.014s">[Kit Collins]</a>: At the next meeting, yes, I suspended the rules to say that we can't do rule 21 at this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2987.856s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In general, I am not a fan of rule 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2991.266s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think it's productive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2993.729s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that it's something we should discuss as a council, whether it's worth keeping inside of our council rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=2998.676s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My explicit reason for doing it at that meeting was not to be a part of a coordinated effort to silence one person, group, or constituency, but because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3008.396s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It was my understanding, and I believe this is true, that if we were to delay the budget past, if we were to not vote on the budget at that meeting, that would have pushed us past the deadline of issuing pink slips to teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3025.81s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so if rule 21 had been invoked and we had tabled the budget, a lot of teachers would have gotten pink slips.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3033.737s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I didn't have to, because the budget wouldn't have been finalized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3036.88s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That was my understanding, and that was my motivation for taking Rule 21 off of the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3041.704s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You can disagree with it, but it doesn't fit the narrative of just being a coordinated effort to silence one person, group, or constituency, and I won't further that narrative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3051.013s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One other thing I want to say while I have the floor,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3054.557s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's a perpetual thorn in our side, this issue of free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3059.421s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One, because it's called such a confusing and inaccurate term, free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3066.768s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3067.349s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's the community's cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3075.556s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm going to finish.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3076.817s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm going to finish my point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3083.206s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Free cash occurs when money that was budgeted to be spent was not spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3087.768s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's true that we have allocated up until our last city council meeting when we appropriated some of that free cash, that it is amassed to a very large number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3099.034s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Why are some neighboring communities have a balance of four or five million in free cash at a given time and we had 34?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3105.818s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Because we were one of the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3109.3s">[Kit Collins]</a>: 3% of cities and towns in Massachusetts that had never ever set up a stabilization fund, which is a savings account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3115.365s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's why ours was growing and growing and growing, essentially in a checking account, a checking account that you can't use most of the year, instead of being appropriated into funds and departments where it can actually go to work for you, the taxpayers, for us, for our city departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3134.52s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's why that number grew so large, because we never appropriated it into a stabilization fund or a capital stabilization fund, both of which are mechanisms that we set up at the last meeting in June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3147.564s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I just wanna add a little bit of, I just wanted to add that context to the discussion, because I can totally understand that it sounds egregious to say we have $34 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3156.307s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And again, my analogy, I'm not a finance expert, is to say we have $34 million in a checking account,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3162.628s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Why the heck would that be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3164.249s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well, now we don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3165.571s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Now we've put it into funds where it can actually go to use for the city, for the schools, for the taxpayers because of votes taken at the last meeting in June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3173.638s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that's important because now it can actually be put to use for the residents and taxpayers of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3476.454s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Paris.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3478.137s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I had finished my point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3934.032s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, there's just so much to talk about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3935.513s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3941.336s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3944.397s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, I think this is one of those issues where I think we really do agree in what we want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3950.699s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we see it, we see what's happening differently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3956.26s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What really nettles me is we have so much, it's not like what we say, people in the community believe, because obviously that's not the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3967.003s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think we, having one of these microphones is really powerful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3971.145s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It comes with a lot of influence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3973.7s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think every person behind this rail is in their way, in their different ways, really sensitive to the role that they occupy, the voice that they have, how people hear them, how they're framing the issues, how they're hearing the issues from the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3989.349s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that every Councilor behind this rail is very sensitive to the type<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=3994.509s">[Kit Collins]</a>: of leader and listener and speaker and representative that they are perceived to be by the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4001.771s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's why it is so upsetting to me when behind this rail, we further narratives and binaries that I think are both not true, but actively harmful to our ability to come together and work together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4018.037s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For example, setting up a binary between<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4023.43s">[Kit Collins]</a>: talking about your assumptions and opinions as though they are fact in a city council meeting versus meeting with department heads who are duplicitous to further your own agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4036.153s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That binary does not exist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4039.053s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I don't think it is helpful to put that forward as your two options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4044.815s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's not what happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4047.115s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's not what happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4049.356s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also don't think it's helpful<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4053.584s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to set up a binary between winning a vote and being actively silenced, we've all been on the losing side of the vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4069.575s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And whether we feel maligned by that or victimized by that, I don't think it's fair to how we talk about these issues to get to pick and choose when we're going to waive that as a flag.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4083.772s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it's not that I want to minimize the experience of having something that you ardently believe in and getting shot down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4090.336s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that sucks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4092.057s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've been there many times, my first term especially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4097.36s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think it is deeply unhelpful to the community, to this body being able to function at what it's supposed to do for us to broadcast that our two options are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4110.387s">[Kit Collins]</a>: be a winning vote for some nefarious agenda or be a stymied, silenced constituency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4117.369s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Because I think that, you know, we talk about that's why we're divided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4122.13s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's nothing more dividing than being told we're divided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4126.091s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I wish that we came into these conversations not already mad at each other, but willing to say what's happening here and being willing to listen to the answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4137.454s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We had a conversation with the finance director<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4140.401s">[Kit Collins]</a>: before the budget about free cash projections, what it's been in the past, what is projected to be, why free cash accumulates the way that it does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4149.448s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think it's fair to residents to keep having this conversation about how our accumulation of free cash, which has now been put into funds where it can be used for purposes throughout the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4161.318s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think it's fair to the residents to keep talking about this like it was some scheme.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4169.532s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't get why it's fair to the people of this city to keep beating a drum that misinforms people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4181.263s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's okay if you disagree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4182.584s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wish that we were able to talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4185.146s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4714.482s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Hopefully this will be the last time I speak on this paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4716.342s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanted to note two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4721.544s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I hear you that you wish there had been minutes coming out of the financial task force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4726.525s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, maybe the next time this is necessary, it'll be formed by committee instead of being a flexible ad hoc group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4735.401s">[Kit Collins]</a>: thing is that any decisions that came out of this task force were put to a vote in a public meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4740.724s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I also think it's really relevant to note, I think it's a very critical distinction that any proposals came out that were discussed in the financial task force, of which I was a member, put forward to the city council, we approved them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4760.477s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any residents who feel<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4765.712s">[Kit Collins]</a>: skeptical or uncomfortable or just disapproving of the proposals or of the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4773.634s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What do you do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4774.254s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You go to the polls and you vote no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4778.095s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's the difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4779.515s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4780.875s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's your right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4782.195s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's your right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4783.716s">[Kit Collins]</a>: From now until the election, residents who happen to be in favor of the proposals<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4789.813s">[Kit Collins]</a>: we'll be making the case for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4792.154s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There will be a lot of answers coming out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4795.115s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's the process, because this is a thing that everybody gets to vote yes or no on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4799.937s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We will not be making that case from the podium because this is a matter that's going to be voted on, that would be improper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4805.979s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But this information, this case will be made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4808.38s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We will have a chance to discuss and debate the answer to those questions by we, I mean the community, in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4818.183s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let's see if I can remember the second point I was going to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4820.004s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I might have lost it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4827.706s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's been a long day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4829.887s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll come back to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4830.887s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4892.522s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4893.222s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4894.122s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sorry, I remember the point I was gonna make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4897.223s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know, you're all thrilled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4899.844s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do just want to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4902.267s">[Kit Collins]</a>: highlight, remind folks that the council did take a vote to have a committee of the whole, maybe sometime in the summer, early in the fall, to meet, to have a public meeting where the administration is present and we discuss the use of funds in our stabilization account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4916.596s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just to let that be known, that's a vote that was already taken so that we can have a public discussion about free cash, where it went, how it's going to be used, because I know the administration has had a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4929.17s">[Kit Collins]</a>: ton of capital needs that a lot of that funding is already in demand for these capital projects that were already in the queue, paving, sidewalk repair, city infrastructure, and so on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4944.519s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also think it's worth noting that the difference between saying, let's not even propose an override versus putting an override on the ballot and it fails,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4959.221s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Same outcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4961.022s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And lastly, I wanna note, again, I was not in favor of the Rule 21 motion to delay the vote on Councilor Scarpelli's free cash paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4972.29s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The fact that we set up a stabilization fund and a capital stabilization fund and moved some of our 34 million reserves of free cash into the stabilization funds means that we can now use it<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4986.616s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Because of that, we could now use that money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4989.359s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And if we hadn't done that, that money would be unusable to the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4993.983s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's a fact, you can shake your head, but that's a fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4997.086s">[Kit Collins]</a>: While the state is certifying free cash, we cannot touch it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=4999.488s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I still have not heard a compelling reason why making that surplus, that cash reserves unavailable to the community for the needs that we know we have, I fail to see<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5011.621s">[Kit Collins]</a>: why that is a better outcome than having it in funds where it is available to be used for the needs that we know we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=5018.288s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm sorry, I really will shut up now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bg8-wFn44kc&t=6437.206s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=719.855s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There will be a meeting of the Medford City Council Committee of the Whole, June 26, 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=724.158s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This meeting will take place at 6 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=725.939s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in the City Council Chamber, second floor, Medford City Hall, 85 George P. Hassett Drive, Medford MA, and via Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=732.464s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Madam Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=768.007s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=771.589s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Five present, two absent, the meeting is called.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=782.161s">[Kit Collins]</a>: By present to absent, the meeting is called to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=787.724s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The action and discussion item for this meeting is 24-006 offered by President Bears, review of the 2024-2025 council governing agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=800.793s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So as a brief refresher, this term, for the very first time, Medford City Council, at the beginning of the term, put together a governing agenda which lays out submissions from each councilor who chose to submit proposals, either that were already in committee from previous terms or new ideas, things that the City Council would like to work on over the course of this term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=826.185s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The process for putting together this document<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=828.843s">[Kit Collins]</a>: was paper 24-006 proposing the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=834.404s">[Kit Collins]</a>: After that, there was a period during which councilors submitted proposals to council leadership, myself and President Bears, which were then organized into this document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=843.866s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We had a committee of the whole, like this one, we were discussed which committee each project ought to go into.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=851.228s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And each project, if it didn't already have a paper number, has been,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=856.249s">[Kit Collins]</a>: assigned a paper number as it's been proposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=858.63s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So in this meeting, we are going to have our first check-in on this document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=862.912s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Now that's halfway through this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=867.074s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's a quarter of the way through the term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=869.875s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this is a status meeting to review all of the papers currently in the governing agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=876.858s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so the process for this meeting, we have about,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=882.678s">[Kit Collins]</a>: 45 minutes, we're not gonna go past 7 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=885.659s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to review the overall document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=887.719s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's a long one, as people remember, that's quite a lengthy document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=890.94s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're going to go section by section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=892.36s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're going to have the chair of each committee, if they're present, do an overview of the papers in their committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=901.202s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They can give a status update, they can give the highlight reel, just a brief overview of what's being worked on and any future plans to take up papers in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=912.574s">[Kit Collins]</a>: committee your next steps for papers that have been worked on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=915.196s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I will ask my fellow Councilors to try not to take more than three or four minutes, five at the most, to go over the works in your committee so that we can all center around a general update across all committees and have a brief discussion at the end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=932.748s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Since President Bears will be joining us a little bit later on the meeting, I'm going to start three sections down with the education and culture<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=942.608s">[Kit Collins]</a>: committee, and then we can go clockwise from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=946.63s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The chair of the Education and Culture Committee is Councilor Scarpelli, who I believe has to be absent tonight, reviewing the table of contents for this section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=957.474s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There were no major projects yet proposed in this committee, none of this draft, as with all of the other<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=967.475s">[Kit Collins]</a>: City Council committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=970.797s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There are relevant city ordinances and regulations that are assigned to this committee, which it can sort of, you know, if there's free time that the committee has or it doesn't have an active legislative project, it can be reviewing those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=982.165s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do not believe that the Education and Culture Committee has met yet to do any of this kind of maintenance work in order to take up any legislative projects so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=991.351s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we'll proceed to the Governance Committee, chaired by Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1153.971s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1160.576s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We will proceed next to the planning and permitting committee of which I am the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1168.742s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So the update on this committee, I'll try to be brief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1172.025s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is the committee that meets most often, been meeting twice a month since I believe February.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1179.214s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Our major project, our most major project is zoning reform, which the Council has been working towards for longer than I have been on City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1190.559s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The City Council completed a phase one of recodification at the very beginning of my first term dealing with tweaks and cleanups to the zoning code.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1199.363s">[Kit Collins]</a>: building code that were recommended by Attorney Bob Roski and city staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1204.164s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Paper 24-033 represents phase two of our zoning reevaluation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1210.686s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The city council secured funding for a zoning consultant in 2022 and 2023, and that, with the help of the Planning, Development, and Sustainability Department, is manifesting in our contract with Innes Associates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1224.83s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have been meeting with them at least monthly since March,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1229.171s">[Kit Collins]</a>: on a work plan to overhaul the city zoning and bring it into alignment with the comprehensive plan, the housing production plan, and the climate action and adaptation plan, which were created collaboratively<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1243.188s">[Kit Collins]</a>: between city staff, the city council, and residents over the past several years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1247.791s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we've gotten through kind of the initial tweaks, definitions, streamlining, kind of low-hanging fruit aspect of that process with the first package of zoning amendments that we passed earlier this month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1263.542s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And our next batch of work, I believe, is around using the mapping analysis, which was just completed by Innes Associates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1269.926s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We reviewed it last night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1271.363s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to develop a global approach to zoning changes, things that we want to see throughout the entire community and also neighborhood by neighborhood, district by district, corridor by corridor changes to bring smaller areas of the city into alignment with what residents want guided by those plans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1289.272s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that is the, I think, most major project of this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1293.974s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There are other ordinance projects that go along with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1297.776s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For example, transportation demand management<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1300.444s">[Kit Collins]</a>: proposed by Councilors Leming and Tseng, which also comes from the Climate Action Adaptation Plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1306.106s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know this has been brought up to city staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1308.687s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There are other proposals in this committee, which have not yet been taken up at a super granular level, such as Green Score, which also has to do with the building code and making new developments more energy efficient and holding developers in Medford to a better environmental standard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1331.587s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This ordinance under the ordinances section, the condo conversion ordinance was recently subsumed into the zoning overhaul bucket of work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1339.996s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This aligns with our affordable housing goals that are very prominent in the goals of the zoning<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1348.487s">[Kit Collins]</a>: revaluation that we're doing so will be pursuing the condo conversion ordinance which was begun in 2022 within the context of the zoning overhaul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1357.293s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This committee is also where we have referred several housing home rule petitions, including rent stabilization we held one meeting on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1364.182s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm the sponsor of that paper, I don't plan for us to meet on that until at least the fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1369.187s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We also referred into this committee the housing home rule petition around the real estate transfer fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1376.574s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The future of this local option at the State House is looking uncertain, I would say bleak, and so I think it's a discussion that I would like to have with my fellow councilors, what the fate of that home rule petition should be in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1392.449s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There are several other projects in this committee, including reviewing the fee schedule, which we have already begun, making sure that our administrative fees are brought into alignment with best practices from other neighboring committees to make sure that we're not charging way, way less than other communities are charging for things like marriage licenses, dog licenses, vehicles, just making sure that we're keeping up with best practices and updating things that haven't been updated in a very long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1416.527s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The cycling safety ordinance, this has not been formally proposed yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1421.092s">[Kit Collins]</a>: idea that I would like to put forward later in the term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1423.154s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know that our PDS department has already kind of included the goals of a cycling safety ordinance into our existing complete streets set of goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1434.263s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Finally, some proposals that have not yet been formally introduced that have to do with energy efficiency for new and existing buildings, energy disclosure, the benchmarking ordinance,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1444.93s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And finally the rental ice licensing ordinance also needs to be given a paper numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1449.092s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This was proposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1450.953s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In March of this year we have not yet had a meeting on a specific proposal for the ordinance itself in this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1459.537s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Finally pesticide regulations and the blasting earth removal regulations these are 2 of the ordinance projects that we have not yet met on to go over language and perhaps they are things that will meet on later in the term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1471.982s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If our other priorities left for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1476.055s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also want to note that the Licensing, Permitting, and Signs Subcommittee exists within this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1481.297s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli is the chair of this subcommittee, and he has held meetings with certain signs appeal applicants so far in the term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1495.384s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that brings us to the Public Health and Community Safety Committee, which is chaired by Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1617.677s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is the February 2024 version, so yes, it's not up to date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1726.309s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Chair Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1731.633s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just to reinforce, you know, I think that was an<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1737.486s">[Kit Collins]</a>: exceptional highlight reel of some of the work done so far in this committee and reconciling those headlines with the list of topics in the governing agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1748.85s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's even more that has been referred into that committee that we have met on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1754.652s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've been holding more committee meetings this year than ever before by quite a large magnitude.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1760.695s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I see President Bears has raised his hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1763.716s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go ahead, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1765.454s">[Kit Collins]</a>: or I'll unmute you, then I'm glad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1767.416s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this is my co-host.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1787.21s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1788.171s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're just going in order of the governing agenda right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1790.493s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I thought we could come back to those right at the end and end on a high note.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1798.311s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Next, we come to the Public Works and Facilities Committee, chaired by Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1819.887s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Not in the chambers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1961.119s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Councilor Callahan, really appreciate that overview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1969.591s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Next, we will go to Councilor Leming for an overview of the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2249.462s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We will go back to the beginning of our document, and we can loop back to projects in committee of the whole, and then the administration and finance committee, and I believe President Bears is going to present on both of these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2265.01s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears, I can relinquish screen sharing if you would prefer to do it yourself, or if that's not additive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2748.749s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much President Bears for presenting on projects and committee of the whole and the administration and finance committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2755.54s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Before we go to general comment, I also want to extend a note of gratitude to all of my fellow Councilors, including those who couldn't be here tonight for helming such productive committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2767.508s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I said it earlier in the meeting that this is far and away the busiest council that certainly that I've been on, but also that I've observed as a constituent and especially to new Councilors who are just joining this term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2781.297s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I really want to applaud you for diving into your first year of service and leading<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2785.98s">[Kit Collins]</a>: on major legislative projects in committee, meeting regularly, pushing things forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2790.665s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And of course, these are not ideas that simply come out of the clear blue sky.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2795.049s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These are projects that residents have been asking for, sometimes for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2798.772s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These are things pulled from our comprehensive plans, our comment plans, our housing plans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2802.775s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These are things that have come from city staff and the constituents that we know would make Medford a better place to live, to work, to raise a family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2811.621s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and I'm very grateful to this council for working together to have the most productive and collaborative term that we possibly can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2818.554s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2862.982s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears on the motion by President Bears, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2869.424s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Madam Clerk, just let me know whenever you're ready.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2898.463s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Six in favor one absent the motion for all committee chairs to submit updates to the President and Vice President and for the President and Vice President to accordingly update the governing agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2909.574s">[Kit Collins]</a>: also pulling from the council newsletters as guides to upload to the governing agenda and include a short summary of what committees have been meeting and overall takeaways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2921.717s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2925.598s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is there any further discussion by members of the committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2929.779s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2931.96s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2934.1s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's a motion to adjourn from Councilor Lazzaro, seconded by Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2939.636s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Madam Clerk, whenever you're ready.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2950.281s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2963.086s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion passes and the meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2965.147s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you very much, everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2966.348s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Madam Clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=596.63s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=598.231s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's one thing to take a stroll through the Brooks Park, you know, by oneself or with friends or with family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=605.054s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's another to get a personal tour from Mr. Lincoln, which I was very lucky to do when I first took office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=611.177s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it really is incredible hearing that kind of layers deep history of all of the work<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=618.201s">[Kit Collins]</a>: volunteer work, community work, just layers of investment that go into making this really such a jewel in the community, the outdoor space, the historic preservation that the community gets to enjoy more and more every year as the renovation continues to go on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=632.954s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So my heartfelt thanks to Mr. Lincoln, you know, really an incredible, an incredible legacy to leave in Medford, to leave the Brooks Park estate so improved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=644.364s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1017.381s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1019.682s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sylvia, thank you so much for so many years of service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1023.164s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Congratulations on your retirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1025.845s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is really hard to imagine the clerk's office without you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1029.786s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think about the moments in my life in Medford that you have been there for when I filed for a business permit, when I pulled papers for the first time, when I took my first oath of office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1039.931s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know there's so many people doing things that really contribute to the fabric of Medford, whether it's business permits or virtual licenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1048.055s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, applying for various things in the city of Medford, they have to go through you and your colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1053.678s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And you've been such an integral part of what that experience is like, of people trying to shape their life in various ways, shape their contributions to Medford in various ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1063.885s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And what an incredible role to inhabit for so many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1067.367s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So my thanks go out to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1069.028s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think 32 years of public service really tells you a lot about a person and how they choose to live their life in service to their community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1076.474s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I wish you only the very best for a very long and happy retirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1079.917s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1309.82s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1320.661s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1366.161s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's a happy day to get to congratulate two, you know, two civil servants with such incredible longevity and a history of so many years of contribution to our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1375.043s">[Kit Collins]</a>: To be able to congratulate two on retirement in just one evening is really a happy thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1379.545s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's also a little bittersweet to say goodbye to two members, you know, two contributors to City Hall who have been so present for so many years, been of service to this council and to the community, you know, in ways personal and professional for such a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1397.25s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Janice, congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1398.47s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for your many years of hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1401.392s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for, you know, bringing not only your hard work, but your personality to this city hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1406.895s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're sad to see you go, but again, best wishes for a joyful and long retirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1412.158s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1666.04s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2221.954s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2222.674s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We want to thank you, Councilor Scarpelli, for putting this forward tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2226.755s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Of course, it's always a sad occasion when somebody with such a huge impact, you know, yet another public servant, when we have to mark their passing here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2237.377s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, and sad as it is, I'm glad for the opportunity to reflect on, you know, a person, a woman with a career that, who really ran right at challenge and the ability to do an outsized amount of good in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2250.046s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I spend my deepest condolences to her family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2352.196s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2354.337s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On June 12th, the topic of the planning and permitting committee, which was the same one as which wrapped up right before this regular meeting, we were meeting with our zoning consultant, Innes Associates, which frequent flyers have heard me give this context before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2368.046s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is the zoning consultant that the city council hired at the end of last term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2372.309s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And in many meetings of the planning and permitting committee this term, we have been working with them to create a work plan<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2378.433s">[Kit Collins]</a>: pulling from the comprehensive plan, the climate action adaptation plan, the housing production plan to consider proposed changes to the zoning ordinance to make manifest in our zoning the goals and topics that the community has placed into those plans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2394.301s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The topic of the June 12th meeting was to review the status of the mapping analysis and the topic-based work plan that will inform our future committee's work and votes over the summer and into the fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2408.595s">[Kit Collins]</a>: motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2605.299s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2605.579s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have a motion to suspend the rules to take the following papers out of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=2608.52s">[Kit Collins]</a>: 24-426, 24-418, 24-423, 24-424, and 24-436.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3806.614s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3807.914s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for putting this forward, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3809.595s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for the context, Director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3811.956s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you to so many people for joining us in the council chambers, as always.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3818.473s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I wouldn't wanna put words in Councilor Scarpelli's mouth, but when we're on the topic about how to proceed here procedurally, in the committee meeting directly before this one, in the planning and permitting committee, we were actually just discussing the issue of Salem Street Corridor as one of our zoning priorities as we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3836.081s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think that this could be just a really cohesive move to refer this paper, which as we've been discussing needs a little bit more<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3844.687s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that it needs tweaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3845.548s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a zoning issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3847.769s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've never done a zoning issue in one meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3849.91s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that that aligns very closely with the work that we were just discussing doing in the zoning committee, knowing that the rezoning of re-evaluating the zoning of Salem Street is already a priority for the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3862.158s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We were just speaking about that in the last committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3864.58s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so I think it could be, I think it could dovetail really nicely with our existing plans to take a look at Salem Street Corridor in addition to some other priority corridors in the city and say, what does our zoning allow us to do here by right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3877.964s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What does it allow us to do by a special permit, which until this permit was withdrawn, applied to this permit, what do we wanna see on these corridors and how should we update our zoning so that we get what we want and we don't have to worry about what we don't want<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3891.488s">[Kit Collins]</a>: here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3891.728s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I do want to note, I've been hearing this, you know, over and over for the past couple weeks, and I'm really heartened to hear it from so many people in the community saying, it's not that I think we shouldn't have this in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3903.97s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's just that the location has to be right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3905.65s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that something I'm really certain we all share is that, you know, we know that this is something that people need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3912.112s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a service that people need, that people in Medford need, that our neighbors need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3916.172s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We want it to be successful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3917.533s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And in order to be successful, it needs to be in the right location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3920.553s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that we can, I would love to prioritize this issue within our existing zoning work to make sure that as we're reevaluating our zoning already in progress, we're taking a look to say, where's the right spot for this use and how can we make sure that it can occur here and not in locations where it's going to be less successful and less supported by residents for understandable reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=3943.758s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6005.828s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6006.668s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for being here to present the appointees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6010.751s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's so exciting to be at the point of finally appointing trustees to the Affordable Housing Trust.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6017.035s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This project has been in the works for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6019.116s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This was first proposed by former Council President John Falco, I believe, and it was voted on in the Council's previous term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6025.58s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm so glad to reach this point where we are putting some people power to this mechanism.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6031.043s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6033.144s">[Kit Collins]</a>: really enjoyed reading over this paper over the weekend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6035.725s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, this is a crew with such an incredible list of housing and affordable housing bona fides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6041.409s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It makes me really proud to know that there are so many people like this in our community, and not just with these skills and experiences, but also willing to throw their hat in the ring and say, yes, I'll step up, I'll work hard to take on this really quite technical, detailed, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6061.212s">[Kit Collins]</a>: issue of affordable housing and doing it right in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6066.304s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's not something you to show up and volunteer for an hour and then go on your way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6069.545s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This requires volunteering, like real, real skill and thoughtfulness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6074.447s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm really happy to see all these appointees coming in with kind of an incredible level of professional experience to lend to this trust.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6082.75s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a really wonderful cohort to start off our Affordable Housing Trust with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6088.132s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for assembling these candidates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6089.792s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you all for applying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6090.673s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I will be so proud to vote in favor of all of these tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6106.057s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6340.553s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6341.413s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6342.414s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Again, it's great to see a candidate that comes to our community with a unique perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6351.203s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that will bring a unique perspective to how to leverage our CPA funds to the greatest use for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6358.731s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So pending further comment by my fellow Councilors, I would motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9660.78s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Beas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9661.941s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to thank everybody who spoke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9669.366s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that this is, you know, with any issue that we don't have consensus on, you know, lately, it seems like it's pretty easy for things to get polarized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9683.717s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When I listen to almost, not everybody, but almost everybody who's spoken on this issue at this meeting or who's emailed or called me or spoke at our last meeting, when I listen to almost all of those comments without any exception, I really do think that we all want the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9699.997s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've heard<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9701.735s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Very, very few number of people say, I actually don't want this anywhere in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9705.336s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this has no place in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9706.916s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've heard a very few number of people say that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9709.577s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I personally don't believe that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9710.998s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this has a place in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9712.778s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That doesn't mean it should go any place in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9715.699s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I agree with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9716.679s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The success of the mission depends on where we put it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9719.54s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think everybody who's come forward and said, I'm really concerned about where this was proposed to go, that's totally reasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9728.143s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If anybody's felt vilified for having that opinion, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9732.526s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would never want anybody to feel that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9735.208s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think that you should be made to feel bad for voicing your opinion about where this should go or where it's going to be most successful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9742.132s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know some people are motivated by their neighborhood concerns and other people are motivated by, I don't think this is gonna be most successful here, this doesn't make sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9750.018s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If this should go in a commercial or industrial area, why don't we have the tools currently in place to put it there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9757.136s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's actually under the jurisdiction of this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9759.617s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's what we have the power to do we've been working for a very long time, more terms that I've been on the council to get to a point where we have the resources to make those changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9767.899s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When it comes to medical offices when it comes to many other uses so we can start finally start making decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9773.641s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That could be answers to the question of why don't we have X here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9777.584s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Why don't we have Y here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9779.346s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Why doesn't Medford look more like XYZ the way I want it to, the way it used to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9783.629s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're finally amassing the resources to make those changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9788.693s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They're not fast to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9790.214s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We can't make them quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9791.915s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's too technical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9792.756s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's too detailed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9793.597s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's a very unglamorous, but I think well-known thing about government is if you do it fast, you might do it wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9799.061s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And this is too important to not get right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9804.551s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I just want to reinforce that when I hear people talk about this, I really think that we all, with some very, very few exceptions, we know that this has a place in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9813.253s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We know that we want to take excellent care of the people whose lives will be better off for having this available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9819.955s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We know that there are people in Medford who do need this available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9823.476s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We know that we should find the best possible place for this to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9826.857s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think that this shared cause is advanced by<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9832.439s">[Kit Collins]</a>: using this forum to spread disinformation, such as there being a backroom deal to bring this into or to target a residential neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9840.325s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Of course that didn't happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9842.026s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That would never happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9844.188s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's nobody's goals here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9845.309s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think this conversation is advanced by being resolute to be at war over this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9852.074s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're all on the same team here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9853.916s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If we want to be at war about this, if people in this room or people in this conversation are resolved to be at war about this,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9860.595s">[Kit Collins]</a>: we can drag this congregation down into the mud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9863.339s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's optional.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=9864.5s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that's completely, completely orthogonal to everybody's goals here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=10009.484s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I thank the administration for their diligence in reviewing applications and I motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=10781.745s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to approve pending the comment period and conditioned on the final approvals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=10838.646s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bearer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=10839.467s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, I got distracted because that was very sweet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=10842.93s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would motion to suspend the rules to take communications from the mayor and to suspend rule 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11144.283s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11145.343s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for being here and sticking with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11148.164s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't have any specific questions on the appropriation requested, but I do always appreciate an overview of where CPA funding comes from, the very strict rules regulating what it may be spent on and in what proportion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11161.59s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm glad to see that the CPC voted to increase voluntarily the amount that we're spending on community housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11166.992s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that that's a value that's shared by many in the community, and I'm sure that'll be welcome news to many.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11171.457s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So of course, all of the uses that CPA money can be spent on are, you know, we can look all around and see the benefit that they do throughout Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11179.706s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you so much for walking us through this, but I'm excited to approve this tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11505.052s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12600.569s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for being here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12602.771s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know this project has been a long time in the works, and I appreciate your overview and presentation about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12610.839s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have a general understanding about what historic designation, what implication that has and doesn't have for how those properties might be affected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12620.952s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You've spoken a little bit about how it's not an absolute prohibition on any particular material.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12625.509s">[Kit Collins]</a>: working with developers so that I know renovations still happen under historic designation, EDUs can still happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12632.134s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12634.016s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Because so much of, well, speaking for myself as one councilor, because a large part of the council's goals this term are to consider proposals that do allow us to look at tools that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12648.621s">[Kit Collins]</a>: enable different neighborhoods to evolve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12651.043s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I am, I have a healthy skepticism around tools that might make it more difficult for developers to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12661.491s">[Kit Collins]</a>: do things like, I understand there's no prohibition on adding height, on affecting footprint, but I have some concerns around adding rules that will make it less likely for developers to do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12674.458s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Have you noticed in historic districts already in place in Medford, is there indeed a lag with developers or owners taking advantage of things that are still technically available to them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12771.104s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's hard to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12811.001s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13067.014s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13072.105s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, it's getting late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13073.108s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Brain's slowing down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13076.042s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Really appreciate this discussion really appreciate this kind of formal introduction to the issue though of course we've heard glimmers of it before when this was still in process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13085.668s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that, at least for me as one Councilor I think this is a topic that you know of course there's already historic designation along South Street already, but this does mark a significant expansion in that footprint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13097.854s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think, you know, to echo some of what Councilor Scarpelli just said, I think that it seems very clear to me that for every concern or question we have, there's a ready answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13108.685s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That being, notwithstanding that being the case, you know, it's pretty rare for us to take a first vote on an ordinance when it's first introduced before the Council, and I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13119.332s">[Kit Collins]</a>: know, in the role that we inhabit on the City Council, especially with something as longstanding as an ordinance, we can feel incredible about how a current Board of Commissioners takes up their mission and implements it, and certainly I feel great about the work that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13135.763s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you all do and how you've been doing and how you've been collaborating with community members and developers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13139.727s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But this is something that marks a big enough change that I'd like to give it a bit more conversation and deliberation before we take votes on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13146.473s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I would make the motion to perhaps refer into the planning and permitting committee where we take up other building related topics for more of a discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13158.824s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to go over the details of the questions raised by councillors before we move forward, unless there's an alternative proposal raised by my fellow councillors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13488.762s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If I'm being totally candid,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13497.565s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If I'm being candid, part of the reason for my desire to have more of this discussion in a separate meeting is because we have five or six major financial papers to take up after this, and I don't want to have that conversation right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13507.29s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That said, if there's another motion to approve it outright, we just take the votes, and I wouldn't take that personally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15657.162s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15658.843s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's always helpful to have kind of a refresher on what free cash is and where it comes from, and the instability of that as a revenue source.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15675.371s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was thinking about it today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15676.351s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was thinking about different ways to articulate it, and I think this is probably an imperfect way of conceptualizing it, but I was thinking of free cash as money that we did not intend to save, and that's partly true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15686.836s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But in part, our free cash is amassed because of positions that we intended to fill and pay people salaries for that because of various reasons, we didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15697.023s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think the responsible thing to do with public resources when we intended to use it for one source and we for some reason couldn't spend it on, for example, a salary, is to use that as revenue for paying for a capital need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15714.758s">[Kit Collins]</a>: where we otherwise wouldn't be able to amass the resources to, you know, we know that we have great capital needs in the city of Medford on so many of our public buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15726.466s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I mean, I could list them, but we don't even really need to between our public buildings and our roads and sidewalks and the high school, you know, on the topic of analogies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15740.546s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We don't need more, we don't need more analogies tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15743.587s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think what's what's what feels like a central fact to me in making any decision about where to appropriate a free cash is that, you know, to rephrase, it's in no way a sustainable or predictable revenue source I think that we can certainly expect to responsibly to have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15762.755s">[Kit Collins]</a>: less free cash certified at the end of this fiscal year than we did at the end of this one, because a lot of those areas where we weren't spending as much as we were budgeting in FY 24, I know the administration worked really hard to get those out of the budget so that we could make the most use of every dollar that we are budgeting for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15779.719s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think it's incredibly irresponsible to spend funds that have a really clear<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15787.0s">[Kit Collins]</a>: floor at the bottom of that bank account on needs that are not going away because they're part of our operating budget and they pay for the school experience and pay for teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15797.142s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Because what are we going to do when that money is gone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15799.462s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's not a sustainable revenue source.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15802.163s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But then I'm getting onto a future topic here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15805.063s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On the topic of the MSBA feasibility study, and we're talking about transparent government and, you know, leading in a way that manifests the will of the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15814.765s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15816.445s">[Kit Collins]</a>: better, safer, more vibrant, more appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15818.826s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Medford High School is something that so many people in the community have been crying out for for such a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15823.908s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And this appropriation is a necessary step in the process of maintaining our eligibility for getting the funding that could get us there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15832.811s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so this vote is crucial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15834.191s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think this is an unambiguously good use for this $3 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15837.993s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'll motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16825.328s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Pierce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16831.988s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to preface by saying I haven't always been fully, in the past, I haven't felt fully comfortable with the volume of free cash that the city has amassed, but I think that this type of plan really puts data to the intuition that there's things, important, unskippable projects that this money is being saved and appropriated for, things that we do not have other sustainable ways of funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16858.757s">[Kit Collins]</a>: whether it's, you know, fleet replacements in the fire department, stabilization funds, which are essentially, you know, a piggy bank for the city in the same way that a person or a household has a savings bank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16870.306s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Communities need them for the same reasons of responding to emergencies responsibly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16878.251s">[Kit Collins]</a>: liabilities for pensions and insurance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16881.713s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's really helpful to have a draft of this plan for how this, you know, you just look at the number 25 million, 34 million now, you think, wow, that's a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16890.976s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Like, why, what are we sitting on that for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16893.117s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think it's so important to have a draft plan for how it's going to be appropriated, because that number gets whittled down very, very quickly when we take stock of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16903.1s">[Kit Collins]</a>: stabilization funds that we ought to get in line with best practices in terms of how much we are saving for those rainy days and emergencies and for the major operating capital expenses that we need funding for that we're not going to fund out of our operating budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16918.243s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think that this is a great start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16920.624s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm very happy to approve this tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16923.324s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would also want to put forward a B paper to schedule a committee of the whole to discuss the free cash plan in more detail with the council and with the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17939.292s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17940.013s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for presenting on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17941.935s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm heartened to hear that the school committee already took a vote to approve this, not just because that's a step towards manifesting it, but also, you know, I would look to them to get the body's opinion on if this is a worthwhile endeavor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17954.407s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it means a lot to me that the school committee, you know, the majority of them thought that this was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17960.239s">[Kit Collins]</a>: worth moving forward and, you know, this does not, in my understanding, passage of this does not automatically, of course, it doesn't automatically consolidate any functions between the city and the schools department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17972.602s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What it does is it allows us to have those discussions about what functions might be advantageous to consolidate, might help us<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17980.684s">[Kit Collins]</a>: streamline things that both the cities and Metro Public Schools are doing might help us save money on things that we're currently doing in two places, would allow us to have those discussions and then be able to act on them if we come to decisions that some departments are worth combining.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17995.467s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I will be happy to approve this tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=17998.048s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18098.892s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18306.547s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18307.308s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for walking us through these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18308.869s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't have any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18309.99s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know from my two previous budget years, this is a standard, you know, set of loose threads to tie up at the end of the fiscal year, just to transfer unspent funds to other departments where there were additional funds that were budgeted for and balance things out that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18328.186s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'd be happy to, motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18722.383s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18723.303s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for the presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18724.604s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm happy to see this before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18728.246s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I am always pleased for the opportunity to give any member of city personnel a raise, no matter whether they are union or non-union.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18738.37s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that everybody deserves raises.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18739.811s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Everybody deserves cost of living adjustments, and it's not a zero-sum situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18744.813s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm always happy to approve raises.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18749.154s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would motion to approve the amendment put forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18753.256s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would motion to exclude CAF 22, the mayor's position from the COLA afforded to non-use and personnel between 2021 and 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18764.881s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But beyond that, that is the only exclusion I would make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18791.913s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I need a correction, that excluding CAF 22 only from the raises made between 2021 and 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18796.637s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That this is only proposing January 1 and July 1, 2024?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18812.111s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think maybe I'm confused by the wording.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18823.08s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This amendment makes no changes to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18831.067s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Cap changes made prior to 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18852.683s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, I would like to amend my motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=18854.844s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would like to approve the amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=560.862s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There'll be a meeting of the Planning and Permanent Committee, June 25, 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=564.803s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This meeting will take place at 6 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=566.404s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in the City Council Chamber, second floor, Medford City Hall, 85 George B. Hassett Drive, Medford MA, and via Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=574.406s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Madam Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=607.186s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I've never had to say before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=612.447s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For present, one absent, the meeting is called to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=616.88s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Action and discussion items 24033 offered by President Bears and Vice President Collins, zoning ordinance updates with the Innes Associates team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=627.643s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for being here again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=629.864s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know the member says number five, this feels like definitely more than six or seven meetings we've had on this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=634.625s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're gonna be meeting many more times this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=636.666s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you as always for being with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=639.147s">[Kit Collins]</a>: At our last committee meeting with our zoning consultant on June 12th,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=644.889s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We talked about the status of the mapping analysis, we talked about the status of the work plan, organizing the various goals and topics from our climate action and adaptation plan and our comprehensive plan, turning those into a work plan that's full of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=658.045s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Council and city staff and community initiatives into topics that can be broken down then into actual language changes to apply to our code of zoning ordinances to bring Medford zoning more in line with what the community has been articulating that it really wants over the past few years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=675.215s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So the agenda for today is to review that more comprehensive work plan of all of those goals and topics into something that the Council<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=684.335s">[Kit Collins]</a>: can take action on in coming months with a focus on what we'll work on over the next couple months and view the status of the mapping analysis that we got a little preview of on the 12th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=694.186s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are there any preliminary comments from my fellow Councilors before we turn it over to Innes Associates?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=702.015s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing none, take it away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=907.016s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=907.837s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for the introduction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=910.439s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Paola, looking forward to seeing these a bit more in depth and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=914.21s">[Kit Collins]</a>: mentioned this to Emily before the meeting, we are working on under a bit of a time crunch today because the regular meeting a bit after 7pm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=920.876s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So if we could try to keep this section of the meeting to 20 or 30 minutes, that would be ideal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=925.841s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we can keep things moving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=926.842s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1401.734s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1402.874s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll go first to President Bears and then to Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1475.66s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1599.87s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1601.431s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll echo that last comment specifically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1603.192s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I really love a Gantt chart and that's certainly the most prodigious one I've seen so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1606.954s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I really appreciate the granular level of detail because as President Bears said, I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1613.055s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This data visualization, you know, it puts into sharp relief, how many issues and topics and goals we're trying to work on really in the span of exactly one fiscal year now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1621.901s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So knowing exactly where we are in that process will be critical to accomplishing as much of this as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1629.026s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just some quick reactions from me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1631.519s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know at this time, I'm really heartened to hear of the priority list that we've drafted and of course all of this is going to shift and evolve as projects tend to do over the next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1642.995s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But it's been clear to me from our previous conversations in this committee and hearing feedback from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1647.188s">[Kit Collins]</a>: City staff and of course from the community that, you know, that Mystic F corridor is one of the areas of the city that I hear the most about from just regular average people when it comes to why is this the way that it is and what are we going to do to make it what we really want there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1662.647s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Same for Salem corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1665.149s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think it's really right that we're thinking about how to approach that geography first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1671.413s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And in reviewing that kind of off the cuff list of priorities from Councilors at our previous committee meeting on the 12th, I know we all agreed that each one of these topics is urgent and critical, but that doing what we can around affordable housing, really implementing what we've already resolved to do around affordable housing absolutely has to come first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1690.842s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I am,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1692.778s">[Kit Collins]</a>: excited to address those starting in the summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1698.025s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just to interrupt myself very quickly, Councilor Callahan on Zoom requests if we could focus the Zoom on the left portion of the chart again before we take that down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1711.93s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just lastly, I'm really glad that Councilor Scarpelli brought up the note about public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1717.375s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know with these public meetings, we're always thinking about how to make sure that there are more people in the room and more people know about them, especially when it comes to things affecting people in their own neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1725.521s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also think it could be meaningful since so many of these zoning goals came out of the community input process informing the comprehensive plan and the climate action adaptation plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1734.188s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's where these goals come from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1735.85s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it could be meaningful if it's possible to dig up any of those old, like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1739.07s">[Kit Collins]</a>: public participation worksheets from those months of sessions just to kind of illustrate here's where some of these goals came from here's what residents have already in a sense voted for like here's the why behind some of these proposals and then we can add an additional testimony on top of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1838.878s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1840.919s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was thinking that there was multiple packages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=1864.14s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One second, Jimmy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=2695.851s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Director Hunt, before I recognize President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=2697.952s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll note, I think that that's a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=2699.914s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's a ton to digest from these maps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=2702.956s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for that overview, Jimmy and Emily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=2706.338s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Some of these are really quite amazing to see this data laid out visually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=2712.362s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I would love to see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=2713.362s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think maybe we can look at a date that would work for this committee, in addition to our already scheduled July meeting for this group, so that we can continue to move ahead on proposed<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=2723.257s">[Kit Collins]</a>: discussing proposals, either from the, you know, perhaps that'll, I don't think that we really want to push back our first meeting about the corridor level zoning, but I think that this would be fantastic to wrap our head around the kind of global approach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=2737.442s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it's been a long time since we had a meeting where we all just stand around a table together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=2741.524s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think that'll be very useful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=2744.405s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=2847.261s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Paris and Jimmy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=2848.783s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I see Attorney Silverstein's hand raised on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=2852.125s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Please go ahead and state your name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=2882.776s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you very much, Attorney Silverstein.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=2887.157s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this has been, I think, a helpful overview of the main guide and the main set of tools that we'll be using over the summer and beyond to set some of these goals and topic areas in motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=2900.32s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Using the work plan to keep ourselves apace on the many goals called from, you know, years of community outreach into the comp plan and the climate plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=2909.409s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and discussing ways to make those manifest and changes to our zoning code, whether that be on the basis of topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=2916.963s">[Kit Collins]</a>: addressing specific corridors, specific districts or global approaches.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=2921.147s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then to be guided by this new suite of maps, which give us many overlapping pieces of insight into what we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=2928.853s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're talking about different areas of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=2931.895s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And this plan for our next steps in terms of next month, sound good to me as one Councilor, we already have a meeting on the books with this committee and the zoning consultant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=2942.862s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and it sounds like there's consensus around using that to begin our conversation around potential proposals for the Salem Street corridor and the Mystic Ave corridor, two priority areas for the community and the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=2955.453s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think it'd be really advantageous to, I don't know the July date off the top of my head, but if it's possible to even to fit in that map meeting before that, so we can have that in our heads as we go forward to think about all the other goals and topics with those layers in mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=2970.424s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that would set us off on the right foot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=2972.486s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any other councilor Reming?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=3012.059s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=3013.161s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And likewise, I know that the work plan is too physically large to put in the council packets this week, but if that could be distributed to members of this committee as well, that would be very helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=3028.182s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Paula.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=3030.515s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well, at our previous meeting, we were reviewing the work plan just in draft before it was reformatted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=3034.859s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know Councilors had a chance to review everything that was included within it to make sure that, you know, all key priorities and suggestions from individual Councilors and residents via Councilors had been included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=3047.068s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I took another pass today at the work plan that we received on Friday, and I know that all of my pet projects were in there for myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=3054.293s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that was, I know that I'm sure that additional projects and topics will get added as we work through this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=3059.957s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And certainly it doesn't need to be any longer than it already is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=3065.902s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think that we are starting to get to a place where we can be picking up that pipeline that we kind of test drove with site plan review and definitions and municipal exemptions in May, where we can be working on this kind of two track approach of reviewing proposals to corridors and global strategies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=3088.843s">[Kit Collins]</a>: figuring out a cadence to be reviewing proposed language to get at those topics and goals from NS Associates that are in line with the goals and priorities that we agree on, discussing them, voting them out of committee, and making sure that we are, you know, as best we can, going in order of priority and also going in order of actionability when we're ready to move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=3106.833s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we know that it's urgent to move on so that we can make sure our zoning reflects what we want for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=3115.094s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that takes us to the end of our formal agenda for tonight, because I know we wanted to mostly get a preview of these tools and guidelines we'll be working with for the rest of the summer and the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=3124.258s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are there any last questions from Councilors on the mapping analysis, the work plan, or on what to expect from our next steps in July?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=3137.003s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing none, is there any comment from city staff or any member of the public who wish to speak?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=3146.783s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If you'd like to speak and come up to the microphone and state your name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=3149.964s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's okay, just name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=3178.502s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any other further comment from members of the public, city staff, councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=3187.166s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well, thank you so much for being here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=3188.626s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for all your work that's gotten us to this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-vjCj0xS-sU&t=3190.667s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Looking forward to July and we'll work together to schedule that working meeting around the maps as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=11.828s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=13.93s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Four present, one absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=16.171s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The meeting is called to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=18.873s">[Kit Collins]</a>: At this meeting, we will again revisit paper 24033, offered by President Bears and Vice President Collins, zoning ordinance updates with the Innes Associates team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=32.857s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The agenda says this is the fourth Zoning Updates meeting with Innes Associates, but I think the actual number is higher than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=38.959s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For this meeting, we have agreed on the following agenda, to look at priority zoning recommendations from the Climate Adaptation and Action Plan, to prioritize zoning recommendations from the 2023 Comprehensive Plan, discussing completing the mapping analysis by June 30, and to discuss new topics that came up during the May 8 committee meeting that should be added to our work plan,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=61.475s">[Kit Collins]</a>: including legal definitions and formatting and permitting and process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=70.284s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Given that, that's a lot to discuss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=72.506s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that NS Associates has prepared a memo with a first draft of pulling those zoning recommendations from the comp plan and the climate adaptation and action plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=82.195s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So there's a lot to potentially go over in that already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=87.446s">[Kit Collins]</a>: speaking as one councilor, speaking as the chair, I think my ideal goals for this meeting are to do an overview of the existing recommendations that Innes Associates has already pulled from the cap and the comp plan, to have a discussion on that with councilors towards the goal of at our next committee meeting on June 26, making sure that councilors, Innis and staff all feel comfortable that all of the recommendations that should be pulled from the climate action and adaptation plan and the comp plan<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=117.145s">[Kit Collins]</a>: have been fully culled, they're all in our work plan, and that we've also talked about assigning priority levels to those zoning recommendations so that we can enter into the new fiscal year feeling like our source documents have been properly vetted and that way we can just approach things by topic and by neighborhood from there on out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=136.691s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'd also love for us to have a discussion about kind of how we can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=142.179s">[Kit Collins]</a>: codifying, putting legal definitions in format, permitting and process into the work timeline to make sure that gets baked in, and then discussing what we need to do to make sure that the mapping analysis, which I think is in a draft stage, will be completed and ready for review at the June 26th committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=160.815s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Before we get started with reviewing, I want to pass it off to NS Associates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=165.94s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any preliminary comments from Councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=235.498s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, president bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=236.418s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=237.338s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it'd be great to publish that well in advance so that residents have lots of lead time to know when changes that might affect their neighborhood are coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=244.94s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, and I think it would be a great segue to, I think it could be a great segue to complete this categorization<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=252.875s">[Kit Collins]</a>: pulling from the cap and the comp plan and making sure that we've been thorough and comprehensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=257.879s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It seems to me that we might be able to solidify the work plan for the global and the district changes once we kind of have the full scope of what we're looking at and how those might file in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=270.009s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any preliminary comments from city staff before I turn it over to Ines Associates?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=280.197s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well, I'll turn it over to Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=282.799s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And, um, I was thinking open to alternative ideas on this, but knowing that we have, uh, reviewing the, um, the memo that was circulated to Councilors last week with that draft of, uh, Zona recommendations pulled from the cap and the comp plan, um, there's quite a lot to discuss in there so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=303.37s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that we'd probably all appreciate adjourning no later than eight 30.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=307.256s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So to me, I think that our time could be best served doing kind of a general overview, not going through things necessarily in great detail line by line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=316.001s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I know that my priority is making sure that everything that ought to be on that list is and working on assigning a priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=324.206s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So if we could kind of do a high level overview of what's currently in that memo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=329.798s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Paola, and if you could speak to, you know, if there's anything that you particularly think ought to be flagged, anything that didn't make it in, and why I think that that might be most helpful for starting us out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=385.475s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think the plan sounds great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=767.54s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll go first to President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=900.957s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, Paula.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=901.457s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, just to jump in quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=902.778s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's a great place to start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=905.8s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And as I'm looking through this, you know, I think my priorities for the 26th is, and if we, if there's a way to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=913.547s">[Kit Collins]</a>: have this reflected in the updated table, if we can kind of be in a process of over the next two weeks, kind of as much as possible, disaggregating the zoning goals with the specific zoning strategies, or replacing some of the goals with specific strategies to achieve them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=931.815s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think how you have it laid out for today is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=933.836s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I hope that, you know, through our discussion and revision over the next couple of weeks, it can be, you know, kind of more like left column,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=940.925s">[Kit Collins]</a>: goal that this recommendation is pointing to, column next to that, here are the specific zoning changes that would get us closer to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=947.929s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I believe the bolded headings right now are, for the most part, the goals that have specific strategies attached to them at the moment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=959.815s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Should we start there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=960.735s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And Paolo, was it your intention that we would kind of start there and we could also be talking about prioritization as we're going through those strategies?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=970.523s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Director Hunt, I want to recognize you if you had a comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=972.845s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I might have missed your hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1068.243s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, thank you, Director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1069.804s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know, I think that's, you more eloquently put the point I was trying to make just now, which is right now we have the goals and some strategies to achieve them in the same column.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1078.308s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's totally fine for a first draft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1080.322s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think that it's important for the, you know, comprehensive and updated version that we look at in a couple weeks that we separate the actual strategy that's being recommended of this body from what's the point of this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1093.155s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Why are we doing this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1094.176s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What goal does it relate to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1095.237s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And what topic does that goal fit within?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1098.641s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Maybe it's a matter of just a column getting added if we have number<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1103.544s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sarah Silver, PB): Goal and then recommended zoning related action or something along those lines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1107.89s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But right now, I think it's confusing to have goals and strategies aggregated together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1183.646s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So, yeah, 100%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1184.687s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that I'm feeling similarly, you know, I think it's this is necessary runway up to getting to the point where we're taking votes on strategies that get us there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1193.289s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But we're here to take votes on the strategies that will allow us to actually to actually reduce the zoning barriers to multifamily and mixed use housing development, for example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1203.17s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, so, you know, just to restate as one Councilor, my priority is to make sure that every, every, every strategy that has been put into the cap and the comp plan so far as a change that we could vote on and make that would achieve these goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1218.7s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to make sure that that's in this table or an updated version of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1222.262s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, so that, you know, at the beginning of July, what we have is a list is essentially a to do list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1228.84s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, so I think for today, you know, I think all of this aligns with what you were talking about is making sure that discussing what's here, if there's any flags that are raised from Councilors are the things that strategies that are in here that are confusing or strategies that aren't in here that we think should be, um, and to work on, you know, assigning perhaps a priority level to the strategies that are already inside as a bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1518.414s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1519.635s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1520.275s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1520.435s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think I would co-sign those priorities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1524.018s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, but in terms of our strategy for today, um, you know, I think we're all eager to get, put some,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1533.865s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to successfully get through the part of the process we're figuring out how to fit these goals on the page in a way that makes our work easier so that we can proceed along to the point where we're actually discussing the material changes that are being recommended to achieve the goals that are being articulated in the updated version of the spreadsheet or any others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1553.579s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it made me think about the flowchart or spreadsheet that's in the implementation section of the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan itself, which<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1562.941s">[Kit Collins]</a>: always stuck with me because I found it so readable and useful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1568.104s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And maybe I think what we're talking about is like a one step more granular version of that, where right now, like that has... I think that's exactly what I was just looking at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1581.25s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, no, I mean, that's what's been sticking in my brain because that implementation matrix is so useful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1585.593s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I can bring it up if you give me a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1588.494s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's an implementation matrix at the back of the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1594.564s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I can bring that up unless somebody has it at their fingertips.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1605.209s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1605.649s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I guarantee I am trying as hard as I possibly can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1613.893s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's why it's so frustrating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1625.779s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're going to make a supplemental appropriation for a little Barbie mic for me so that people can hear me for the first time ever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1632.863s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Hang on one sec.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1633.463s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm going to pull up the CAP plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1791.188s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1793.749s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I really appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1800.226s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1801.448s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No, I think that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1803.352s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just since we're talking about it really quickly, I'm going to share my screen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1813.246s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this is not as useful as I thought it would be because the version of the cap that's on the city website has the way that two page view works is it's just flipped.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1821.872s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So what's on the left should be on the right, but I think this gives an idea at least of, you know, this kind of stepping down towards granularity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1834.441s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What's the word I'm looking for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1836.823s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Visual layout that we're looking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1838.72s">[Kit Collins]</a>: or at least that I'm kind of thinking of, of starting with the goal and then saying within this, you know, and maybe what I mean by making this more granular is instead of here having strategy and action is having, you know, replacing that action with the specific zoning change that's recommended to achieve that goal or that strategy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1859.774s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just, I just wanted to provide a visual guide for what I was, what we were describing earlier since we were talking about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1866.359s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And again, sorry that this page is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1868.962s">[Kit Collins]</a>: flipped, but I think this gives you a better idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1871.424s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Another thing that I like about this, just in terms of a template, I think it's helpful to have a snapshot of a timeline over which, as we get into strategies that will require more research, more neighborhood meetings, I think it would be great to have a snapshot of the time that we might need to take on those strategies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1898.948s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and like other benchmarks kind of in the same spreadsheet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1904.733s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And Paola, you mentioned that maybe for next time as we pursue all the updates that we've discussed so far in the updated version of the spreadsheet, I think it would be great to have a link to where specifically in the zoning that update or addition might occur as we get into specific strategies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1926.13s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that that would be really helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1928.191s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I really appreciate you, you know, trying to pace us into this and I speaking for probably not only myself, I know that we're all really eager to get through the phase of visioning and talking about strategies and getting into the nitty gritty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1941.556s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you for not throwing us into the deep end, but as one Councilor, I'm eager to be thrown into the deep end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1948.999s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Should we return to kind of a conversation of prioritization at this point, I'll make sure at the end that we're kind of all clear on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1955.546s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the updates to the spreadsheet that we wanna see for next time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1959.447s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2287.094s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Before I recognize President Bears, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2289.556s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this is a very creative way to do this exercise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2292.678s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just my first instinct is I'm kind of of two minds on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2297.342s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this is an exercise we could do synchronously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2299.544s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this is something that Councilors could do asynchronously as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2309.815s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that there also could be value in kind of going through a row and discussing that to kind of make sure that we're aligned on rating systems and then making sure that additional feedback is sent back to Innocence City staff on a reasonable timeline over the next week, perhaps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2328.467s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In any case, I do just want to acknowledge that we also want to talk about the status of the mapping analysis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2336.032s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2338.328s">[Kit Collins]</a>: tonight and it's 7.45.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2339.269s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So if we are going to have a conversation about prioritization, I just think that we should probably try to keep that to no more than 30 minutes to make sure that we get through the rest of our agenda and have time to get solid on our plan for June 26th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2352.456s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sorry, Councilor Leming, you are next and then President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2611.135s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2611.575s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And if I could just jump in and then I'll recognize you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2616.978s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that because the goals and topics that we're talking about are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2622.284s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In one sense, they're things that we're constantly talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2624.326s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think, you know, for many of us, that's why we're in office, because we want these goals to be achieved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2628.769s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think we're all completely aligned that these are, all of these are high priority in terms of creating a prioritization system that will help NS Associates, you know, know in what orders we present things to us and to city staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2645.388s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The more I think about it, I think it could be a productive thing for us to do in between committee meetings, perhaps over the next week so that NS has enough time to digest it before our next committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2654.394s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think, you know, for myself, one way I might approach this in terms of what would I really want to be high on the priority list would be either things that are most achievable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2663.544s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let's get it done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2665.084s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that Councilors might have, you know, we could look at priorities at the topic level or just at the specific strategy level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2671.566s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And some topics might be high priority because the strategies that go along with them are high priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2678.287s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But, you know, knowing that this issue of priority topics is something that we think about, you know, so constantly, I would be inclined to, you know, focus our thinking on, you know, what information and what format is in us,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2692.239s">[Kit Collins]</a>: most need to be able to, you know, put together a functioning helpful work plan from us so that we can hasten to that part where we're kind of looking at specific zoning strategies and seeing where in the zoning court that lines up with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2707.504s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So, you know, eager to hear other Councilors perspectives on this, but I think it might be productive over the next week if Councilors can, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2715.572s">[Kit Collins]</a>: kind of do a look back through the topics and the goals that we're thinking about and writing about and emailing constituents about all the time and say, you know, here's my ranking or here are the strategies that I think really have to be in the first three months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2730.384s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I am pretty confident there'll be a lot of alignment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2735.468s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2748.308s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sorry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2753.329s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No, no, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2755.99s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No, I just, I just meant like, as a way for councillors to say, this is what feels most urgent to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2818.889s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2819.069s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that, you know, kind of by the same token, because this is topics that we're constantly immersed in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2825.311s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think that we need a lot of time to digest these topics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2830.112s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So for us to be doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2931.66s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, if I could step us back for a second, Paola, could you recenter us on what, from your perspective for your work plan after tonight, what the utility of our prioritization is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2944.449s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Like, is that to put that in order of what you present to us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2948.055s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Like, you know, say that we order it, number one, housing, number two, business development, number three, climate resiliency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2954.46s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What does that influence?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2955.441s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Does that influence, okay, we're gonna package up all of the recommended zoning strategies for the committee in July, and then in August, we'll do the next one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2963.408s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Like what's the causal relationship between the prioritization and what we do next?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3092.192s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm just going to cut you off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3097.439s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Callahan has had her hand raised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3099.021s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3145.66s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go ahead, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3482.033s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3486.155s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thinking about a path forward here, it strikes me that there might be a way to thread the needle here where we're giving a little bit more exposition during this committee meeting and the time that we have left.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3501.902s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And maybe we could go round the horn and have the Councilors give a top level<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3510.8s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And again, I think like maybe the word prioritization is like was throwing us off a little bit at the beginning of the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3516.185s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But again, it's not about like what what are we not doing, but rather like what's very important to do first and thinking about prioritization at the same time as we're thinking about pairing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3526.573s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What does it make sense to do first with urgency?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3528.735s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What does it make sense to do together?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3530.649s">[Kit Collins]</a>: knowing that we're not going to be considering any of these strategies in a vacuum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3534.611s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think we could possibly take 10 minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3537.013s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Maybe Jimmy is just working on the mirror board in the background.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3540.274s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we could go around and have Councilors kind of give their impressions, you know, again, and I don't really think this counts as off the top of our head because these are goals that we think about constantly as we're doing city business, you know, to give some impressions of if it's not the full one through five, but what's my one and two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3557.284s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We could just go around to take two minutes each and do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3560.087s">[Kit Collins]</a>: councilors felt more comfortable, we could, you know, spend 15 minutes on the mapping analysis to make sure we're in good shape to have a complete version of that submitted to us ahead of the June 26 meeting, and then we can come back and do two or three minutes each per councilor on the prioritization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3577.438s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that's just one proposal for me, is to go around and leave NS Associates with just a little bit of feedback from each of us before the end of this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3585.483s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll recognize Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3629.959s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Certainly, I think that what I was proposing was a very explicitly pared down version of, I think certainly I could talk for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3636.909s">[Kit Collins]</a>: an hour about the topics before us, but I think if we wanted to entertain the idea of saying, everybody has one minute, everybody has 90 seconds, everybody has two minutes, you don't have to say you're one through five, you can just say you're number one and number two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3649.178s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then certainly, you know, Councilors are always welcome and encouraged to submit further feedback and ideas to NS Associates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3657.605s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So me as chair at any time, we could certainly follow up with additional context over the next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3661.608s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we kind of have, let's decide on a path forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3668.012s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think I see one vote for taking a minute or two each.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3673.195s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3686.943s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that we should step away from this for 20 minutes and talk about the mapping analysis, because that's another very big piece that we haven't talked about yet to make sure that we have adequate time for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3696.394s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then if we're left with five minutes, we can spend five minutes talking about our priorities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3711.926s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3716.49s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Paola, if you could circulate that by email, if you could send it to me and President Bearson, or President Bearson, the clerk,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3769.207s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just let us know when you're sorted, Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3773.669s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3775.57s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3776.271s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, and we'll try to revisit that in 15 or 20 minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3781.802s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let's go now to the mapping analysis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3784.443s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for preparing this memo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3788.323s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3788.903s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So my understanding is on June 26, the intent is to have these lists and bullet points manifested in an actual series of maps for us to review that, you know, demonstrate the analyses that will guide us as we do our, implement our global and district-wide<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3811.098s">[Kit Collins]</a>: zoning change strategies throughout the rest of this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3813.44s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But Paola, can you just give us a idea of what is left to be done on the mapping analysis before the next committee meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3821.526s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The intent, the goal of the mapping analysis and what's needed from councillors to complete it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4087.475s">[Kit Collins]</a>: very hard for that overview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4089.937s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that'd be really helpful in guiding us for both of the tracks that we're talking about global strategies and district strategies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4098.943s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think my, my only question at this point is, you know, what do you need from councilors or city staff to complete these by our next committee meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4110.25s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that we can do these?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4220.623s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you, Paola and Jimmy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4222.464s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's great to hear that this is continuing apace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4226.366s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that Councilor Callahan has to depart in just a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4229.587s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are there any additional comments on the mapping analysis or should we start our very quick bullet point prioritization to round out the meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4238.672s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Paris?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4308.601s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4309.161s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm really excited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4309.981s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that'll be a really flexible tool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4312.283s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4312.643s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm excited to see that in our next committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4318.346s">[Kit Collins]</a>: With that, I apologize for the quick pivot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4321.107s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we should start our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4323.817s">[Kit Collins]</a>: quick recap of priority rankings, priority call-outs, so that we can get to that before councilors have to start leaving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4333.081s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So again, let's do a quick one or two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4335.662s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It can be as short as you need it to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4338.042s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If there's any impressions, ranking, prioritizations, those topics, Councilor Callahan, start with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4380.766s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4381.727s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4384.789s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4429.955s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4432.137s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4433.68s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4437.043s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4440.726s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Paris.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4542.383s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Tsengin, President Paris.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4547.124s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Of course, unsurprisingly, I agree with all of what's been said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4550.705s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that my top four would be affordable housing, courage, balanced growth, climate resiliency, and achieve slash evolve the 2022 Climate Action and Adaptation Plan with the same<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4568.271s">[Kit Collins]</a>: pieces of context that were just stated you know looking at that in the context of what does the most recently adopted building code already mandate for us but I know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4578.331s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to use my full 60 seconds, I think that what's most exciting to me in this zoning project is doing, you know, implementing every strategy that we can around affordable housing, encouraging that mixed use commercial development along our corridors, and implementing, you know, the full extent of our incentives and mandates around energy efficiency for our largest developers in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4599.755s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In addition to, you know, street level climate resiliency changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4612.497s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Paolo, we can be sure to send you my notes from this conversation, the clerk's notes to make sure that you have everything that you need to capture that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4624.151s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that if it is also useful to have Councilors do a more mural style exercise to send to you in the next couple of days or to provide additional context, I'm sure that Councilors would be amenable to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4641.426s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Director Hunt?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4755.779s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4756.579s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4757.54s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If I can say- Sorry, Paola, we're gonna go to President Bears real quick and then we'll come back to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4834.175s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4834.515s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think those last two points are very well taken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4836.896s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm hopeful that the 26 can be kind of our final meeting of this style where we're talking about kind of discussing how to discuss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4845.44s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're workshopping how to work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4847.64s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then with the product of the mapping analysis and what comes out of this work plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4853.463s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm hopeful that in June, we can start that cadence of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4858.2s">[Kit Collins]</a>: one meeting that's talking about global strategies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4861.661s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, personally, I would love to see us begin June with, you know, one meeting that's talking about global housing strategies, what's most actionable to get started on, knowing that any changes we advance will, you know, for the most part be bundled with other strategies that make sense and they're coherent with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4875.686s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then two weeks later, a meeting that's talking about a really priority district issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4879.547s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Like I think, Director Hunt, your point is really well taken, that there are some corridors that we, you know, we really have to get to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4886.573s">[Kit Collins]</a>: if we want them to look the way that they need to look for the future and the development that we wanna see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4894.177s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So let's plan for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4896.338s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Paola, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4974.858s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Paola, and I think that that matrix of importance and urgency will be really helpful to us in determining exactly what to talk about when, kind of to the point of what we were just talking about and the point that Director Hunt raised with the example of the uses currently allowed by Right on Mystic Ave, or sorry, in industrial zones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4999.977s">[Kit Collins]</a>: with that being said, just one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5026.462s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5027.082s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll add that as a note.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5032.864s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm not really stepping in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5037.545s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just taking a quick note.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5040.605s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5069.125s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5069.625s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think, to my mind, kind of to wrap up to talk about our next steps for the 26th, totally hear you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5075.766s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that's an important conflict.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5079.52s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think what might be additive for Councilors to follow up with the consultant about ahead of our next meeting is if Councilors feel moved to kind of further embellish the priorities that we talked about just now with doing a version of that importance versus urgency matrix that Paola showed earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5101.691s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If that hasn't already, you know, if there's anything that city staff have to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5106.018s">[Kit Collins]</a>: care to add along those lines, especially since you won't be present at our next committee meeting or actually scratch that last part because this is going to be completed by that committee meeting anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5115.505s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll just be reviewing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5117.046s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think that making sure that all of those, all of those thoughts, you know, are kind of on the record ahead of our next meeting in terms of what's our priority and also what's a priority because it really needs to be done sooner rather than later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5127.914s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5162.927s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for that suggestion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5163.828s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was actually thinking along similar lines earlier, and I know this committee meets a lot, but we're doing some of the most substantive work that the council is gonna do this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5174.018s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So if that can help move the ball forward to a place that we're all comfortable with, that sets us up with the information and context that they need to have a really ideally functional work plan for us, I think it's time well spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5187.199s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we can work on that over the next week to make sure, you know, to assess how valuable that would be and make sure that people would be free at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5195.101s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But until then, you know, Paola, if it's possible, if you could, I think I have the, you know, importance versus urgency matrix from the memo that you sent over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5203.743s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I could circulate that to committee members with the invitation to fill that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5214.687s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, within the next week, through me, I could send that back to you as some additional context for building out the work plan, just to make sure that, you know, again, all of those strongly held opinions about importance and urgency are on the record when we put forward this work plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5229.778s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're looking forward to having the completed mapping analysis to review on June 26th, and then we can also make sure that the spreadsheet of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5245.911s">[Kit Collins]</a>: recommended zoning changes pulled from the cap and the comp plan is updated along the lines that we discussed at the beginning of the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5253.094s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, adjusting that template so that it looks a little bit more similar to the implementation matrix that we're used to from the cap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5260.397s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, kind of having it flow from global to strategy so that they're not in the same column.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5266.54s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Having it sortable by district based strategy versus global strategy versus strategies that could apply in either case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5284.052s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5285.013s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5285.333s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we'll be in contact to make sure that you have all the information from this meeting that you need to move forward with all that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5296.799s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any concluding remarks, questions from members of the committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5303.563s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Or from city staff?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5308.922s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to adjourn by President Bears, seconded by Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5313.344s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5315.104s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seconded by Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5323.347s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seconded by Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5324.888s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mr. Clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5327.869s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5328.409s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All those in favor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5329.629s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5329.949s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All those against.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5330.589s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5331.71s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Paola and Jimmy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5333.971s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5336.752s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5338.72s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just forgot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=38.838s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=153.916s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=290.536s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=345.455s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would also like to extend my thanks and congratulations to all the organizers of this event and everybody who participated, signed up to host a band on their porch or contributed in other ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=354.096s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, this is the type of thing that Medford residents have been wanting to see more of for a very long time, and it's great to see this event growing and flourishing more and more every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=362.658s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you and my congratulations to the organizers and to all of the musical acts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=755.904s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=756.725s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=758.145s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just two quick questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=759.786s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When is the work plan to be done?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=761.968s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I noted the recommendations around sidewalk restoration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=765.61s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm just curious how much of the sidewalk is going to be restored?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=768.912s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is it just the area immediately around the pole or is it more of the block?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=775.555s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If you happen to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=781.755s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What other areas were you... Or just how far up and down the sidewalk will the restoration be extending, or is it just gonna be the area immediately around the pole?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=794.424s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=796.106s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=797.006s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And when is the work planned for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1399.279s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to approve pending the public comment period with the conditions recommended by the city engineer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1558.373s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1560.473s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This has come before City Council at a regular meeting once before when we procedurally had to refer it to the Community Development Board before it can come back to us for a formal vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1571.136s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is the first package of zoning change proposals to come out of the Planning and Permitting Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1577.457s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That committee has been working all year so far with the City Council's new zoning consultant on a host of zoning-related goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1585.639s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And this is that first set.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1586.78s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These are namely<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1588.44s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What I would characterize as formatting, streamlining, and procedural changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1592.983s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll get to our discussions of more of those bigger themes and bigger changes later in the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1598.547s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These are simpler.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1600.769s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The first is to, as was stated, just to quickly restate that we all know what we're talking about, changing the format of the table of uses and parking regulations so that that table is more readable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1611.156s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The intent of this is to put the parking and loading requirements into a format that is more<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1616.079s">[Kit Collins]</a>: intuitive, easier to understand switching away from a code based model.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1620.041s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so that it's all on the same page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1621.341s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So people who would like to do business in the city of Medford don't have to flip through our rather long code of ordinances to find what they're looking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1629.225s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The second is many definitions were amended or added into the definitional tables that these could be made useful later in the zoning process or to just update and modernize the definitions that we're currently using.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1642.37s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All of these changes were rigorously considered with city staff as well as zoning consultants over the course of several meetings in April and May.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1650.856s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are also taking a vote to adopt the GIS digital version of our zoning map.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1655.819s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There are no substantive changes being proposed to the zoning map.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1658.561s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is just to make it so the official on-the-book zoning map for the city of Medford is the one that is digital, is the one that has GIS letters, and is not the one that is quite literally paper and colored pencil.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1669.808s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A good step for year 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1672.41s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Finally, the last proposal in this package is to exempt certain municipal uses from the table of use in parking regulations and the table of dimensional requirements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1682.633s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is to streamline the process for the building of certain city infrastructure so that those buildings, for example, hypothetically, a new fire infrastructure, wouldn't have to go through the cumbersome zoning ordinance, zoning, sorry, zoning variance regulations that it would otherwise potentially be subjected to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1701.018s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would motion to take the first vote to be ordained after a comment from my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1820.949s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Need I make a motion to adopt the recommendation from the CDB in my motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=1826.611s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to approve with the typographical suggestion from the CDB.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2008.822s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2009.482s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would motion to suspend the rules to take papers 24-415, 24-045, 24-410, 24-413, 24-414,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2024.016s">[Kit Collins]</a>: out of order to join those papers for consideration and to suspend Rule 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2057.004s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3948.305s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3950.586s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3951.086s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Nice to see you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3954.56s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to thank you for the comprehensive proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3956.601s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also want to thank you for presenting each of these pieces in context of one another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3963.106s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For me, that is the theme and the precondition for this budget season is all of these pieces have to work together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3969.61s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is my third budget season that I've had as a councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3976.696s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is the least chaotic one so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3982.381s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let me put that another way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3984.103s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're facing some really big difficulties here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3987.126s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The budget process has always been difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3990.749s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's been difficult while I've been on the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3992.131s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know it's been difficult before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3993.612s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're coming off of a really difficult period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3995.334s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've always made it clear what my red lines are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3997.856s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This collaborative process has allowed us to reach a budget plan that I am<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4003.772s">[Kit Collins]</a>: comfortable and happy to put forward tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4009.116s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have known for a while that Medford has a funding problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4013.839s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This has been the topic of so many conversations between me and my colleagues in these chambers, outside of these chambers, the school funding problem and infrastructure funding problem, the capacity building problem, the problem of weaning off of one-time funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4027.729s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These are not problems that are unique to Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4030.211s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They're problems that we have to work through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4033.397s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In the two and a half years that I have been on the council, we have discussed, I think, every mechanism that could contribute towards the solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4038.9s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As a council, we've made zoning changes that could promote new growth, and we're working on more in our continuing zoning work that we'll put to votes later in the term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4048.484s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've discussed the city's ARPA strategy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4051.025s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears and I even proposed an override back in 2022, though it did not move forward, and that was robustly discussed in the previous term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4059.509s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This year, everybody is well aware that countdown clock on our strategy for the future is hitting zero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4065.693s">[Kit Collins]</a>: ARPA and ESSER are going offline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4067.034s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So since last fall, the financial task force, which was convened last year as a condition of the FY24 budget, has been meeting to talk about what's next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4077.301s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've been really proud to be a part of that process, which I joined when I joined city council leadership at the beginning of this term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4084.927s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that that has been part of that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4088.373s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that really important critical pivot towards greater collaboration, which has also been affirmed by you and your staff's participation in the budget ordinance process, as well as this collaboration on meeting the needs of this budget season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4102.498s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is the culmination of many meetings over many months discussing precisely what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4107.199s">[Kit Collins]</a>: our needs are and how to meet them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4109.001s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have rigorously considered the needs facing Medford public schools and city infrastructure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4118.271s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Among these branches of government, we certainly don't always agree, but the bottom line is that there's a set of facts and a set of goals that we are completely aligned on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4130.199s">[Kit Collins]</a>: then I also believe that the community fundamentally is aligned on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4134.143s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We need to maintain at least level service at MPS, we need to staff it properly, and we need to enable public education to start getting better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4141.57s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We need our roads and sidewalks to start getting better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4143.511s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We need to be in a position<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4145.453s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to pay our city and school staff competitively, and unless we take action, those things will not happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4151.398s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Our schools will not be what we want them to be, what we need them to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4155.442s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We will lose students to private schools, and those who cannot afford that type of expense will suffer the most.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4161.127s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Our infrastructure will depreciate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4163.269s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Those costs will get passed along to individuals at even higher rates, and we will lose good city workers to other municipalities or the private sectors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4172.551s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's always been a lot to discuss in how we solve these problems, but I truly believe that, for the most part, we are aligned on these facts and these goals, because we all know that those outcomes are unacceptable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4186.936s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think a hallmark of this proposal on how to pivot towards the future hinges on a combined approach of coming out of the reason that we're<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4202.557s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, can you tell I'm nervous?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4203.638s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is only the biggest vote that we take all year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4206.179s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Pardon me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4207.199s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just breaking the fourth wall here for a sec.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4214.383s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, we only had ARPA and ESSER to wean off of in the first place because we're coming off of such a hard time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4220.846s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And now we're adapting to that new normal, figuring out what it will require of us, and taking the affirmative steps to gain the revenue that we need to keep Medford a place that supports the people that live here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4237.662s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So for me, this budget is conditioned on its context.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4240.384s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are considering it in the context of two override proposals, one from President Bears and I, one from you, Mayor, totaling $7.5 million, which if they pass, will start stabilizing our school and city operating budgets in quarter three of this fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4254.256s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're considering that in the context of a $1.75 million appropriation to stabilize the school department in quarters one and two of this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4263.064s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And to me, that's critical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4264.705s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That is what my sense of confidence in this plan is hinged on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4268.628s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That gives us the breathing room to get to the override vote, which we put to residents in November without devastating effects happening to the school's department in the meantime.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4280.176s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then the overrides should they pass will allow us to start investing in things getting better and bringing up that baseline year over year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4287.702s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that a lot of people are frustrated that we have to be here at all contemplating overrides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4293.174s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that totally makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4295.218s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I really do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4296.4s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also wish that we were, I wish that this was something that no municipality had to contemplate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4304.549s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think it's important context to note that since 1990, 300 of the 351 cities and towns in Massachusetts have advanced at least one override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4313.574s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And many of them have done them lots of times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4316.395s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There have been over 4,500 individual overrides on ballots in municipalities since 1990.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4322.218s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For debt exclusions, that number is even higher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4325.299s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's been 313 cities and towns that have advanced debt exclusions since 1989.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4331.982s">[Kit Collins]</a>: totaling over 4,000 individual debt exclusions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4335.784s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I just put that out there to say, it is really serious to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4339.305s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is really serious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4341.426s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's why I'm glad that this is a mechanism that goes on the ballot so that residents of Medford will choose by popular vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4348.949s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is serious, but it is not an aberration to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4352.61s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that the fact that Medford is one of those few municipalities that has never done this is part of the reason that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4360.613s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Our budget seasons have been so hard lately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4365.196s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm proud that we're advancing proposals to start pivoting towards a more sustainable future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4369.959s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I will close by saying I am happy that this year we get to vote on not just a budget, but a plan to advance Medford out of underfunding and into a future where we can reliably provide better services for all students and all residents in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4389.11s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7496.309s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7497.53s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I went pretty long earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7498.53s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll try to keep this short, bring my average down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7503.194s">[Kit Collins]</a>: First thing, about the financial task force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7506.657s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that there's some people who don't need to hear this, but when we talk about the press release that was released on Friday, that we all collaborated on, city council leadership, mayor and the mayor staff, school committee leadership,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7518.243s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What that press release contained was the budget that was already made public, line by line, department by department, that the city council had already reviewed in budget hearings that the entire community was privy to if they cared to read those agendas or attend the meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7532.731s">[Kit Collins]</a>: those same numbers, very minor, essentially all the numbers that we already had plus one and three quarters million dollars from ARPA to the schools proposed and the two overrides and debt exclusion that everybody gets to vote on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7548.241s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just to clarify what was presented on Friday<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7553.638s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and how transparent or untransparent it was, was all the numbers that the city council and the school and the public already had, plus an appropriation of one-time funds, which many people, including myself, were hoping to see and working to secure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7567.564s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then three things that we get to put to the voters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7570.325s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I just want to set the record straight on that, because I think there's a lot of editorializing going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7576.768s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Second, we have discussed free cash a lot on this council, last term, this term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7585.415s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have had, you know, it's no secret that we disagree on a lot of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7589.218s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We agree on a lot of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7590.139s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've had some pretty sincere concerns about our free cash strategy in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7595.383s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have my own wishlist for how I'd like to see some of that money appropriated, which I know is different than the strategy that the mayor has.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7601.868s">[Kit Collins]</a>: To me,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7604.91s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That is irrelevant here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7606.373s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do not see the end game in appropriating large sums of our free cash reserves towards operating costs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7614.507s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What is the end game of that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7615.749s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We end up back here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7618.294s">[Kit Collins]</a>: we can wish upon a star that we're going to see new growth accelerate at such an incredible rate that we are going to be able to fill that gap exactly in 12 months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7628.377s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I don't think that we should be budgeting on wishful thinking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7631.058s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Again, I've had sincere concerns and grievances about how we're using free cash in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7637.44s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have my own preferences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7639.781s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is not the path forward that I think the community wants and needs to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7646.73s">[Kit Collins]</a>: allocate money towards the problem that we may never ever see again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7650.595s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It pushes the can down the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7655.2s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also think that finding these proposals divisive is completely a choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7659.164s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's one of the wonderful things about this being a ballot question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7663.169s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think, you know, we're a room full of people who have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7667.367s">[Kit Collins]</a>: voted differently on things in the past, we will again in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7671.768s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that doesn't have to make us any less of a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7674.089s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We can talk about it and discuss it and debate about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7676.27s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And some people will campaign one way and some people will campaign another way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7679.991s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it does not have to divide us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7682.892s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That is a choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7689.954s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think when people are telling you that you're being divided,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7694.5s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You should pay attention to what the motives behind that imperative might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7697.781s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You don't have to be divided by this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7699.562s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This can actually bring us together in a city with a future that is going to be brighter and more supportive because of what we might do with these investments if we pass them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7708.812s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Not willing to pass a budget based on wishful thinking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7711.473s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We can wish that new growth was different in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7714.154s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We can wish for dramatic new growth over the next 12 months that'll solve all of our problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7718.955s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That wouldn't be responsible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7722.016s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think that what we want as duly elected leaders of the community is for the ability to point the finger and blame somebody else for our problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7730.059s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we're all here to solve problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7733.02s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11758.258s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11763.171s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address of the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14105.796s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14107.056s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm really glad that we've had the opportunity to consider all of these papers together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14111.437s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Like I said earlier, I don't think there's any other way to consider all of these pieces than in context with each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14117.478s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm really glad that we got to hear from so many members of the community about each of these and about these budget-related proposals together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14128.92s">[Kit Collins]</a>: With that, I'm gonna motion that we divide the question and consider each item in this order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14134.121s">[Kit Collins]</a>: 24-413, which is the debt exclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14136.002s">[Kit Collins]</a>: 24-414, which is the mayor's $3.5 million override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14138.923s">[Kit Collins]</a>: 24-415, which is President Bears and mine $4 million override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14140.364s">[Kit Collins]</a>: 24-410, which is the ARPA allocation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14141.585s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then 24-045, which is the budget proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14142.585s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14230.675s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I reviewed the corrections that were sent over from the mayor's office, and I just want to note.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14234.298s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I got a lot of pages in this packet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14244.386s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just to clarify, is the correction being made that in the mayor's override proposal, which<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14251.267s">[Kit Collins]</a>: 4-414, the first instance that for FY25 appears, that's being deleted?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14259.955s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In the question, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14266.662s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just because that appears twice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14269.665s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For both, okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14273.206s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and I'd be happy to make that motion to adopt the corrections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14347.265s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sorry, was that amendment to do a similar deletion in 24-415?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14391.758s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14444.534s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14497.597s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14498.178s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14609.699s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14701.731s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sure, the rules are suspended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14704.434s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They're suspended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14953.272s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14954.873s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14957.075s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any additional comments from Councilors on this motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14960.196s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Callahan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15072.086s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15077.489s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15080.916s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll now move to the public perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15082.538s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15181.974s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15182.895s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll go now to Councilor Scarpelli on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15309.585s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15323.677s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15323.977s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And again, just to reaffirm that the city council is not the decision maker on the use of this parcel that is with the CDB and the DBA during the week of the 24th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15337.741s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address of the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15427.93s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15821.157s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for your nuanced perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15823.078s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15823.899s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm going to go to Zoom next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15827.141s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Danielle, on Zoom, you have three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15911.302s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15912.543s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll go to the podium now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=15913.343s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address of the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16087.884s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll go now to Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16090.385s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mariana, I'll ask you to unmute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16091.665s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Please state your name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16179.909s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16181.411s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll go now to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16183.322s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Bill on Zoom, I'll ask you to unmute, name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16297.274s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16298.635s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16299.787s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll go next to Mr. Castagnetti.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16421.203s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Lazzaro, and then we'll take our vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16461.907s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16463.027s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Appreciate that clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16464.708s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Before we go to our final hand on Zoom, I just want to segue from that to recenter that again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16471.473s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The city council will not be taking a vote on where this use ought to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16475.415s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We do not have the authority to take a vote on that matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16477.836s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The resolution before us tonight is not a referendum on the efficacy of methadone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16484.939s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We know that it is a medication that is used to treat a disease.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16488.741s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Substance use disorder is like every disease, not something that anybody chooses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16494.103s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And all patients should be treated with dignity and given every ability to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16500.612s">[Kit Collins]</a>: receive care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16501.212s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I thank the Councilor for recentering us on the intent of her resolution, which is to affirm that throughout the community of Medford, which is of course, and unfortunately, yet another community that has been ravaged by the opioid epidemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16516.962s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm glad to see us having discussions about how to best address that within our community for community members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16523.687s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll go to Tony on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16526.148s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16593.835s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16596.036s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any further comment from councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16597.977s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is there a motion on the floor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16600.318s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to receive and place on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16603.66s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to receive and place on file, offered by Councilor Lazzaro, seconded by President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16610.003s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mr. Clerk, when you're ready.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16653.353s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Whatever it was, I'll let you say it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16674.811s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're taking it from the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16675.792s">[Kit Collins]</a>: How's it going?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16702.793s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears, and thank you for co-sponsoring this resolution with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16706.176s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm very happy to recognize and celebrate Caribbean American Heritage Month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16713.142s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have many community members that are part of this vibrant community here in Medford, and it's great to have an opportunity to acknowledge these folks who hail from the Caribbean and have landed in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16725.954s">[Kit Collins]</a>: sometimes for a short time, sometimes for many generations, and to celebrate the ways that their culture and their contributions add so much to our community here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=16734.476s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So a happy Caribbean American Heritage Month to us all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=57.688s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=92.949s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Chair Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=95.691s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just to recap, I believe we had our first substantive discussion about this ordinance in February.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=109.827s">[Kit Collins]</a>: At that time, the committee approved a motion for me as sponsor of the paper to draft a, actually I believe we motioned to have an ordinance be drafted in February, I believe we discussed it in March.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=123.993s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I based the draft off of wildlife feeding ordinances that are present in other of our, you know, nearby or neighboring<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=130.936s">[Kit Collins]</a>: communities in Massachusetts and beyond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=134.36s">[Kit Collins]</a>: To quickly recap on the intent and goals of this ordinance, this is not an ordinance to illegalize bird feeders or to prevent any sort of normal<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=148.849s">[Kit Collins]</a>: activity that we do with, you know, household animals or songbirds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=154.676s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is in response to problems that residents have noted in the community with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=161.405s">[Kit Collins]</a>: food scraps being inappropriately left out as kind of deliberate lures for wild animals or inadvertent lures for wild animals that are creating the presence of, you know, a kind of destructive presence of wildlife.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=179.813s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In our residential neighborhoods, a couple residents have come to me and said, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=183.803s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My neighbors have this practice of leaving out XYZ unopened containers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=188.687s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's really a lot of food, it's a lot of peanuts, it's a lot of seeds, what have you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=193.872s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it would be one thing if the raccoons or the pigeons would stay on their side of the fence, but obviously animals do not observe private property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=202.079s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And our code enforcement currently does not have a mechanism for enforcing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=206.795s">[Kit Collins]</a>: this type of nuisance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=208.196s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So the intent of this ordinance is not to legalize any sort of harmless animal related activity, but just to be able to provide a recourse for Code Enforcement or Board of Health to issue warnings or tickets in the case of inappropriate animal feeding that really is creating a nuisance for other people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=232.375s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So at our last meeting on this topic in March, we passed several motions to receive feedback on the ordinance from department heads, code enforcement, from the Board of Health, from the animal control officer, and to receive a legal review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=249.274s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we have received some feedback from department heads on the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=253.618s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't know if any of them are on the call tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=255.319s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have some comments in my email from department heads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=258.242s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We also did receive a legal review from KP Law yesterday midday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=263.706s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this is the first chance that the council has to consider legal opinion on the ordinance as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=273.254s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that's the recap of where we are so far and I have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=277.496s">[Kit Collins]</a>: comments that I can offer about where I think we should go next with this, but I'll pause there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=444.062s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No, I was just gonna make a comment, but I wanted to wait for you to recognize me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=447.344s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, go ahead, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=448.264s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=449.925s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanted to, I think that, so this is the first time that we're seeing the legal review and just to recenter on, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=458.035s">[Kit Collins]</a>: possible avenues for this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=461.736s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have the feedback from department heads that we could review on the draft ordinance, and most of that has been positive and affirming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=471.36s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's been some suggestions for how to just firm up the language a little bit, but no contesting of the goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=480.704s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There are some comments from residents that I've received that I'd like to at least put on the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=484.981s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then this is our first opportunity to review the legal review together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=488.163s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think that it's possible that there might be some language changes that this committee might want to consider before we report this out to committee of the whole, just because we haven't had a chance to consider this legal opinion until doing it live.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=502.312s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=504.173s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I am happy to, because we don't have council with us here tonight, I'm happy to kind of run through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=514.558s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, this overview of the legal review of the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=518.242s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then I would also at the end, I would motion to circulate the legal review to committee members that we can, um, review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=527.89s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=528.731s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Uh, one second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=537.518s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=538.099s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=540.001s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Excellent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=543.231s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm gonna go over this kind of, I'm gonna try to go over this briefly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=553.961s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There was a recommendation to, I think, disaggregate intent from purpose and intent, or there was a recommendation that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=565.882s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Here, Attorney Braun says, some municipalities seek to add an intent element to distinguish between accidental feedings and intentional misconduct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=573.805s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As written, the section A just reads, the intent of this ordinance is to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=582.369s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That does seem to me like a good suggestion in the intent section to say the point of this is to target intentional inappropriate feeding, so that it's very clear that I've received some questions from residents around<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=594.844s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What does this mean for the garden in my backyard?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=598.165s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What does this mean for my beehive?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=600.446s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What does this mean for my bird feeder?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=602.867s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I do think it's important to make it clear that this is really targeting inappropriate feeding and not accidental feeding that does not result in nuisance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=612.952s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Though I think it is also true that this is an ordinance that will only be enforced when a problem actually occurs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=620.475s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so I think that's an important part of that remedy as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=624.11s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So there's a suggestion, i.e., whenever the animal control officer becomes aware the wildlife has been found feeding on any substance, dot dot dot, and the resident or person responsible has been notified of the occurrence thereof, any subsequent feeding shall be evidence that the feeding was with the knowledge or intent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=643.353s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that's, again, to focus on when somebody was given the opportunity to know better and kept doing it anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=651.595s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have a comment about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=655.117s">[Kit Collins]</a>: if, you know, garbage or compost centers unintentionally being the source of wildlife feeding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=663.88s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Again, this is kind of around making sure that nuisances don't accidentally arise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=668.342s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that there's a section later in this ordinance that kind of takes care of this in other language that essentially says, you know, the first penalty for violating this ordinance should it pass is never simply getting a fine, but rather<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=683.632s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, the enforcing officer saying, it looks like this is a source of a problem on your property, please remedy it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=691.758s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then failure to remedy it, of course, might require a further remedy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=704.347s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's a recommendation to define what a bird feeder is, just so there's no ambiguity there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=712.273s">[Kit Collins]</a>: always count on attorneys to point out to us what seems specific that might actually not be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=719.831s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Likewise, a recommendation to define pets, and this brings up a comment that was made earlier in this process, where do feral cats or stray cats fall?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=730.86s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Consider whether we want to specifically address cats, such as no person shall feed any feral or stray cat, or this section shall not apply to persons feeding feral or stray cats with the express purpose of adopting and domesticating them within a certain set number of days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=747.032s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that might be something of interest to this committee based on comments that were made in earlier meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=757.442s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Going further down to enforcement and penalties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=763.547s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Attorney Braun says, in my opinion, the non-criminal disposition statute requires that an ordinance must specify the enforcing authority to place residents on notice and may not delegate a designee to do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=773.35s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have a question about this because this seems dissimilar from how some of our other ordinances are written.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=780.332s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We often put X department head or their designee into our ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=785.233s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think this is certainly something that I'd want to double check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=793.57s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So to summarize, it appears to me that many of the comments are around defining with more specificity those terms around bird feeder pets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=803.998s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So it's very clear, you know, what is an allowable use in the case of bird feeders, which I think is a very common allowable use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=813.045s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Making sure that it's clear<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=815.026s">[Kit Collins]</a>: what I'm going to put in air quotes, what sanctioned animals, you know, are and are not included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=819.328s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think the exception for feral cats where there's the intent to domesticate and vaccinate them is one that might be relevant to Medford residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=831.375s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that there's a way to perhaps synthesize the suggestion around clarifying, you know, unintentional<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=842.236s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Nuisance creation via compost containers or garbage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=845.78s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think there's a way to just like dovetail that more specifically with the language that's already in the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=851.486s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And perhaps shoring up the intent section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=853.148s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have Most of the comments from residents that I have gotten apart from those who tell me that we really need this ordinance because they really need a remedy for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=864.248s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the nuisances that are finding their way onto their property because of foodstuffs that are adjacent to their homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=868.692s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A lot of those center around, you know, what does this mean about, again, what does this mean about my vegetable plot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=874.977s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What does this mean about my outdoor barbecue?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=878.259s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What does this mean about my bird feeder?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=879.881s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What does this mean about my beehive?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=881.282s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Should I ever get one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=883.043s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that the intent section could help to clarify, or sorry, excuse me, could help to clarify one, that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=891.394s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is an ordinance that seeks to correct for nuisances when they occur.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=895.459s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're not trying to outlaw any, we're not trying to regulate something that isn't causing a problem, but also to give more clarity around this is not,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=910.148s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is not something that's trying to eradicate any possible source of foodstuffs from somebody's backyard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=913.99s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's just simply trying to create the mechanism by which when there's a problem, code enforcement actually has an ordinance to point to so that they can enforce about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=922.814s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Because right now residents don't really have a recourse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=926.415s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'll pause there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1018.02s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1018.46s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just to add on to what you're already saying, and I can say this with some authority because I was on a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1024.043s">[Kit Collins]</a>: has a number of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1025.556s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the former Solid Waste Task Force when we spoke quite at length about the role of the composting program and understandable resident concerns about the composting containers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1036.762s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They're actually harder for animals to get into than the trash and recycling residential containers that residents are used to because most of them are actually locking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1046.006s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They're a thick plastic, they're locking, they have lids, and they have been shown in other communities to actually reduce the extent to which<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1054.656s">[Kit Collins]</a>: waste receptacles are an attraction to wildlife.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1058.419s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I certainly wouldn't want to give off the impression that composting is expected to be a greater attraction for wildlife.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1065.124s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think this again gets into not specific to trash and compost receptacles in particular, but rather, if anything, anything mundane happens to become an attraction for a nuisance, what then?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1078.394s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1079.52s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this is in line with how the ordinance is currently written, and perhaps there's a clarification we can make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1084.102s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But just to shore up that, if something is attracting a nuisance, the first step is to, for if neighbors can't work it out amongst themselves, for a city designee to say, this is attracting a nuisance, it's time to fix it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1094.928s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then if a remedy doesn't occur, then we have the same recourse that we do for any other nuisance that's going unremitied, which is a warning, a ticket, and then a fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1346.398s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think my recommendation, and if there's assent for this, I'm happy to offer it as a form of a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1352.6s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that I personally would benefit from some time offline to digest the legal review, which again, I apologize, I haven't had time to look deeply at it before it came in yesterday midday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1366.269s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As ordnance sponsor, like I created the first draft, I'm happy to create a revised draft that incorporates those suggestions around the bird feeder language from Director O'Connor and Animal Control Officer Hogan around the bird feeder to incorporate those suggestions from the legal review, provided that the rest of the committee agrees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1387.054s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And to include, that would be adding the intent section, adding that language around the definitions of bird feeders and pets,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1396.735s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, contemplating the exception for feral cats, depending on the will of the committee, and just making sure that all of the comments from the legal review that the committee agrees with are incorporated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1410.87s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Personally, I think I'd do that more effectively offline than during this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1418.024s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My motion would be to authorize myself as lead sponsor to do that work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1420.866s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then I would really prefer to bring a revised draft back before this committee as early as possible in July.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1426.389s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just because I know that I really appreciate the support on this ordinance that that has been expressed by Director O'Connor and Animal Control Officer Hogan and our code enforcement officers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1439.556s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know there's a lot of eagerness for this enforcement ability in the community from folks who are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1446.124s">[Kit Collins]</a>: currently suffering nuisances, so I would love to be able to incorporate those and then expedite that in a July committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1452.787s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, understood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1489.954s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1490.675s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Chair Lazzaro?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1492.115s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1493.416s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If we could, I don't know if we're getting to the end of our discussion, but if we are, I just would like to hear opinions from my fellow councilors and any city staff or interested residents who are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1505.501s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On the call on the feral cat exception specifically just to make sure that I am editing in the right direction for our revised draft that will contemplate in July.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1515.727s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When I read over the legal review, I thought that the exceptions mentioned seem reasonable to me, sort of that it's fine to do that sort of like very limited baiting for the express purpose of capturing feral cats where the full intent is to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1533.174s">[Kit Collins]</a>: domesticate, spay, neuter, and vaccinate them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1535.175s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think there's nothing wrong with leaving food out for wildlife in that case when the intent is to make them cared for pets and no longer wildlife.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1543.239s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Clearly that's a very different issue than leaving, you know, lots of peanuts out that are attracting a horde of pigeons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1548.441s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I just wanted to make sure that there was remit around that before I incorporate that exception into the next draft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1778.164s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1778.444s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I apologize for speaking over your council member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1782.56s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I think those points are well taken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1784.001s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also appreciate your perspective around not wanting to over litigate this because, of course, and I think that this is an important thing to remind ourselves and the public of when we're considering any ordinance with an enforcement mechanism, which is theoretically all of them, is enforcement kicks in when something is noticed to be in violation of the ordinance or creating a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1804.648s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I do think it's true what you say that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1808.757s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If baiting for wild cats so that they can be domesticated is going on and it's not creating a nuisance, then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1815.379s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the ordinance is not being violated and the ordinance does, you know, then it's not creating a nuisance, it's a non-issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1822.581s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that is true whether or not the ordinance says so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1827.523s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think it might be kind of a wash whether we put it into this language or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1831.965s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would maybe propose that we, since this suggestion is new as of the legal review, I would maybe suggest that we run this exception by the animal control officer who I don't think could be on the call tonight just to get his two cents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1842.968s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then that could be something that we,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1846.107s">[Kit Collins]</a>: dispense with one way or another at our follow-up meeting in July when we hopefully finalize the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1949.721s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Chair Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1950.542s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1951.402s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think it's always a good point to make that ordinances<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1957.885s">[Kit Collins]</a>: for setting policy or creating a remedy for problems, but it's also important to take the time to make sure that the language doesn't have unintended consequences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1968.148s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think that that is an issue here, but I certainly appreciate the feedback that we've gotten from residents on this and just clarifying notes raised in the legal review to make sure that the language is really clear in what this ordinance is about and what it isn't about so that we have a recourse for solving problems when they arise and when there is a problem that people can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1988.14s">[Kit Collins]</a>: feed birds and keep bees in peace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1990.821s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I want to thank our department heads for their comments on the ordinance and for their support of this ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1999.064s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I appreciate all the residents that have advocated for this and weighed in on it from any direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=12.764s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=257.875s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=258.995s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to congratulate you again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=260.876s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Rick, in my culture, we have a name for a person like you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=263.677s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's a mensch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=264.778s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And, you know, this past week was, you know, we all talked about your service and making sure that this elderly tenant had a safe landing spot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=272.541s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I know that for you, this is just, you know, that was just a regular Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=276.183s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it's that kind of service that makes this honor so well earned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=278.624s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you for doing what you do all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=433.275s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears, for co-sponsoring this resolution with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=437.518s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Jewish American History Month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=440.25s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Heritage Month, excuse me, is a relatively new commemoration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=445.133s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It was first proclaimed in 2006.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=446.894s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It was a collaboration between the American federal government and Jewish museums throughout the nation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=453.158s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that this is a wonderful opportunity to thank Jewish culture bearers in Medford, not just for their contributions, but for continuing to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=460.623s">[Kit Collins]</a>: tell the stories of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=462.406s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it's a good reminder to thank all culture bearers of all communities within Medford for continuing to tell their stories and share their culture and their history with the entire community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1041.62s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We met again with the city council zoning consultant, and we reported out several items which are all on the city council agenda tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1049.345s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The table of use and parking regulations, updating some definitions, updating just the digital version of the existing zoning map, and municipal exemptions, no substantive changes, just some tweaks to streamline the city's zoning procedures while we work with the zoning consultant on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1070.376s">[Kit Collins]</a>: more thematic changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1071.636s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1173.752s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1180.334s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1181.794s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1188.856s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to suspend the rules and take 24-366 out of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1441.274s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1603.068s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1629.96s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1632.341s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This council has for a long time been a forum for residents when they are in a time of need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1638.824s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's fitting that former Councilor Caraviello is here tonight because in my first term, you know, he was the liaison that bridge that made that connection with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1650.67s">[Kit Collins]</a>: a whole group of tenants that were in a time of need and I think early 2022 with the Bradley Road tenants and made sure that Councilors were informed of what was happening in their building and could offer whatever support we could as they sought their next safe haven in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1668.442s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm glad that this council can be a forum to hear from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1671.784s">[Kit Collins]</a>: residents in any occasion of need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1675.025s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Over the past several months, tenants at the Brooks Park apartments have been keeping councilors informed of their situation, which includes, you know, the property changing hands, and unfortunately, a wave of displacement and evictions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1689.949s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I understand that they've been seeking to converse and discuss and negotiate with their property owners that they can remain in this community, and I am grateful to them for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1699.952s">[Kit Collins]</a>: appearing tonight so that we can hear an update directly from the source about the status of their tenancies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1705.835s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3127.745s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3129.786s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to thank again everybody who's spoken so far, everybody who's spoken as a member of the Tenants Association, and to the people who have come here to stand in solidarity with them, or the people who found themselves here and are supporting them nonetheless.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3143.509s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3146.186s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That seems like a really Medford thing to me to say, you're my neighbor and I want you to be able to stay here and I want you to stay a part of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3153.901s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I wanted to keep it brief at the beginning to pass the mic to the folks who are really going through this, but I just want to give a little bit more context about how I came to know about this issue that these tenants are facing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3162.767s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's been almost a year since I heard about the sale of the Brooks Park Apartments for the first time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3169.392s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It was actually somebody who lived, who owns a condo up the road who first reached out to me and said they had seen the for sale sign and they were really worried because they knew that this was naturally occurring affordable housing and they were worried about what would happen to the tenants after it was sold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3182.322s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It was shortly after that that myself and President Bears, together with the planning department, started spending a few days just on the phone, all the time talking to an interested affordable housing developer and trying to see what we could do to make sure that this building would be competitive to sell to an affordable housing developer instead of to a for-profit housing developer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3204.26s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that didn't happen, unfortunately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3205.981s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The offer just wasn't competitive with what the corporate property owner could offer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3211.566s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I remember thinking, it's going to happen again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3214.55s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What happened on Bradley Road is just going to happen again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3216.852s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we're just waiting for it to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3219.596s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, and then several months later, it happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3222.439s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we saw that wave of notice to quit notices go out to these two, we're hearing about that wave of evictions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3231.488s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And you know that just it, it breaks my heart as a representative of neighbors in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3237.472s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When people from up the street or people who are going through this come to me as a city councilor and say, what are you doing about this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3244.697s">[Kit Collins]</a>: How can you stop this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3245.618s">[Kit Collins]</a>: How can you how can you keep these people in our community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3248.16s">[Kit Collins]</a>: How can you help me to stay in this community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3251.522s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it breaks my heart because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3254.07s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's not a lot we can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3255.011s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We had this conversation when Bradley Road was happening, we said we can stand with you, we can support you, and we can platform what you're going through, we can platform your testimony, we can stand with you when you rally outside the building, when you try and try and try to get your property owner just to talk with you, just to try and recognize you as a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3273.564s">[Kit Collins]</a>: a group of residents that are trying to collectively bargain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3277.246s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But the state doesn't give us any other tools for keeping our residents who want to stay here in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3285.009s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We don't have those tools that other states have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3288.87s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, I think that I'm so glad that we're talking about what it will take to put the city in a position where we can in the future buy a building like this and say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3301.28s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We got this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3302.441s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll protect you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3303.561s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That building's up for sale.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3304.982s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're going to buy it so that Medford residents can stay there in perpetuity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3310.005s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're not at that place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3310.925s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think they're growing an affordable housing trust fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3314.407s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The analogy that comes to mind is it's like planting a tree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3317.249s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Right now we're planting that tree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3318.429s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That sapling is in the ground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3319.63s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's been in the ground for three months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3321.511s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's going to be decades before we can turn that into<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3327.591s">[Kit Collins]</a>: purchasing buildings that will be affordable housing for members of this community, unless we start planting immediately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3333.817s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's what's so sad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3334.738s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're behind the eight ball.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3336.459s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we need to be thinking about growing that forest so that this doesn't keep happening again in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3341.624s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But in the short term, we need more tools to help people like the tenants that are before us this evening, whose problem is right here and right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3349.851s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It can't wait 20 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3351.809s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I want to thank you so much for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3353.27s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And every time that a tenant speaks out for themselves and their neighbors, they're speaking out for all tenants who don't want to be moved around the region like pawns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3359.795s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They want to stay here in their community where they work and have friends and have family and have invested and want to keep investing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3367.481s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3949.133s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3955.074s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just want to note that I think we've gotten pretty far off of the topic of the resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3959.075s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would like to respond to the misinformative spin put on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3966.098s">[Kit Collins]</a>: actions that I've made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3967.459s">[Kit Collins]</a>: However, I'd prefer that we get back on topic and get on with the meeting because talking about the transfer fee was not on the agenda for tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3973.985s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5421.0s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm gonna make a quick comment, and then I'm gonna make a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5425.021s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Actually, I'll make the motion first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5426.021s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The motion is to receive and place on file, I guess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5440.23s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, that's a better idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5665.046s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5665.987s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is the first package small package of updates to come out of the planning and permitting committee and its work with the zoning consultant that the city council hired at the beginning of this term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5677.518s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we're starting it off with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5680.16s">[Kit Collins]</a>: some proposals that I think will be, you know, relatively minor procedural compared to the scope of work that we will be continuing on for the rest of this term, which will be, you know, kind of encountering those bigger questions that constituents have been coming to us with for years around residential development and commercial development and mixed use development and incorporating the goals and themes of our comprehensive plan, climate plan, housing production plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5705.359s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These are less sexy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5708.886s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've been working with the zoning consultant and planning staff and the new building commissioner to make<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5716.969s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What's the word I'm looking for kind of some like formatting changes to the table of use and parking regulations, so that all of the relevant information is on the same page and updated so that it's more readable, so that when city staff and potential developers are looking for this information, they don't have to go flipping through our very low court ordinances to find it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5736.107s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have also added and made some adjustments to the definitions in the zoning code to bring that up to best practice and to include some definitions that we might need to include later when we do tweak the zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5747.833s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We would like to adopt the new digital GIS zoning map.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5752.775s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's been no material changes to the zoning map proposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5755.717s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'd just like to move away from the literally colored pencil version and have the official version be the digital version instead, which I think is a great step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5764.601s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And finally, the proposal also includes certain municipal exemptions from the zoning code ordinances so that major city projects, for example, a new fire headquarters will be able to proceed in a more efficient, streamlined manner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5779.404s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So procedurally, this has to be referred to the Community Development Board before this council can take a vote to codify it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5785.705s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'd motion to send it to the CDB.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5800.909s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6253.496s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6844.0s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll let George go and then I'll speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=0.369s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, I believe Councilor Callaghan will be on with us in just a couple of minutes when she's able to get online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=7.492s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Since we have a quorum present, I'm going to call the meeting to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=11.173s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There will be a meeting of the Planning and Permitting Committee, May 22nd, 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=15.975s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This meeting will take place at 6pm via Zoom only.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=18.776s">[Kit Collins]</a>: To submit written comments, please email ahertabse at medfordma.gov.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=24.039s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mr. Kirk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=31.517s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mr. Clark, I can't hear you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=71.107s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, I believe that she'll be joining online just a few minutes late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=74.59s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For present one absent, the meeting is called to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=77.893s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The action and discussion item for tonight is again paper 24033, zoning ordinance updates with the Innes Associates team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=86.8s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've been meeting with the Innes Associates team together with other key stakeholders and supporters in the zoning overhaul process very frequently in this committee over the past few months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=100.552s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Our last meeting of the Planning and Permitting Committee was also on this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=103.614s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll just briefly recap what we talked about in that meeting, talk about our specific goals for this meeting, which we talked about on the 8th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=113.418s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have some items to report out and then hopefully at the end of the meeting, we can briefly tee up what else we plan to do in June to accomplish with this team by the end of the fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=123.986s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm hoping that we can, since we had such a robust discussion on May 8th, I'm hoping that we can get everybody out of here by pretty close to 7, if not before 7.30.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=134.514s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know there is another committee<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=140.446s">[Kit Collins]</a>: meeting after this one tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=146.536s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On the 8th, we had a long and robust discussion about some of the definitions in the current code of ordinances that are to be updated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=154.22s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that informs that kind of piggybacks and other conversations that we've had with this team about necessary updates to the table of uses and to site plan review, changes to the zoning ordinances that will make administrative work on the city side more streamlined before we get into the work of substantively changing the zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=173.989s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So building off of those conversations tonight, I'm hoping that we can touch on the following topics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=181.332s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Going over the general plan for the review of Medford zoning ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=186.234s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Reviewing the recommended updates to the definitions and use table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=191.497s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Reviewing the site plan review options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=196.739s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Discussing our plan for reviewing the climate action and adaptation plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=202.765s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and then we'll touch on our plan for the schedule for meetings in June and what zoning update topics we will review when in June and further out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=218.28s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just checking my notes to make sure I didn't leave anything off of that list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=224.93s">[Kit Collins]</a>: overall the goal for tonight is to review recommendations for table of uses, definitions and use table, site plan review options, and make sure that we can report those out to local city council so that they can be referred to the CBP so that we can get those changes moving along efficiently by the end of the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=244.496s">[Kit Collins]</a>: With that I want to, if there's no<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=248.123s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If there's no preliminary comments by my fellow councilors or by city staff, I'm happy to kick it over to Paola to introduce what is on tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=262.533s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=263.054s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I wasn't sure we landed on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=264.194s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=265.135s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So the other item to review tonight and make sure it gets reported out is the GIS zoning map.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=272.921s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And Mr. Clerk, I see that Councilor Callahan is present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=277.89s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, unless Director Hunt or other city staff have anything to add, Paola, please feel free to go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=341.229s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it might probably cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=513.357s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Paula.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=515.478s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll just jump in to paraphrase and summarize from our conversation about this on May 8th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=521.521s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The recommended change to this table of uses is that we're switching from... Can you just spell it out for folks who might not have been at our previous committee meeting, the flag changes in gold?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=563.806s">[Kit Collins]</a>: this is to make sure that the relevant information is all on the same page for when city staff or developers are looking for this information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=570.233s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=571.855s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are there any other questions on this slide from councillors or city staff members of the public?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=577.881s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Director Hunt, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=715.91s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=716.25s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=716.85s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So let's make sure that, um, a footnote to this effect is incorporated in whatever version is reported out tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=723.574s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You can make all motions at the end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=976.034s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any comments or questions from counsellors on that first set of definitions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=983.761s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Paula, could you just quickly go through the slides again of the definitions that you just showed us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=989.466s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Or even just that title slide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=991.53s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=992.811s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Doggy daycare, institutional use, mixed use, motor vehicles, and accessory use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=997.894s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These were among the many that we discussed on the 8th, and I think these were the ones where it was most clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=1003.718s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that was the direction to go in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=1007.76s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Not seeing any questions from fellow councillors, let's go along to the next set.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=1013.164s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=1261.12s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think personally, I think that if our goal is to report all of these out tonight, we should deal with the thorns as we encounter them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=1272.065s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Questions or comments or suggestions from counsellors on the need for reconciliation that Paola just mentioned?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=1303.19s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would say that for myself as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=1312.598s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My priority is making sure that we don't, I think the phrase we were using last time is we don't want to break the zoning by implementing new terms before the rest of the zoning code is ready for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=1321.744s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I like the approach of making new terms available and then implementing them when we're ready.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=1327.947s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So Paola, if it's the professional opinion of Innes Associates that this is the definition that accomplishes that, then I think that's how we should go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=1338.652s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any other comments from councillors or city staff on this one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=1342.773s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=1343.153s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=1343.513s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let's go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=1747.627s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll recognize Pointer Evans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=1828.823s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=1829.624s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=1830.344s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think, you know, this process is bringing to the fore certain present or future uses that we don't have definitions for yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=1839.713s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And since we know that this is a use that exists in neighboring communities, but less so in Medford, I think this is one that we should put on the list of things to revisit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=1848.26s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in future packages of changes if that seems like an okay cadence to city staff and to your team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=1856.563s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Personally, I think that these proposals look good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=1860.185s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also think that, you know, the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=1862.886s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that there's a lot of good reasons to adopt the, you know, dwelling one unit attached aka row house or, you know, the aka duplex that seems useful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=1872.709s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that would be, I would be happy to go forward with those tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=1879.391s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any other comments, questions from councillors, city staff on this one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=2015.941s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll recognize Director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=2254.422s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=2255.042s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And yeah, I think some definitions are updated or so that it's more clear to people who do work and what uses are encouraged and allowed or permitted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=2269.707s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so that if the building commissioner feels that that's something that would be helped by including this definition for the first time, that sounds good to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=2280.55s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let's keep it moving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=2360.843s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So these are- Thank you, Paola, I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=2368.348s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Having reviewed these two, and I just want to, I think for these, oh, and thank you, Commissioner, we'll get to you in just a sec.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=2378.955s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think for arranging these definitions, since we had such a substantial conversation about these in our previous committee meeting, I want to pivot and see if there are questions on these two that we just went over, and maybe even for the definitions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=2392.165s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Rounding out this batch,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=2395.014s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, let's gloss over all the headlines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=2398.698s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let's, you know, you or I can read the definitions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=2401.32s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then I think, based on our substantive conversation last time, I think we could be at the point where we can raise red flags where there are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=2408.727s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think we left this off in a really great place at our last meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=2413.712s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Commissioner van der Waal, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=2460.235s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Commissioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=2460.935s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, we can make sure to check on that before these come before the council and report it to the CBB.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=2467.619s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Paola, for introducing these last two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=2470.12s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are there any questions or comments from councillors or city staff before we proceed on to the next terms?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=2479.145s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=2585.373s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=2585.633s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll go to President Bears and then Planner Evans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=2631.445s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sure, many bites at the apple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=2633.006s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, Paola, if we could proceed, and then we'll just, I think let's, in the interest of time and our full agenda for this meeting, let's read off, you know, this term will be defined, junkyards, take a beat, and if council or city staff have concerns or questions, we can stay on those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=2654.98s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If not, we can proceed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=2656.221s">[Kit Collins]</a>: How's that sound?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=2712.95s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So, those are the questions or comments from counsellors on junkyards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=2720.334s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing none, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=2787.743s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=2788.224s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=2788.804s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think we had a really, for me, a helpful conversation about this on the 8th, Commissioner Venable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=2837.292s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=2838.272s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any questions or flags other than that one on accessory use?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=2848.999s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let's proceed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=2954.2s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=2954.78s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for introducing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=2956.741s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that the clarification of when is it becoming an establishment is very clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=2962.144s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Callaghan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=3020.504s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=3022.245s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's a good point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=3023.106s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm not sure that that type of constraint would occur in the definition, but I think it's something for us to consider elsewhere in the zoning ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=3031.613s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears and then Planner Evans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=3055.001s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=3085.403s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any other questions or concerns with eating establishments cafe slash coffee shop neighborhood cafe?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=3096.707s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is that a new hand, present bearish, or an old one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=3100.628s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=3103.049s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let's go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=3218.533s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think, Paula, if you could kind of summarize these as a unit, I think that would be the most comprehensible, at least to this counsellor, rather than going through the definitions individually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=3372.073s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=3373.414s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=3373.754s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this does an admirable job of putting verbal language to a very visual concept.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=3378.658s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Commissioner van der Waal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=3545.762s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, thank you Commissioner van der Waal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=3547.123s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that my M.O.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=3550.686s">[Kit Collins]</a>: for the definitions at this stage is to make sure that we're advancing the ones that T.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=3554.968s">[Kit Collins]</a>: up for future good decisions, even if those future good decisions are necessary to keep improving the zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=3561.813s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I wouldn't want to advance a definition that further confuses the issue, but if an exception<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=3566.916s">[Kit Collins]</a>: or kind of like a fringe case can be added on top of this foundational definition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=3572.357s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If we feel that's the case with advancing these tonight, then I think that we should.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=3576.398s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then, you know, again, before implementing these in the zoning code, figure out what other fringe cases or exemptions need to be added in so that we are covering all of our bases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=3586.341s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Before we move on, Planner Evans?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=3732.389s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=3733.01s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=3734.03s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I do recognize this is one of the ones that was a bit in a less formed state in our last community meeting about definitions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=3740.933s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just want to pause there for any questions from councillors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=3808.729s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=3809.029s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know for myself as one councillor, I think that having more visual definitions to accompany the verbal ones will make these even more clear for everybody who's using them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=3821.974s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And certainly knowing that these are in the queue makes me comfortable with advancing these tonight as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=3827.897s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Before we get any last comments on these definitions from councillors and move on, Commissioner Redville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=3865.331s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Right, thank you, Commissioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=3866.772s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I can definitely see how that would be really useful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=3870.579s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=3870.939s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Were these the last two definitions that we had to review, Paola?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=3972.342s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Paula.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=3973.503s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think, I think, yeah, my confusion with this is what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=3977.775s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, hang on a second, Commissioner Van Der Waal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=3982.238s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think my question here is right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=3983.779s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What about those right angle situations where, how do you determine which one is the front where the property line divides the street against, oh, hang on, when there's two rights away that it's abutting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=3995.627s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'll recognize you, Commissioner Van Der Waal and then Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4040.741s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4041.861s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Callaghan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4078.009s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4078.209s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this is a preview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4079.049s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4079.45s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I always appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4080.95s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4082.571s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4088.49s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have a motion from President Bears to refer up these definitions and we did have a flag to include that footnote around parking code exemptions into the use table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4101.94s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4102.681s">[Kit Collins]</a>: To report out the table of use and changes, seconded by Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4153.1s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4155.881s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Shall we vote on that now or save it all?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4158.343s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let's save all the motions for the end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4164.085s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There is a second from Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4198.14s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, and I just want to thank you, President Bears, and I just want to restate that the zoning map, there are zero substantive changes to the map.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4206.602s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's just that we're, you know, officially codifying the GIS digital version.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4210.484s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There are no changes to the zoning map.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4212.304s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think, you know, yeah, we can spend one or two minutes on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4216.386s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that's just procedural.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4217.527s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then if we can try to go over municipal exemption, this is again a topic that we've talked about in previous meetings, that this is kind of the culmination of those conversations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4229.618s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And if we, let's see if we can get through that by 7 30.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4235.23s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, Paola, if you want to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4236.351s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Paola, are you comfortable talking about the GIS zoning map, or is that something that a PBS staff member would like to just quickly go over?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4324.037s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Anything to add, veterans?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4384.066s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4384.446s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this is essentially, this is something that we have to do procedurally, and this way covers our basis in case anything very, very minor has incidentally changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4394.781s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So there's already a motion to report out the GIS digital zoning map to our next regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4401.825s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for just bringing us up to date on how that's come to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4407.607s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So let's tackle our next and last item that has to be reported out tonight, municipal use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4414.111s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Again, let's try to, let's see if we can recap that process by 7.30 and I'll quickly tee up our proposed agenda items for our next couple of meetings in June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4423.812s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and let councillors get along to their next committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4425.954s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, Paola or Tony Silverstein, if you'd like to just briefly summarize the conversations that we've had around municipal exemption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4573.373s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Attorney Silverstein.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4574.814s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I really appreciate the overview of the why of this, why this is meaningful on the city side and walking through the changes to put this into effect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4588.678s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Do I have any questions, concerns from our fellow Councilors or a motion to report this out to the next regular meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4598.282s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4740.476s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4742.757s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Understood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4745.497s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4747.758s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any further questions or comments from the fellow councillors on municipal site review?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4757.133s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing none, do I have a motion to refer this out to the next meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4765.215s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Do I have a second on the motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4811.459s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, Mr. Clerk, is it now two motions, one to refer out the table of use, definitions, municipal site plan review changes, and then to refer the GIS digital zoning map out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4821.467s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I put them all in one motion, I'll have to read it back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4823.288s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All in one motion, perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4824.349s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Nope, that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4826.01s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4828.072s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing no hands raised, you can take the vote on that motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4834.677s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4835.578s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Offered by President Bears, seconded by Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4839.121s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4859.272s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4860.412s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Five in fair, zero opposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4862.634s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion passes and these four items are reported out to the city council regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4868.299s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just to recap,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4871.445s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm just going to stop your screen share for the last five minutes of the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4877.966s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4878.807s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just to recap these four items, the changes to the table of uses, the definitions that we discussed, the municipal site plan review and the GIS slash digital version of the zoning map.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4890.229s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These will all appear on the city council agenda next Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4895.45s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Procedurally, they must then be referred to the CDB for their review, and then they will come back to the City Council for a final vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4903.273s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that's several more opportunities for discussion should any concerns or questions arise, or should, of course, the CDB have any recommendations or changes that they would like to flag for the Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4918.117s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Before we adjourn, I just wanted to preview our draft topics for our two committee meetings with Innes Associates in June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4930.847s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have been having conversations about site plan review other than municipal site plan review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4937.492s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that Innes Associates has been working hard on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4939.833s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that we've also been talking about reviewing the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan, which Innes Associates has begun to do to mine that for those zoning policies that ought to be incorporated into our comprehensive look at the zoning code.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4956.74s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think our June 8th meeting would be a good time to touch on both of those topics and drill down a little deeper and make sure that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4966.195s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're having a comprehensive update on site plan review, and that we're making sure that everything from the climate action adaptation plan that ought to be incorporated into our work plan is inside of the work plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4977.8s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then on our June 22nd committee meeting, this will be our, I believe this will be our final meeting with the zoning team in this committee before the end of the fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4987.243s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that we can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=4989.301s">[Kit Collins]</a>: tie off that milestone by having a last meeting to make sure that any climate-related policies from the comprehensive plan or other ideas from councillors are tied up in a bow in our work plan for our kind of more theme-based approach to the zoning overhaul throughout the summer and into the fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=5011.393s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that would be site plan review and the cap on the 8th, and then tying off any additional climate-related pieces<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=5018.638s">[Kit Collins]</a>: on the 22nd, and I'm sure that we'll have a couple other, perhaps more minor topics for the 22nd as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=5026.667s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any additional comments, questions from fellow councillors or city staff or things that I neglected to mention?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=5053.935s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=5054.996s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes, we've spoken about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=5058.519s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes, and Director Hunter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=5116.302s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=5117.203s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I wish I could say this is the first time you've caught an egregious date error on my part, but it's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=5123.827s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that would be site plan review, the cap, a first view of the mapping analysis on June 12th, which is a Wednesday, and then that second committee meeting in June is on the 26th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=5144.161s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that is on the 26th, so it will be a constant because of the 19th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=5146.883s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, that's good to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=5148.684s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=5150.745s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well, thank you so much, Paula and the NS Associates team for all of the prep work for this presentation tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=5156.769s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's exciting to get our first batch of changes out to the council where they can be sent to the CBB and then back to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=5165.575s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Our first package of many.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=5166.936s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is there any additional comments by my fellow councillors, city staff, or members of the public?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=5178.59s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing none, do I hear a motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=5185.035s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to adjourn by Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=5188.157s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Second by President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=5221.588s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=5222.509s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=5223.129s">[Kit Collins]</a>: None opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=5224.409s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UEleLeeXrzM&t=5226.35s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you very much, everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=375.336s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for being here as always, and for walking us through the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=381.122s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's always great to hear about how certain positions and capacity in the city are being funded by grant funding I know that your office always does a really great job of leveraging that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=391.072s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just a quick clarification on some of the personnel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=395.737s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You walked us through the community social worker and the administrative support that's being funded through some of the grants that you just mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=402.101s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I saw that one of the part-time nurses looks like it's coming offline, or maybe that was just reallocated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=407.845s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Could you speak to that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=443.899s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=444.8s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just to clarify, so is that monies that are available for a seasonal nurse or is that it's it's more appropriate to use that funding for the community social worker at this time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=452.505s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=454.306s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just to make sure I understood you correctly, is it that the being for are being put towards a seasonal nurse like during the like the flu season or is it that it's being reallocated to the social worker?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=475.725s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes, it does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=476.246s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=476.526s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=476.826s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think the AC makes it even harder to hear the normal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=479.509s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2731.838s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2733.139s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2734.28s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for the presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2735.361s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I always appreciate the very thorough walkthrough that you give us into the school committee's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2742.845s">[Kit Collins]</a>: recommendation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2744.426s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Of course, as has been stated, you know, the City Council has no jurisdiction when it comes to line items, when it comes to how the Schools Department chooses to spend whatever appropriation that's given each year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2757.676s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That is beyond our scope, but still I find it really helpful context for understanding the number that comes before us, so thank you so much for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2765.126s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, speaking of individual line items, you know, for myself as an individual Councilor, like anybody else in the city, I hold individual opinions about particular positions or programs that to me seem really vital and important, that seem like they must be protected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2779.456s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But as a Councilor in this role, it is deeply important to me that we advance a budget, advance a budget plan that gives our school's administration the latitude to do right by students, families, educators, all school staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2792.085s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it's my understanding that that's the number that was just explained to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2795.906s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This year, I am optimistically expected to cast a yes vote for a budget that includes this school's appropriation for the 79 million that puts students and families' minds at ease, that's fair to teachers and school workers, and that gives our public schools the ability to start doing more rather than less.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2813.714s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that isn't a reflection whatsoever on the district, I don't think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2816.755s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're coming off of a pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2818.076s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We know we're in a really difficult fiscal situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2821.577s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But based on what I hear,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2823.638s">[Kit Collins]</a>: from the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2824.439s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that there's this widespread consensus that we have to start improving, and we have to be really serious about what that takes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2835.309s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Personally, I think that education is one of the most important services that a city provides, and our budget should reflect that by meeting the school committee request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2845.95s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears spoke a little bit about the need for additional revenues to make that manifest and about the work that the financial task force has been doing around that question for months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2858.524s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's still being worked out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2860.666s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've been having some really<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2862.828s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, some tough conversations, some good, some productive conversations, but I believe that this community is ready to do what it takes to say, you know, this is the fiscal year and we're going to pivot towards making public education better in Medford and better for everybody who interacts with that system and competitive with the other options that are out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2884.638s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, when it comes to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2886.826s">[Kit Collins]</a>: talking about, you know, the prop two and a half override that is probably, well not, I don't think it's probably likely, I think it's definitely needed to maintain level service in the city and start making strides towards not just level service but improved service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2900.516s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is something that I have been, you know, publicly advocating for, for, you know, the last two budget cycles, because we need to start preventing exactly the type of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2913.223s">[Kit Collins]</a>: cuts that are being talked about that are in the realm of possibility if we don't change course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2918.544s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that many people in the community are at the point of saying this chronic underfunding can't go on any longer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2927.506s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't want to turn this into a conversation about increased revenues, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2935.939s">[Kit Collins]</a>: with the number that's before us and knowing that the, you know, it's not an invisible asterisk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2940.823s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's a very obvious asterisk next to that number is what will it take to get there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2945.027s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that the conversation about that should be comprehensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2948.47s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It should take as long as it needs to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2950.132s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that something that will come up in that question is what will it cost?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2953.815s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to do that, to fulfill this request and all that it will mean for students and teachers and families?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2959.097s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What will it cost people to do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2961.198s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And what I think about when I think about that question, what I think about with the various versions of the school department budget that have been put before the community is, what does it cost the community when we don't do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2973.204s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What does it cost in tutoring fees?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2976.465s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What does it cost in private school tuition?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2978.526s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And the people who simply can't afford to augment the public school experience, it costs them most of all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2984.71s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I thank you very much for this presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2987.071s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As one Councilor, you know, President Bears has, I was planning to start my spiel with, again, hammering home what role we do have in this process and what role we don't have at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=2998.658s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's already been well taken care of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3001.599s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But as myself as one Councilor tonight, I'm very supportive of this version of the school's department budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3007.843s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm looking forward to continuing to work with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3011.599s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the mayor's office with my fellow colleagues, both behind the rail and as a member of the financial task force to come up with a plan to pass a budget that meets this request and maintains level service across all of our critical areas in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=3024.952s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5382.8s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, President Pierce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5385.08s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you again for being here and for patiently answering all of our questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5389.701s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think I speak for all my fellow Councilors when I say we really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5393.542s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we recognize how hard, how hard this job is on everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5399.764s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm not a number crunching person so to me it seems even harder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5403.385s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5407.372s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's very true that we went into this fiscal year knowing that it would be really, really difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5412.393s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's because we knew that one-time funding was coming offline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5415.934s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Everybody knew that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5416.515s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We talked about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5417.175s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That was out in the open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5418.135s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We knew that we were coming into a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5419.935s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We would have to transition from a lot of really important, often critical positions being funded by this one-time funding, which is now going away because of how this national act, national grant funding worked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5433.039s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And now we're doing the work of figuring out how to transition away from that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5437.322s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I feel really confident that every player in this dynamic shares the same goal of coming out of this budget season with a budget that includes a school department appropriation that gives the school department the latitude, the ability to put that money where it is going to best support students and teachers and all school staff and families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5463.556s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I really do think that that is a value that everybody behind this realm, school committee, mayor's office, your team, administration, I think that is really shared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5476.286s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What I get out of that for me is saying, great, I support this $79.4 million recommendation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5484.452s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that sounds to me like a number that will help us achieve our shared goal of doing right by Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5494.79s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Budget seasons are hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5495.971s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is what that hard work looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5498.232s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Making recommendations and reconciling them with what's possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5503.636s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We don't get there by fighting with each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5505.597s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We get there by working together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5506.878s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I am, I think like everybody in the community, knowing for not just one year, but for several years, that there is going to be an Esser cliff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5517.305s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There being a lot of transparency around that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5520.089s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Knowing that, coming into this budget season, feeling really anxious, feeling really worried, because this is too important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5528.071s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think if we continue to collaborate and say, what can we all do so that we get as close to that number as possible, so that we don't have to cut things that we don't want to cut, that's how this should work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5540.665s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I for myself, I don't have any further questions, and I also want to reiterate, I want to leave the discussion of the line item positions and programs to the forum where those questions can be most thoroughly answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5555.717s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that's what the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5557.418s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So for myself, I don't have any further discussion points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5559.7s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't have any further questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5561.921s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have a couple other departments to hear from tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5565.424s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'll defer to my other Councilors, but I'll prefer that we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5568.326s">[Kit Collins]</a>: we move on to our next departments at this point, after this very thorough, very appreciated presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6756.245s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6758.105s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanted to say, I think that as representatives, we hear some of what people in the community are feeling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6767.328s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would never purport to hear what everybody is feeling or to know what everybody is feeling, but we all receive different trends and patterns in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6773.569s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that we can, as representatives, convey<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6779.214s">[Kit Collins]</a>: what we're hearing from members of the community, i.e.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6781.816s">[Kit Collins]</a>: about an override, without going so far as to say that we know how everybody is feeling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6788.642s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know who I've heard from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6790.523s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that based on who I've heard from, there's strong will to do what's necessary to fully fund the schools and maintain level service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6797.109s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What we're talking about is level service, not level funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6800.745s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know that other people have concerns and other Councilors have heard those as well, and both things can be true at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6805.87s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I also do just want to note, because I know that some of these concepts are new to many residents, because it's true that we haven't done an override in 45 years, that if we do an override and or a debt exclusion for both to what degree, these are questions that will go before<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6822.907s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The residents, everybody will be included in this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6825.528s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This will go on the ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6827.129s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We will have five months for everybody to be included in this process to learn about an override or debt exclusion if one is proposed and for everybody to form their own opinion about if they're going to vote for it or against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6841.216s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I just wanted to make that really clear that this is something that will be decided by popular vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=6846.758s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1760.895s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1761.215s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Leming had his hand up first, if that was a direct response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1765.856s">[Kit Collins]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1767.076s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1769.997s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Appreciate this introductory conversation on this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1774.459s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1775.099s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I arrived a little late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1775.839s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was coming from a work meeting, so there might have been some details that I missed at the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1793.422s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think I'm feeling similarly to some of my fellow Councilors and that I have a number of questions on kind of where this proposal is coming from that I would like to get some answers to before we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1807.649s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's certainly the impetus for having this kind of broader conversation about what to do about vacant storefronts is really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1814.212s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And my preference would be to continue this conversation kind of in a broader context of what in general are we doing about vacant storefronts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1822.278s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1824.352s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would like to take the time for myself to have a little bit more context of how do we quantify how many vacant storefronts are in the city?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1833.496s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What type are they?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1834.437s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Where are they?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1835.237s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is there any trends in terms of ownership or type or neighborhood?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1839.019s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is this a thing that cities typically mention by number or by density or percentage?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1844.001s">[Kit Collins]</a>: How long do they tend to be vacant for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1846.082s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think I'd like to enhance my understanding about what exactly the problem is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1853.465s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I also would love to get an expert opinion or an expert analysis of the tax incentive that we've heard of that there is to remain vacant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1862.797s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would love to get some more details about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1867.779s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think where I'm landing is that, you know, we know that vacant storefronts are an issue in the community because when we have them, people talk about it and people don't like seeing vacant storefronts where there ought to be interesting or useful businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1881.809s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I agree that there are some, I have some concerns about the unintended consequences because another thing that we hear about is when people come to Councilors and they say, why is it that we have five X style businesses in Medford Square and no,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1895.699s">[Kit Collins]</a>: there isn't a third bar or something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1898.061s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we have to say, well, it's not up to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1899.781s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think that the issue of why don't our squares have the character that we might want for them is a question that we should consider alongside this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1908.606s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In terms of what we're kind of doing here in general with the issue of vacant storefronts, I would really like to have a conversation about what, I'd like to continue the conversation that the director started about what really helps<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1925.512s">[Kit Collins]</a>: when it comes to the business community with filling vacant storefronts, figuring out what business owners need, and kind of assessing where is this mechanism kind of our list of most useful tactics and priorities?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1940.103s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And also assessing, you know, when's the right moment for something like this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1944.907s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, is this on our list of top five things to do to get storefronts filled?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1949.57s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, or should we be investigating, you know, kind of, or should we be fast tracking, um, you know, some other measures, um, you know, and continuing to prioritize the conversation of how do we as a council support getting storefronts filled, um, but perhaps spend some more time with this home rule petition and put this forward as part of a more, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1971.493s">[Kit Collins]</a>: coordinated strategy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1973.054s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm also curious to know, and I apologize, Councilor Leming, if you spoke to this earlier, if there's any sort of groundswell of cities passing this type of home rule petition, if we're kind of in that moment of motion on it, or if this is more of a gradual coming together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1991.729s">[Kit Collins]</a>: because I think in general, I think the director's point is well taken that we have to consider not just what this would potentially do, but how it will be perceived.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1999.576s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I do think it would be advantageous for us to put this forward in the context of more measures or at least underlying measures that the city is already doing, because I am concerned about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=2012.908s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm concerned about how it will be perceived if we put it forward in kind of a conversational vacuum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=2016.351s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=2455.043s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would motion to keep the paper in committee and to submit the draft of the formal petition for legal review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=2464.209s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think I missed a part of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=2465.25s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So somebody jump in if I'm forgetting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=1030.725s">[Kit Collins]</a>: this is your first budget hearing as chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=1032.566s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you so much for your service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=1034.507s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for stepping up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=1035.208s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=1036.388s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We appreciate the overview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=1038.77s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just a couple quick questions for you on my end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=1042.392s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The 123 positions budgeted for in this proposal, does that include the five firefighters that are heading to the academy in July?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=1071.93s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=1072.531s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for that clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=1077.197s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So hearing you talk about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=1079.158s">[Kit Collins]</a>: what's currently in the works and what, you know, the future forecasting for how to make the department stronger over time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=1084.121s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I feel like you're talking really a lot about pipeline, like what's our pipeline for making sure that we can work more firefighters into the operating budget going forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=1091.844s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What's our pipeline for working more of those infrastructure and fire truck costs into the operating budget going forward with parallel tracks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=1152.001s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=1152.202s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's like a lag time to all of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=1153.483s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's a lag time between appropriating for increasing hires and increasing recruitment and that actually coming to fruition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=1159.349s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's a lag time between finally, you know, 800 days later receiving that truck and then being able to put it into use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=1166.778s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Obviously, in the future, you know, I think this council shares the priority of wanting to be able to move more additional positions into the operating budget over time when our fiscal picture isn't quite so austere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=1179.344s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On the truck side, that seems to me like something that really straddles operating budget and capital plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=1185.167s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Has that been a conversation so far of kind of ramping up, you know, kind of this being an ongoing investment, working that into the city's capital improvement plans that we can be purchasing and repairing trucks<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=1215.486s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3405.82s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3406.461s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for being here and I want to also offer my congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3410.703s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's the product of a lot of hard work and I think it really shouldn't go unsaid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3414.786s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is pretty remarkable to go from having this like very, very normal municipal service be completely<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3423.26s">[Kit Collins]</a>: out of house completely contracted to bring that in house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3425.664s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's something I was always excited about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3427.387s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it's really quite amazing to see that become self-sufficient so quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3431.936s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you for your leadership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3433.078s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3434.318s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know like any major transition, it's been a rocky road at times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3437.479s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3440.1s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just really one quick question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3441.921s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know you spoke already to transitioning from some software and technological vendors to others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3447.242s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I noticed the biggest line item change was the decrease of 70,000 under professional services, financial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3454.505s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is that what you're talking about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3578.459s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well, I think that's a really exciting idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3580.2s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think the parking department, you know, how expensive it was to use an outside contractor, you know, that we're keeping that in house now that the city is, you know, these are city employees now and kind of, in a lot of ways, it's talking about return on investment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3592.41s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And wow, when you talk about getting like 12 trees donated, I think one of the many shocking things you learn behind the rail, how expensive it is to plant a single tree is one of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3601.036s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I really, I'm really excited by that creative idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3604.159s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3638.964s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3640.005s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And one more thing, I just didn't quite catch, you were talking about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3644.383s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've only got a new type of permit for vendors that are parking temporarily while they're doing work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3650.109s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is that like for contractors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3718.114s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3718.614s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3718.935s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3719.515s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate that explanation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3720.616s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And last thing I will say as a longtime resident of the GLX zone and a person who lives on a very short street, really excited for July.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=3760.132s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No, it's been in the works for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=5117.576s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=5118.317s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Not a question, just thank you for the presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=5120.938s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And as you are both as well aware as anybody, you're carrying the load for the stuff in the community that constituents notice and complain about and look forward to improvements on, as much as anybody in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=5132.846s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Same goes for your staff, everybody who's working on improving water, sewer, roads, sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=5139.058s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that alongside the year-to-year operational budget planning, there's also the long-term forecasting like you were just speaking about, Commissioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=5147.683s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you for your hard work, and we really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=5150.444s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think here we get just a glimmer of the magnitudes of planning that have to go into what actually results in improvements that we get to see around the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=5159.348s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=7980.297s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=7980.837s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Not a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=7981.458s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Appreciate this very straightforward budget, but just thanks for the work that you do year round, obviously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=7987.282s">[Kit Collins]</a>: lighting is really important to residents when they're walking around driving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=7991.025s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we see the fruits of your hard work every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=7993.507s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=7995.068s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=8926.165s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=8927.366s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's great to meet you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=8928.666s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for joining the team and I know you've heard a lot from staff I'm sure and your colleagues the city hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=8938.029s">[Kit Collins]</a>: How happy we are to have you on board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=8944.4s">[Kit Collins]</a>: full-time job, probably more like one and a half at least most of the time, but we're really happy to have you and to have you bring so much experience and enthusiasm to this role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=8954.563s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we're excited to work with you and support you however we can this election year and going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=8959.845s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have just one clarifying question on the budget before us, which I think is probably more for Nina.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=8965.746s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think you spoke to this, but if you could just run me through, I see the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=8971.078s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the decrease in salaries part-time, I see the increase in salaries seasonal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=8976.4s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If there's a short way to just explain how that all shakes out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=9012.742s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Would that be for the seasonals, for the part-time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=9048.695s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=9763.951s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=9765.312s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I really appreciate the straightforward, very legible budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=9769.378s">[Kit Collins]</a>: questions that I had on the utilities and the contractor services you already explained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=9823.791s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=9824.571s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=9828.737s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, I just missed part of what you're saying about the house doctor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=9832.019s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is that essentially like an on-call?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=9856.873s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=9857.622s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for all of your proactive work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=9918.888s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=9919.989s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You said half is funded casino mitigation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=9922.971s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's $32,000?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=9937.823s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=10058.103s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go on up here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=10068.636s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No, no, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=10076.797s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Have you already been made a co-host?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=10079.118s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's what I'm trying to figure out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=10080.598s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=10082.979s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Cancel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=10085.059s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, you are a co-host, I see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=10086.159s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I am, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=10086.579s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'll shoot you a video.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=10088.6s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll share it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=10105.344s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Share screen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=10107.886s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Solid start to an IT presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=11072.532s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for being so forthcoming about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=11074.452s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I did notice on some other budgets, so thank you for speaking to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=11077.573s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you as well for the most visual presentation of the night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=11081.234s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And no specific question for you, just it's great to hear some of the details about, in addition to the whole scope of what you're doing, a lot of the consolidation of systems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=11089.016s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is great to hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=11090.737s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Happy that we're doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=11091.617s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=11651.089s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for the presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=11652.57s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=11656.442s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't have any specific questions for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=11657.883s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just want to go on the record and state some impressions given in good faith.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=11665.326s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Obviously, it's no secret to anybody that the Council has for a couple of terms been advocating for increased capacity within our in-house legal department, and I do hear you on the breadth of experience and expertise that KP Law brings to the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=11680.157s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In many occasions, we benefited from having them as available resource.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=11683.68s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also think it's still true that they serve a different function than what we're hoping to expand in the in-house law department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=11693.689s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Obviously, keeping and maintaining the role of city solicitor and assistant city solicitor<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=11701.488s">[Kit Collins]</a>: over the long term is something that's really important to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=11704.371s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We know that this budget season, or I would say, speaking for myself, I'm also aware that this budget season is an extenuating circumstance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=11712.658s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, I think I'm still, as with the rest of the budget, you know, most of the budgets that we've received, the departmental budgets we've received, don't have any big changes, like there isn't a great change in headcount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=11722.747s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is one where there is, and I think it's gonna take me more than a day and a half to kind of absorb that and, you know, see how I feel about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=11729.538s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that that's going to come down to, you know, the context of the overall budget proposal that we receive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=11735.503s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Because of course, you know, these changes this year are all about context and making sure that we're putting resources where they're really needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=11742.069s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Of course, I'm talking about, you know, the schools and making sure that we are maintaining our baseline, you know, across the city and schools as an organization this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=11753.119s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But at the same time, you know, this feels like a big change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=11755.612s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, I know this earlier this spring, the council advocated for actually increasing the salary allocated to both city solicitor and city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=11762.659s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I do understand that if the premise is, why don't we nix both?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=11767.223s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a compromise from that starting position, but from the starting position of we want to be competitive with other cities to fill both positions, this is a pretty big change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=11776.031s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just wanted to put that out there for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=11777.532s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, that's how I'm absorbing this proposed change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=11782.159s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and I also, you know, like I said, just to reiterate, I think that as with anything this year, it's gonna come down to the context of the overall budget that we're passing this year and our plans for how we're going to fill gaps citywide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=11800.812s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=12534.548s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=12535.148s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And again, not to belabor any points, but just I think this is obviously an ongoing conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=12541.428s">[Kit Collins]</a>: conversations about any changes to any departmental budget, don't open and close and leave preliminary budget hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=12546.409s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's one advantage of this new structure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=12548.81s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have many more opportunities to talk about this, to discuss and negotiate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=12552.89s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think one, I think something that's come up for me even just in this one meeting, which I think has been useful and clear in the way that many department heads are thinking about their budgets and the way that we're thinking about the organizational budget overall is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=12569.298s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What are we investing in and what's the return that we get from those investments?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=12572.859s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know in a year where there's a really emergent need, that conversation gets a lot harder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=12579.26s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we're trying to fill a multi-million gap for the schools and contemplate all possible solutions for doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=12587.782s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that we have to be talking about all of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=12591.822s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I wouldn't want, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=12596.718s">[Kit Collins]</a>: what a well-resourced city council is able to do for the city in the short and long term to fall out of that discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=12606.842s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Even just thinking about the plans that we have for this year and where I think we're fairly well supported right now on one of our three major, one of our major projects being the zoning overhaul because of the zoning consultant that we do have the resources for for the rest of this fiscal year and the next one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=12622.847s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But we also are going to be working on a city charter<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=12627.148s">[Kit Collins]</a>: especially we're talking about the context of a major budget shortfall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=12631.729s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One of the few things that this council has direct influence over is making the zoning decisions that affect business development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=12641.611s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That could be one of the pieces of solving our budget deficit for the longer term so we don't keep coming back and having budget discussions like these when we're trying to fill gaps and trying to cut things that really shouldn't be cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=12654.508s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so I hope that, I think this is one of the first, apart from the schools, this is one of the first really major consequential, in my opinion, cuts that has been proposed this budget season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=12667.178s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I don't think that we should, I think that as we contemplate it, we need to consider what we're leaving on the table by not continuing to try to empower the city council with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=12684.329s">[Kit Collins]</a>: this piece of the puzzle when it comes to our legal representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=12687.27s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And again, I feel that me and my fellow Councilors who have been on for more than one term have a different perspective on this than folks who have been here for less time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=12695.791s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I understand that there's a difference, and this doesn't take it all away from what KP Law provides, because everything that you said I think is totally true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=12706.013s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think it's also true that having legal representation that is really for the council is different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=12714.056s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and is responsible to the council in a way that is different, that is accountable to the council's goals, in a way that is distinct from the type of service that KP law provides, and not to say that that in any way diminishes what they do, but just to flesh out the points that I was making previously, because I know sometimes I can be a little abstract, and I just, you know, since this is the first time where<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=12739.278s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilman Singh, this proposed change in public, I just wanted to put that out there for the record of some of what's on my mind as we consider this cut as part of the package that we try to make to cut our way to resolving that deficit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=12753.201s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And what gives me hope is knowing that there are a lot of other solutions that we can, and I know that people are contemplating for how to arrive at a solution that at least<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=12765.842s">[Kit Collins]</a>: all of the critical functions that the city provides, continuing to provide great service for residents and students and teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=12773.447s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I look forward to continuing that work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=12776.028s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=9.0s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Present<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=501.669s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=502.43s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=503.55s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you other board members and trustees for being here as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=507.132s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Appreciate this presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=510.333s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also know me and several other Councilors were able to take you up on the invitation to attend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=515.538s">[Kit Collins]</a>: a public trustees meeting several weeks ago, maybe last month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=520.501s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Really appreciate the dialogue about where the library is at and the budgeting process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=526.124s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I say this about a lot of departments, but I really like these hearings for being able to just shine an extra spotlight on the work that the library is doing, that the work that the department is doing year round.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=536.049s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know during budget time, conversation is often like, what do we have to take to get what is on offer to the community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=543.951s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And the library is such an excellent example of what the community is getting out of the work that we're investing in, especially when you're talking about the programming that isn't even inside of the operating budget, but offers so much to, in many cases, the people in Medford who really need the most.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=557.619s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Something like ESL classes, I know that was such a need to be within Medford City boundaries for such a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=564.043s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So it's just very special to hear of this and other programming going on in the building now that we do have the new building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=571.004s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know that moving into the new building has been kind of one of the central pieces of the library narrative over the past few years, going from that sort of artificially smaller budget during the interim space to now try to, you know, funding for the big, beautiful, modern, contemporary building that the library is now in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=588.878s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that was certainly a conversation last year and something that we'll be continuing to work through over the next few years to make sure that the library is supported to really be operating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=598.661s">[Kit Collins]</a>: at full capacity and bring that full capacity into the operating budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=602.762s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that's just a note of acknowledgement and thanks to you and all the work that's going on behind the scenes all year round to make this such a useful space for the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=623.746s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well, that's great to hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=624.646s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=625.167s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know it's been put to really good use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=628.188s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have just one small question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=629.849s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know we've talked about this in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=633.33s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that there was some of the part-time workers at the library, there was kind of a talk of a raise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=639.833s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There hadn't been a raise in several years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=641.734s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The under-fixed costs, the increase that was mentioned, the part-time pay increase for hourly part-time, does that cover the proposed raise, or is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=671.153s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=672.894s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I'm so glad that we're bringing up that baseline this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=677.495s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Do you know off the top of your head, what is the amount of the raise per hour?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=682.737s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=683.632s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=684.332s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2233.441s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't have any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2235.303s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Very straightforward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2236.143s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2236.924s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But thank you so much for coming here every year and walking us through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2928.038s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just wanted to say between things like the Post Commission and now FlexPost, you truly are working in an evolving field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=2933.16s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you again for your service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=2081.042s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I found them in order and I move for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=2257.184s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We met with the council zoning consultant and our discussion centered on updating some of the critical definitions that have been flagged for updating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=2266.29s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We also discussed the timeline of the project over the next several months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=2270.373s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=2541.16s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=2543.883s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=2547.306s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would motion to suspend the rules to take 24-355 and then 24-100.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=2938.166s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=2939.266s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you also, Attorney Austin, for being with us tonight and also for your work on this matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=2946.968s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have reviewed this complaint with Attorney Austin prior to this meeting, being the party that was named specifically in the complaint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=2955.71s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know that she and her colleagues have reviewed this and reviewed my Reddit post in question very thoroughly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=2962.412s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was pleased to read their very thoroughly researched response and their<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=2967.932s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They're finding that that does not constitute an OML violation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=2973.154s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I myself have, you know, looked over the draft response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=2976.575s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've given it some time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=2978.016s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm comfortable submitting this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=2979.676s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think the response is thorough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=2980.777s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's adequate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=2981.357s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It backs up all the relevant points, which are that the Reddit post in question contained no open meeting law violation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=2990.08s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I will indulge myself to say that as an elected, as the named party in the complaint,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=2994.915s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I am fully aware and respectful of the fact that the things that I say might not always be popular, but I know that always doesn't necessarily equate with a rule or regulation being broken, and I appreciate having legal clarity around the difference between those two things and the attorney's attention to detail in helping us articulate what the Reddit posts, what my Reddit posts did and did not include.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3020.965s">[Kit Collins]</a>: forward a motion to acknowledge the complaint and approve this draft response after my fellow Councilors have had time to review and ask any questions that they might have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3031.332s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I have more I could say on the topic, but I think that the top lines are, you know, for myself as an elected, when I first gained office, I immediately researched the open meeting law to make sure that I understood it, understood the parameters, the point of open meeting law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3044.838s">[Kit Collins]</a>: is to ensure that all issues of public import that are before a public body only ever take place among a quorum of that body in public session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3053.761s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's so that the community can be there whenever a quorum of that body is debating things that are important to the community, things that are public matters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3062.304s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I take that really seriously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3063.305s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's a really important rule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3065.606s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have open meetings for a reason, and those conversations should happen in open meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3070.407s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do these Reddit posts to be informative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3072.448s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Community members have asked me to do them because I think it is understandably really hard to keep up with the nuts and bolts of what's going on in City Council and elsewhere in City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3082.35s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that was the intent of these Reddit posts, continues to be to just be informative, to share these on a popular online platform that people use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3089.722s">[Kit Collins]</a>: not to be a forum for debate amongst members of the body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3094.543s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And, you know, of course, I appreciate, you know, the opportunity for a legal mind to take a look and say, I confirm there is no deliberation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3103.345s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's never my intent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3104.446s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that has never been the case in the post that I have been sharing on Reddit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3110.167s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you, Attorney Austin and my fellow Councilors for their time in considering this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3862.179s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was going to make a similar motion to table or convene in planning and permitting to determine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4247.294s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4248.976s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Laurel, for being on the call tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4251.698s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Last Wednesday in Committee of the Whole, we had a more detailed presentation about all of the proposals for how to allocate our block grant funding for the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4261.446s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it's great to see that that number has increased a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4264.348s">[Kit Collins]</a>: None of the final figures have been released.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4267.41s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know for myself as one councilor, I really appreciated the detail into what that grant funding is doing in our community this year and hearing about some of the previous grantees just building on and continuing the work that they do in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4279.975s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And most of that work is directed at serving the neediest and most marginalized members of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4286.137s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's always great to hear about how those funds are getting spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4289.138s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I know we have to open the hearing, but I would motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4649.699s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4650.039s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I don't have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4650.799s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanted to say I appreciate the flexibility on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4653.02s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that this is a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4655.114s">[Kit Collins]</a>: very reasonable proposal, and I appreciate that the petitioner was willing to have conversations with Councilor Scarpelli, Throat Enforcement, and the neighbors to come back with something that I hope will indeed help your business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4666.061s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Also, maybe some of those neighbor concerns just because of the behavior of delivery drivers as we're in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4672.986s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5248.336s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for being here today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5249.898s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Appreciate you reaching out to members of the council last week to let us know this was coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5255.444s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just to paraphrase a lot of what you just presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5259.525s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's great to see a petition come before us, and we know that the building has already been renovated from, and as people know, I was a Tufts University student back in the day, so I've seen a lot of hovels on or near campus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5273.133s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's great to see this one rehabilitated and densified, and that it's already gone through all the necessary procedures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5281.579s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's, as one Councilor, that's what I like to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5285.181s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We appreciate Tufts investing in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5287.278s">[Kit Collins]</a>: housing more tough students near or even better on campus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5291.086s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you so much for this bona fide good project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5294.995s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5296.037s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to approve after we open the hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5671.869s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5674.451s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This was tabled from our last regular meeting because the report in the packet missed the crucial first two pages, which differentiated this report from a separate report, which was the annual surveillance report submitted by city agencies that use surveillance technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5694.844s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In contrast, this is the City Council's reporting requirement under the Community Control over Public Surveillance Ordinance, which passed in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5705.851s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5735.443s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We passed this somewhat proactively and that there isn't a lot of surveillance technology currently being used by the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5741.727s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, at the time of the passage of the C cops ordinance, there's only one surveillance technology being used by the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5747.63s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It was by the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5748.651s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's body worn cameras.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5750.312s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um in hashing out the details of the ordinance in, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5758.837s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We exempted body-worn cameras from some of the reporting requirements and oversight requirements and approval requirements to which all new surveillance technologies will be subject.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5772.948s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Other main things to know about the ordinance under it, if a new surveillance technology comes before the council, or if a new technology is proposed to be used, it will come before the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5781.687s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the council will discuss it, hold public meetings, ask questions about how much it will cost, what are the pros, what are the cons, what is the use for which this is being proposed, and then make a determination, do we approve this use, or do we deny it, or do we ask for changes to the proposed policy in order to approve it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5798.253s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This annual public report is something that the city council owes to the community to say, in the preceding calendar year,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5807.316s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These are all the requests for new surveillance technology that were approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5810.959s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These are all the new requests for surveillance technology that were denied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5814.221s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These are all the requests that we made changes to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5817.043s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And here are all of the annual surveillance reports that we received from the departments that actually use them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5822.847s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that is why this report is so short.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5825.549s">[Kit Collins]</a>: because we made no approval in 2023.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5827.37s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We made no approvals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5828.59s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We made no rejections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5829.571s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We made no changes, and that is because the only surveillance technology being used in the city in 2023, which, in fact, was only for, I think, about three weeks in December, was the body-worn cameras.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5839.395s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And per the ordinance that we passed earlier that year, body-worn cameras are exempted from City Council approval process until 2028.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5847.998s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5850.677s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This report just sums all of that up, and it also includes a copy of the annual surveillance report on body-worn cameras that the Medford Police Department submitted to us, and we discussed in a meeting of the Public Health and Community Safety Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5866.446s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that's the brief report that we're looking at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=1.923s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There will be a meeting of the Medford City Council Planning and Permitting Committee, May 8th, 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=6.164s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This meeting will take place at 6 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=9.025s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in the City Council Chamber, second floor, Medford City Hall, 85 George P. Hassett Drive, Medford MA, and via Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=16.567s">[Kit Collins]</a>: To submit written comments, please email ahertabase at edfordma.gov.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=22.089s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=34.827s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=41.811s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Five present, none absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=43.272s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The meeting is called to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=45.753s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The action and discussion item for this meeting is paper 24-033 zoning ordinance updates with the Innes Associates team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=57.7s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, so I will just quickly summarize our agenda for this meeting, and then I'll turn it over to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=64.083s">[Kit Collins]</a>: our zoning consultant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=66.444s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Per the plan that we agreed upon at the last time we met with our zoning consultant in the planning and permitting committee, which I believe was just two weeks ago, we decided that we would use this next meeting to review the updated zoning memo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=81.751s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I understand that we have some draft text for updating the definitions in our zoning ordinance, and I want to just take that opportunity to restate at this point<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=90.558s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think that we're talking about making any substantial changes to the definitions or the use table, but rather taking this opportunity to modernize, incorporate suggestions for city staff for making these definitions more legible, more useful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=107.705s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we can review that, as well as the updated table of uses, which again, no substantive changes, just changing the formatting to be more useful, more readable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=120.355s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're then going to switch over into discussing some zoning strategies that are recommended in the climate action and adaptation plan and seeing how those fit into our kind of work plan for the zoning overhaul overall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=137.18s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And go into what we are planning to do in our next meeting two weeks from now to move all of these projects forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=144.262s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So with that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=146.937s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Barring any introductory comments from Councilors, I would love to hand it over to Paula.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=151.681s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=192.317s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If you could just, sorry, if you could put the microphone a little bit closer to your face.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=196.16s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There you go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=196.701s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=450.776s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=451.056s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On the use table, just while we're looking at it, if you want, I'm going back to that slide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=454.718s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for flagging that the multiple dwelling class A and multiple dwelling class B. So it's my understanding that definition might change, and that's why it's highlighted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=465.123s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On the right-hand side, highlighted in yellow, we have the column PC and the column LC.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=470.805s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Would you mind just quickly defining the column headers, what PC and LC stand for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=475.487s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's parking code and then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=511.691s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So it's just putting it all in the same table so you don't have to be flipping through and trying to match.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=515.781s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=515.981s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=516.943s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=737.844s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Paul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=738.364s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm going to go to Councilor Leming, and then I think I saw a hand from Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=1014.386s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=1015.307s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Callahan, did I see a hand up from you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=1017.128s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Nope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=1017.468s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=1018.849s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any other comments on councilors on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=1024.053s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, did we even let you get into really the meat of the discussion on dwelling multifamily or cut you off at the beginning there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=1383.663s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would say, if I may, just to reinforce, I think that we have a lot of definitions to update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=1388.206s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that some of these are still under review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=1390.067s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that on some, there was a recommendation to run them by the building department for further input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=1394.99s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also know that we're trying to move things along efficiently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=1398.792s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're also trying to bundle things so that it's not a constant stream of zoning updates through the city council to the CDB.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=1405.256s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But that being said, we have a lot to work through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=1408.362s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any thoughts that can be at least preliminarily aired at this meeting, the sooner we can get out all of our discussion topics and work through them towards a resolution, the better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=1417.486s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think I'm really glad that you flagged that, Planner Evans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=1421.027s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that if we're, I'd like for us to be contemplating something like dwelling multi-household, even if there is an asterisk somewhere in the definition, because towards the goal of consistency, if we're trying to eradicate that elsewhere in our zoning language, I think we should be doing that from the top.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=1437.657s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=2258.939s">[Kit Collins]</a>: While we're looking, I just want to recognize Attorney Silverstein who might be able to chime in on this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=2378.99s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I also just want to note, you know, I know that there's many other definitions on this document today that have research outstanding that your team is still looking into that we're waiting for feedback on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=2391.683s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Before we move on to the next one, I just want to pause, I know that we might have been like hot on the trail of a couple<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=2397.298s">[Kit Collins]</a>: thoughts to follow up on, I'm happy to give this a couple more minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=2400.101s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do feel fairly confident this is one of the more complicated ones on our document today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=2404.327s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that this discussion will take up the bulk of our time, regardless of if it's at the beginning or the end, but I'm happy to defer to the enthusiasm of this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=2414.579s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If we come back to it, go for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=2560.369s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I am coming into the meeting with kind of framing a similar question in my mind, because it's my impression that we have parts of this first bucket that are easily reportable and then others that are still not pending, but there's like one or two small steps that still need to be made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=2578.163s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Like it's my understanding, for example, that the table of uses is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=2581.59s">[Kit Collins]</a>: updated, things have been swapped in, that's good to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=2583.491s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The definitions, I think some of these are easy, some of them are not, some of them are just waiting for feedback on, so that's kind of half and half.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=2591.455s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The GIS zoning map is something that I think could possibly also be part of that first packet, and I'm not sure the status on that, so I think it's a question of do we want to, do we wanna pass something through the council, CD back to the council, that then kind of has a second half that's a couple weeks behind it, or should we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=2612.199s">[Kit Collins]</a>: have this discussion and wait until we can package all of the definitions together with the table of uses, maybe with site plan review, if that's ready in a couple of weeks, and the GIS zoning map.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=2625.386s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think one of our earlier conversations was around CDB capacity for not trying to load the schedule with multiple meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=2634.371s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that is kind of, to me, that's part of the decision on my mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=2905.932s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Packager?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=2906.752s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=2907.373s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=2907.773s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I mean, I certainly am very sympathetic to not wanting to deliver a gigantic packet for review all in one meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=2914.736s">[Kit Collins]</a>: At the same time, I think, also thinking about keeping this coherent for residents that are following along in this process, I like the idea of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=2925.339s">[Kit Collins]</a>: getting through the definitions, even if it takes a couple of meetings, and then updating the definitions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=2929.6s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it'd be an overreach to say in one fell swoop, but doing that in one meeting as opposed to two, along with the use, the GIS, the site plan review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=2937.702s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that keeps us with our goal of getting those pieces dispensed with prior to the end of the fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=2944.424s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think it would be a great start to hit that, to do that as one package.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=2950.165s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Callahan, I think I saw your hand go up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=2955.595s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In that case, I would recommend that maybe we rest on the, for now, dwelling multifamily definition, since we're going to, I think, it'd be advantageous to get some proposals back from Innes Associates in two weeks based on this discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=2972.511s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we should come back to this at the end of the meeting, but for now, I would recommend that we put a pin in this, work our way through some of these other definitions,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=2981.254s">[Kit Collins]</a>: enjoy the ones that are a little bit simpler and then maybe come back at the end of the meeting to this and any other definitions that are a little bit stickier and figure out exactly what we want to request of the consultant in terms of our next steps for reviewing this in two weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=2995.966s">[Kit Collins]</a>: How's that sound?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=2998.728s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=2999.649s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let's go to doggie daycare.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3005.939s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3006.339s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sorry before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3007.24s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sorry to cut you off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3008.541s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Attorney Silverstein, is your hand up for before or do you have a comment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3045.989s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3046.65s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3047.67s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any additional context before we go to comments from councillors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3055.833s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3075.336s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's not the definition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3076.677s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Never mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3078.498s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But we could change that tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3081.08s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3098.386s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I certainly don't have a position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3133.375s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I understand that this is one of those terms that did not have a definition, so we're imposing one for the first time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3138.457s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3139.172s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3141.273s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't have any questions on this one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3144.596s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any further questions from fellow councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3148.919s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, and this will remain dog daycare unless there is a motion to change it to doggy daycare, because dog daycare is what is in the suggestion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3159.006s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I leave it to you, my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3161.267s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Moving on, quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3170.253s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Or I guess I'm sorry, that doesn't need to be a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3174.897s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't believe that has to be a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3176.318s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3195.694s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3196.014s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let's move along to number three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3197.415s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3685.542s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I mean, it also strikes me, and I apologize for cutting you off, but on the same thread, I think one way to look into this is like, when is the question coming up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3696.908s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know what I often hear is people having a legitimate concern about,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3701.266s">[Kit Collins]</a>: safety when it comes to number of people in a house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3703.327s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, there were those very high profile tragedies like maybe a decade ago at this point about overcrowded housing in student areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3709.95s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Obviously, we don't want to, I don't think that these rules are widely abused, but we don't want to create loopholes where people feel there is an invitation to as many people as want can live in this house and people are sleeping in attics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3724.518s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Obviously, that's not the intent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3729.002s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think like maybe one way of asking this question, it's like, where is this coming up in City Hall?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3734.805s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Like, when is this question coming to us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3741.888s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And from there, is it the number of occupants that we ought to try to define and then regulate because that regulation is being negotiated or is it the size of the building?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3985.187s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's a really helpful illustration of some of what we're talking around here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3991.75s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What's on my mind after that kind of example, and I'm trying to think of how to phrase this, because I think it's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4000.725s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's widely known, I care a lot about tenant protections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4003.807s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I'm wondering if there's some parallel between overcrowding not being what we're solving for in zoning and that type, obviously we're trying not to create zoning definitions that invite in bad behavior or things to take advantage of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4020.918s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But in the same way, I don't want to overcorrect for problems that are also<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4027.884s">[Kit Collins]</a>: shouldn't be adjudicated through zoning, but should be adjudicated through a supportive service that City Hall offers, whether it's Board of Health or the Housing Planner or the multilingual support line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4041.497s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Do you know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4236.764s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4448.544s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that approach could make sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4449.825s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was thinking along similar lines that it strikes me that some of the concerns that were<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4454.625s">[Kit Collins]</a>: talking about here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4455.345s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think just to lay the foundation first, I think it's, I feel pretty comfortable with the current definition as is for the moment while we're contemplating this bigger question, because I think that does still reflect the intent of the council and city staff in allowing people to define for themselves what their household is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4473.774s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I do have some, I will admit I have some skepticism about our ability to frame zoning language in a way that helps us get at the enforcement piece of when that is taken advantage of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4482.318s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do think it gets into that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4485.519s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It gets into that issue that we have been talking about mainly with the short-term rentals, where this is more an enforcement issue and building up our capacity to run down those complaints when property owners are doing things with their property that they're not allowed to do, and making sure that tenants or boarders are okay and get the support that they need in those cases where that is happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4506.088s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so I think that in terms of the definition, it makes sense to consider this alongside other more similar<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4513.157s">[Kit Collins]</a>: definitions like the boarding house, the dormitory, and I think the rest of it might get into a conversation that's slightly outside of the scope of zoning, or at least blurs outside of the scope of zoning, such as with, of course, the complaints about, the fears about overcrowding of parking on residential streets, and when homes are becoming busier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4537.108s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's familiar to all of us, and for example, one way the city has been thinking about addressing that is through<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4543.109s">[Kit Collins]</a>: mechanisms like zoned parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4545.09s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think there's some latitude that we have in zoning and there's others that we have through other mechanisms that kind of go alongside it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4606.064s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4609.166s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Also worth noting that occasionally individual rooms are rented out, and that's wanted and desired and unproblematic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4615.58s">[Kit Collins]</a>: older brother was a Medford resident for a long time in a situation like that, so just to state that for the record as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4622.764s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it makes sense to consider, you know, what's the language that captured, I think that this language captures our current intent comfortably.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4631.089s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And maybe there's a new definition to add to the roster to capture this one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4641.075s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any additional comments on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4644.758s">[Kit Collins]</a>: household.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4645.318s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This has been a fruitful conversation, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4652.962s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4654.363s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll suggest we move on unless there's any additional comments from Councilors on household.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4726.218s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this is to ask an obvious question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4728.358s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this is specifically for incorporated nonprofits use of land and lots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4737.1s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any comments or questions by Councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4744.681s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And again, this was an existing use that simply did not have a definition previously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4754.683s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4757.122s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, not seeing any comments from fellow councillors, we can move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4785.825s">[Kit Collins]</a>: for me, this one looks good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4787.006s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that this follows with our principle of letting definitions be definitions and not imposing additional standards that might get us into the weeds where it's not helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4943.162s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Initial questions from councillors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4954.485s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so just to clarify, I noticed suggested definitions for sort of differentiating manufactured homes versus tiny houses and keeping the current definition for mobile home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5050.123s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5050.844s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So there's a new definition for manufactured, a new definition for tiny and movable, new definition for tiny and stationary, and then the existing definition for mobile home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5062.955s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5063.656s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What was, I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5065.017s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You mentioned suggesting a deletion in tiny homes that are movable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5069.842s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Was that just removing the standards for use out of the definition?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5073.225s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5073.866s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5083.567s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And is that reflected in the suggested definition?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5085.93s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All of the standards for use already encapsulates what was taken out of the suggested definition?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5091.616s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Or are there more details that you suggest to remove from the suggested definition for a movable tiny house?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5548.797s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Certainly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5549.417s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And before we cap off the discussion of this definition, I would say I think it dovetails nicely because I think one of our many motivations for getting through, maybe we're stretching the definition of all this being low-hanging fruit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5563.227s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But one of the motivations for getting through the low-hanging fruit by the end of this fiscal year so that we can get into<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5569.727s">[Kit Collins]</a>: those themes of great substance outlined in the climate action adaptation plan, the housing production plan, after we dispense with this kind of update round.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5580.731s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So it would be great to, in this process, pass some definitions that we can then consider in the context of implementing the HPP, infill, zoning, and many other mechanisms when we're getting into those kind of topic areas later in the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5595.096s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think this is very proactive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5599.446s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any additional comments on manufactured, mobile, and teeny tiny homes before we move on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5607.727s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Loewen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5634.573s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that we can talk about this at the end of the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5637.414s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I believe that on the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5638.598s">[Kit Collins]</a>: draft agenda was to propose to have an initial discussion about the proposed ADU ordinance in two weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5646.241s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So certainly none of these definitions will be codified by then, but I certainly don't see why we can't be having these discussions in parallel since, of course, the ADU ordinance is not something that we're going to report out in one meeting anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5704.146s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5704.546s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5704.947s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I appreciate that clarity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5710.631s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5711.072s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, let's see what's next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5808.639s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing none, appreciate the collaboration with the building commissioner on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5816.223s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Of course, as we've stated before, part of the goal of this is to just clear up areas of known confusion and roadblocks in how the zoning ordinance is currently used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5826.207s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So it's great to be able to incorporate his feedback that this is causing problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5829.549s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The definition would help smooth things out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5836.212s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Shall we move on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5865.681s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5866.021s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think you mentioned on the previous slide that one<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5869.946s">[Kit Collins]</a>: defining this was mainly to be able to prohibit them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5873.308s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Could you speak more to that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5884.333s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5964.004s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5969.125s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's helpful context for this change here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5973.387s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any additional comments at this time on junkyards or automobile graveyards?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5980.106s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing none, let's move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=6015.953s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so the suggestion here, just to paraphrase what you just said, is to keep our current definition but pull out those dimensional standards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=6031.457s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any comments or questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=6036.339s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=6188.562s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Wait, I am so sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=6189.662s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm going to need you to repeat that one more time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=6192.063s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have accessory structure, accessory use, and accessory, which are being kept and which are moving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=6199.286s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That is new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=6206.78s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The existing definition of accessory is becoming the definition for accessory use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=6255.971s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=6256.571s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That will help clarify.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=6266.266s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any additional comments on accessory structure and accessory use?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=6275.091s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Director Hunt, did you have something?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=6542.084s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that takes us from our discussion of various accessories to actually move on to the replacement of coverage of lot with lot coverage and adding accessory buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=6602.272s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The question is whether to have it exclude unenclosed porches and bay windows or to have those be included?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=6608.375s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=6863.459s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So it seems like the question is we could refer this up and correct me if I've misheard, perhaps refer out to building for their assessment on if this change would reduce buildability or if it wouldn't make a difference in the interim based on how they're currently interpreting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=6885.502s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm open to other approaches.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=6902.548s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It would make sense to lump by scene if we revisit this with dimensionals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=6911.736s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Would it be possible to make a note of that somewhere in our work plan so that we don't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=6929.116s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I will make a note of that as well for updating our work plan and memo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7037.927s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, well that takes us to the end of our review of the definitions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7042.189s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know I was trying to flag as we went through the ones that were clarified at the outset that this is still under review, there's still research being done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7051.773s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I flagged a few items where we want to add a piece of homework for NS Associates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7062.838s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For example, we want to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7065.56s">[Kit Collins]</a>: try to capture our conversation about the multifamily dwellings to come back with kind of a more comprehensive proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7080.723s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Ditto, I think, for our discussion of household, though I don't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7091.994s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't know if we arrived at a resolution in our conversation about household, if we are trying to advance something in two weeks, or if that's a conversation that we're going to put aside, I think, when we're developing new uses and are kind of more... I think that I liked a lot what President Zuckerberg said, to have a bunch of all these definitions together and all the...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7239.163s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think our organizing principle here, which I think is a really good one, is to be bundling things by category.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7244.987s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And in this case, sometimes that category is what's just an easy definition that we know how it should be improved and let's improve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7252.295s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that we have some kind of outstanding items from this list where it just needs a little more feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7256.779s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It just needs a little more research.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7258.62s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let's bundle those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7259.521s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let's get all of the ones that we kind of flagged this week is still under review, or there's like a little bit more that we need to think about here, but it's mostly bite-sized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7268.428s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let's plan to come back on the 22nd, review that language, have it ready to go, and be able to refer it out to the council so we can begin that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7279.275s">[Kit Collins]</a>: household conversation, the thing where it's more of an interrogation of what do we really want here, and a lot of coverage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7286.279s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I am very happy to support, you know, making that its own mini package for later in the process and not coming up the works on the easier definitions with those more substantive conversations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7386.574s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So any last comments on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7390.756s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7391.736s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we have our next steps on the definitions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7394.097s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We know that when we vote out the definitions, we will also vote out the table of uses, because that is essentially ready to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7402.18s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just to kind of tie up on the things that we're expecting for next time, also site plan review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7411.903s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would love a status update on inclusionary zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7416.053s">[Kit Collins]</a>: kind of a first look at ADUs, possibly the mapping analysis work plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7421.036s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Does that, just before we move on to kind of a first review of the policies from the Climate Action Plan, does that encapsulate what we're expecting for the 22nd definitions, table review, site plan review?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7432.742s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Do we feel that the GIS zoning map is possible to have two weeks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7534.433s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's like, that's the package that we're... That's the package that we're hoping to have in hand on the 22nd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7541.354s">[Kit Collins]</a>: full comprehensive draft language or visuals, as the case may be, so that we can vote it out on the 22nd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7546.796s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then I think there's some additional topics that we're going to be talking about for perhaps the first time, but not voting out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7612.062s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7612.622s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, I didn't catch that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7614.723s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7615.523s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is it feeling...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7618.499s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is it still realistic to expect proposable language for site plan review in Dover on the 22nd?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7838.781s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7839.241s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Certainly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7839.681s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7840.122s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think, in general, there's clearly a compelling reason for moving that forward quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7845.745s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I feel that my role in this process is to be trying to, everything that we know what our intent is, we know what our goals are, we have a reasonable expectation of what our stumbling blocks are, I would like to see move through as quickly as possible because we have such an ambitious work plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7859.893s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So for things like site plan review,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7862.866s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the use table, the definitions where we kind of know what we're after.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7866.827s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, it's great to be able to see that, you know, kind of complete proposed language in two weeks' time so that we can get the ball rolling on that and then proceed on towards our many large and more complicated projects under this ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7885.19s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just to recap for next meeting, that's the use table, all definitions except for the two that we decided to separate out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7891.633s">[Kit Collins]</a>: existing map digitized site plan review, including Dover, adding the definition or, you know, including the definition of government use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7901.575s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know for this meeting we also intended to review strategies from the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7909.596s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also know that it's 8.15 and Councilor Callahan has had to depart and I know that this is an area of interest for her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7919.518s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What was that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7925.148s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So maybe there is a... I wonder if there's a middle path here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7931.631s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that thinking about what we're hoping to report out at our next meeting and the topics that we were hoping to raise for the first time between this meeting and next meeting, that being the climate action policies and inclusionary zoning, ADUs, the mapping analysis work plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7949.698s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's kind of like four new buckets that we were hoping to propose between tonight<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7953.232s">[Kit Collins]</a>: next time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7953.672s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I love an ambitious timeline, but I'm not sure what we would get out of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7966.221s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Having looked through the packet, there are a lot of climate-related policies suggested in the Climate Action Adaptation Plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7972.705s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Obviously that's what it is, and I think maybe it's worth rethinking when to have that conversation so that we can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7980.14s">[Kit Collins]</a>: report out some actionable items given that we've been meeting for a couple of hours already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=7990.462s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that a priority for me, I want to make sure that we do start having that conversation of what from the cap are we prioritizing and what's going where certainly in May so that that can be informing our discussion of like what big topics are we diving into after our kind of June 30th deadline for our first bucket.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8012.239s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So if we're actually, Paola, I took you off of screen sharing because we were just discussing, but if you wouldn't mind pulling up that, I think it was just one of the very first slides again that lays out our timeline for the rest of May and June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8023.794s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is that possible?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8067.74s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What in zoning is already in our memo?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8070.982s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then comparing that to the large list of policies suggested in the cap,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8215.427s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Certainly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8216.228s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8216.588s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Appreciate that overview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8220.81s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Given that, I'm looking at an even earlier slide, the timeline for our upcoming collaborations in this committee with you and the team, and just thinking about where it makes sense to have that discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8235.092s">[Kit Collins]</a>: it makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8235.613s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we'll have a more productive conversation coming and having sifted what's already in the work plan, what's already in the works, and what's left out that should be added to the list of priorities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8246.701s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So would you mind pulling up the timeline so we're... I think it's like slide number two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8257.008s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just in terms of where to have this discussion most effectively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8261.372s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8262.315s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're at May 8 right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8263.816s">[Kit Collins]</a>: May 22, we're going to look at and report out definitions, use table, digital map, site plan review, including Dover language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8277.603s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we have, I think, three new topics to surface at that meeting as well, between mapping analysis, inclusionary zoning, and ADUs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8285.346s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I wonder if it makes sense to give all these topics a little bit of breathing room, maybe<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8291.038s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Our June 12th committee meeting can be revisiting those three topics brought up for the first time, May 22nd, after we report out everything that we've already spoken about tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8300.98s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And June 12th can be kind of a first attempt, our first conversation about surfacing priorities from the climate policies and making sure that those are added to the work plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8312.702s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just in terms of sort of revising our next steps in the flow of these meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8539.966s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8540.346s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think in these meetings, we've been kind of trending there organically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8543.99s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think, you know, to the extent that we can absolutely, I think to see the extent that we can plan for that, we'll just, we're already picking up momentum as we go along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8552.538s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think planning for that will help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8555.661s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think ideally, you know, we obviously from the outset, we've been aligned in the goal of passing like things at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8562.547s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8563.803s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Right now, that's kind of procedural.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8564.963s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're talking about definitions, we're talking about tables.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8567.324s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then as we get past June, that'll be around goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8570.425s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so aligning things by goal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8571.725s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we can have a couple meetings in June, I think, to go through the climate plan and the comp plan to build on the work that you've already been doing with the memos to make sure that those are aligned by outcome and goal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8583.068s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then we can just meet by topic over the summer and into the fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8592.699s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Inclusionary, ADUs, and I think the mapping analysis is the other piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8662.531s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, no, I completely agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8665.233s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think maybe between, uh, we know what we're doing in terms of the things we're going to report out at our next meeting and maybe between now and then, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8672.898s">[Kit Collins]</a>: we and staff and NS can be talking about for the second half of that meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8676.399s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What makes sense?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8676.92s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Should we keep inclusionary ADUs, mapping analysis?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8679.941s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are we teed up for that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8680.781s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is that easy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8681.482s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Or should we shift to going over one of the, like having the climate plan conversation that we didn't have tonight, the second half of that meeting instead, or the comp plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8692.846s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then so that we are moving things into those sequences, into those folders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8699.5s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But that's not, I'm not putting, you don't have to answer the question right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8701.703s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's just maybe something for us to consider as we're developing the agenda for two weeks from now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8706.108s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We already have a great sled of work though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8708.471s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are going to be reporting out of that meeting and that's a great start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8710.994s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then we can just be thinking about as we're sort of closing a door and opening a door in every meeting, what's the door that we want to open at that meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8772.965s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, no, I think that that, um, I think that will work well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8780.674s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for truly co-creating this process with us as you are helping us with our zoning process and the outcomes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8792.624s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that leaves us with a great plan for next time, certainly a decent amount of work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8797.728s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you in advance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8801.931s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Excited to get the ball rolling on our first zoning votes to come in this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8806.295s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's pretty exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8812.125s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we're pretty well set on our next steps and pieces that we're looking to Innis for, for our next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8819.528s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are there any final comments or motions from Councilors other than what we've already discussed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8831.852s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing none, just want to thank you again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8833.193s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8834.933s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Director Hunt, for being here and to the Innis team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8837.454s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know there's a lot of work being done behind the scenes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8840.359s">[Kit Collins]</a>: on the city side and the inner side all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8842.439s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Very much appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8843.22s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is there a motion to adjourn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8848.06s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8850.361s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8853.521s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to keep the paper in committee and adjourn by Councilor Leming, seconded by President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8860.163s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8861.063s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8861.283s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8861.983s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All those opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8863.583s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=8866.404s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion passes and the meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oQhgxoJb8UA&t=814.672s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oQhgxoJb8UA&t=815.513s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I always appreciate hearing the rundown of the services that you provide in the community for our excellent partners at the Council on Aging and the MIJ.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oQhgxoJb8UA&t=824.22s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I noticed that this funding would mostly go towards supporting your existing services through the first quarter of FY25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oQhgxoJb8UA&t=829.604s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was just wondering... The first quarter, you said?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oQhgxoJb8UA&t=832.707s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is it just that the CDBG funding would enable continued service through the first quarter of FY25, or would it be year-round?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oQhgxoJb8UA&t=918.286s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you, that's helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oQhgxoJb8UA&t=919.386s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know that a lot of minds in this room, including Councilor Tsenghap and working on those ongoing conversations about kind of filling out the transit network.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oQhgxoJb8UA&t=926.708s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Right, right, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oQhgxoJb8UA&t=956.318s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oQhgxoJb8UA&t=956.639s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oQhgxoJb8UA&t=956.959s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know we're eager to support that extension.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oQhgxoJb8UA&t=960.04s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oQhgxoJb8UA&t=1897.095s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oQhgxoJb8UA&t=1897.936s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Not a question, just a comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oQhgxoJb8UA&t=1899.156s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know for myself and many other councilors and city staff members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oQhgxoJb8UA&t=1903.211s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, we hear month in and month out how meaningful it is to have these service providers operating in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oQhgxoJb8UA&t=1909.917s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it's kind of interesting to talk about this topic and many others in sort of a numerical way, but you know that blowing past that 155 community members goal into 200, you know, 200 people served and supported and coached and housed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oQhgxoJb8UA&t=1924.598s">[Kit Collins]</a>: is so meaningful when you think about that on the basis of individual people, individual households.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oQhgxoJb8UA&t=1928.042s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So no question, just thank you for the good work that you do on behalf of our community and working to fill and expand our supportive safety net here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oQhgxoJb8UA&t=2306.857s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There certainly is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oQhgxoJb8UA&t=2308.178s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just thank you so much for coming for us, providing this update, this information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oQhgxoJb8UA&t=2311.581s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's great to hear that the change made to the overall allocation after this meeting will be in the positive direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oQhgxoJb8UA&t=2317.365s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But always appreciate these overviews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oQhgxoJb8UA&t=2318.886s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's a great chance to just revisit all of the good work that is being done in the community by CDBG grantees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oQhgxoJb8UA&t=2325.15s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I would motion to report the paper out favorably.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=4587.179s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=4587.459s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=4588.72s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Most of my specific questions have been spoken to already, but just gosh, that last point really brings home the, you know, looking at efficiencies with what we're already working with before rolling out new systems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=4601.867s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So really appreciate your attention to making sure we're not leaving money on the table by just tweaking that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=4608.15s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm making sure people are following up on paying their fair share for the permits that we already put out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=4614.254s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just to congratulate you on the launch of the new public<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=4617.171s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It looks great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=4618.151s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I hope that that'll make that process easier for residents, developers, for your staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=4637.735s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=5359.635s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=5360.456s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Director Nwaje, for being with us tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=5363.758s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't have any specific questions about your budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=5366.46s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is, you know, predictably, admirably straightforward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=5370.423s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it really drives home the point, your department in particular, you know, how much this city is doing with the resources that we currently have available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=5379.93s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, whenever I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=5381.124s">[Kit Collins]</a>: hear about the work that your one-person department is doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=5384.526s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm pretty amazed at the breadth of your scope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=5387.949s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know it's everything from helping community members, liaisons, and representatives plan community events to making sure that City Hall is ADA accessible to trainings, working with multiple commissions, everything in between.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=5405.661s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Budget season is a great time to recap the work of our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=5410.287s">[Kit Collins]</a>: city departments and hearing the update from the DEI department to me just always brings home how much our city staff are carrying with limited resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=5419.789s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you for your work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=5420.929s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And certainly as we get through this tough fiscal spot that we've been in these past few years for the next couple of years, I'm certainly looking forward to seeing how this department might further expand and blossom as the city gains in resources and latitude overall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=5437.832s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you so much for your work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=6478.174s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=6478.494s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just a general comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=6480.055s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, as one Councilor who's been through this just a couple times before, it's really helpful to be able to start this process this early<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=6489.361s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to be able to have these conversations, you know, kind of with more time on our side with department heads, rather than trying to squeeze everybody into a few weeks in late May and June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=6500.403s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just a lot of thanks to all the department heads for coming prepared, starting in April and early May.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=6505.625s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Many thanks to the administration for accommodating and working with us on this earlier timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=6509.765s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's been really valuable to be having these discussions about what's in, what's not in, what's changed, what are you looking forward to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=6517.25s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, six months, one year, five years out at this point in the year is adding a lot to this process for me compared to prior years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=6524.276s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, so I just want to thank all of our city staff for participating in this new timeline and to the administration for supporting it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=6686.818s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=553.151s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=554.171s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I thank you very much and Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=558.473s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Former Councilor Caraviello was clearly a man for whom, you know, showing up for his community and doing right by other people was simply a way of life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=565.955s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It was simply his instinct, you know, regardless of, you know, politics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=572.397s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know people put a lot of that, you know, especially onto this council and these chambers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=576.018s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But from knowing Rick for a couple of years, you know, I think anybody who meets him knows him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=581.363s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, you see his heart on his sleeve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=582.925s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think it's just wonderful to see that recognized in the community, you know, the spirit of service by which he's truly lived his entire life in many roles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=591.693s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm glad to see him acknowledged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=593.455s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I will say I miss seeing him every Tuesday and Wednesday in the chamber.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=597.439s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1260.492s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1262.812s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On April 24th, we discussed with our zoning consultant the following topics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1268.114s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Some suggested forthcoming proposals to improve the site plan review process, updating the use and dimensional tables, as well as<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1279.974s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's one other thing, and I just forgot it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1282.076s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We had an update from our zoning consultant, and our next meeting with the zoning consultant in planning and permitting is next Wednesday, May 8th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1289.944s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then after that, we had a affordable housing presentation from Metro Housing Partnership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2793.919s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2795.12s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I actually want to start with an apology because I didn't notice until just this moment that the, oh, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2801.003s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I didn't notice until just this moment that the first two pages of the annual surveillance report that I submitted are actually missing from our agenda packet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2808.828s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They don't add anything particularly substantive, but what is included is just the surveillance report from the Medford Police Department and not the city council surveillance report that actually summarizes the data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2820.935s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's what our obligation is to submit at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2824.178s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It doesn't add anything substantive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2825.621s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It tallies up the number of approvals and denials of surveillance technology that we did in the preceding calendar year, which in this report is zero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2834.597s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That being said, I still don't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2836.144s">[Kit Collins]</a>: feel comfortable putting forward a motion for my fellow councilors to vote upon, having not seen the document in its entirety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2843.527s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I would motion to table this until our next regular meeting, and I will make sure that those first two pages that contextualize the data are included on the agenda at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2909.276s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2911.458s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this is a motion to support the aforementioned bills that are currently in the State House.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2918.085s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I received outreach about this from several people that work with the Massachusetts Action for Pilot group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2923.75s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This comprises workers and representatives of various social service and educational, et cetera, workers from across the state, all in support of this legislation, which kind of comes up year after year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2938.456s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The context for this is that currently in Massachusetts, large nonprofits that meet certain criteria are exempt from property tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2946.14s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have several of those here in Medford, most notably Tufts, my alma mater.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2951.062s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As an alumnus of Tufts, I've always felt my particular responsibility to advocate for changing that rule so that cities such as ours can implement<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2961.198s">[Kit Collins]</a>: more fair, essentially compensation systems with these institutions that take up such a large footprint in our communities, but don't have to pay property taxes like everybody else does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2973.39s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this bill would enable a local option that communities can choose to adopt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2978.203s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that would require that these large nonprofit organizations pay really only 25% of the tax obligation that they would otherwise have to submit if they weren't tax exempt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2990.908s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So it's really, in my opinion, it's not even going as far as it should, but so many of our conversations behind this rail are talking about the various infrastructural projects and personnel and services<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3003.186s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that we ought to be able to provide to our residents that we can't because of a lack of funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3007.989s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So any action that this council can take to level the playing field, I think is a worthwhile one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3013.493s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I ask my fellow Councilors for their consideration in lobbying the state house to allow us to give us one more leverage when we're looking for fair compensation from these large, well-endowed institutions that we host in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=3029.184s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4981.893s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4982.133s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears a motion to suspend the rules and take two four zero nine two at order on the motion to spend the rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5289.326s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5290.187s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just want to quickly thank, uh, manager manager DuPont Ryan Roberta for your work on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5295.61s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this is one of those projects in the community, um, where the CPC is really successfully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5301.893s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Leveraged funding over several rounds to get us to this phase of the park improvements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5308.557s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know this is something that community members, um, that abutters have really been looking forward to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5312.84s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, so I would motion for approval after further questions and comment from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5316.735s">[Kit Collins]</a>: my fellow councilors, but I'm really excited to see this progressing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=5319.256s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for your hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6234.258s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6236.311s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we should take the temperature down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6237.995s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just going to pause for a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6241.704s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let's take the temperature down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6245.655s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll start through the chair to Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6247.976s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate you're bringing up the process for the newsletter coming out of the resident services and public engagement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6255.078s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Obviously this is our, that committee of which I am not a part is just piloting this process going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6261.159s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I agree it would also be more comfortable if that was brought to the floor and disposed of from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6266.701s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's a great note for going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6271.846s">[Kit Collins]</a>: this is a resolution about discussing the city council subcommittee process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6276.189s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I just want to note that I don't really think it's in the service of giving people proper notice to weigh in on an issue that they care about, or transparency for us to be re-litigating a topic that is in committee, the committee that I chair, under a paper for which it was not brought up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6294.422s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I don't think that- I'm sorry, I didn't understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6301.715s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm going to finish my point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6302.676s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think that we should let this turn into relitigating the transfer fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6306.3s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are going to talk about that in committee so that residents and Councilors can be properly noticed about when the substance of that discussion is going to occur and come prepared, having thought about it and speaking about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6319.584s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Through the chair to Councilor Scarpelli, I hope you know that I sincerely respect you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6323.608s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've always enjoyed working with you, and I respect you enough to want to correct the record when things are being said that I think are a bad faith attack on my character.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6331.296s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that anybody who's willing to engage in this in good faith knows that there is a difference between me<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6336.341s">[Kit Collins]</a>: as an individual, using my name and my title to speak as an individual, using my petition, signing a letter in support of something, being crystal clear, it's me as an individual endorsing something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6348.685s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do that all of the time, on many platforms, on letters, on social media, and individual phone calls with various administrations saying I'm speaking as myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6359.248s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Every councillor here<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6361.556s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Every Councilor here has the opportunity to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6364.918s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Some exercise it more than others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6367.32s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Everybody in any role has an opportunity to say that, to say, this is the experience that I'm speaking from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6371.062s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm not speaking for my constituency, necessarily, when I'm signing a letter saying, I endorse this as a public official.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6377.787s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is concurrent with our public process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6379.528s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are going to have publicly noticed committee meetings about the real estate transfer fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6384.872s">[Kit Collins]</a>: At the same time, just like everybody here, I retain the right to say, I as an individual endorse that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6392.336s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also want to bring up, well, there's a lot to say about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6400.218s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's really regrettable that there has been so much consternation about, you know, this is a polarizing issue, and I get that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6410.201s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And maybe that's not even worth regretting, because polarizing issues are always going to be polarizing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6414.442s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it's how we move on from that that's really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6420.453s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I really take umbrage with the assertion that having some people in office who are supportive of one thing and other people also in office and also out of office who don't agree and going through that process of friction and tension and talking about it and arguing about it in public session<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6440.874s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I disagree that that's harmful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6442.635s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I take umbrage with the fact that being in support of something that doesn't have consensus is harming this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6449.878s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are going to talk about this in public session, as we have been doing, until it gets to the time we're going to put it to a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6455.881s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And when we put it to a vote, I want to remind everybody, what we put to a vote is simply asking the state for the authority to again meet in public session to deliberate on what we should do as a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6470.342s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't believe that perception is reality, actually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6473.124s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that when people are telling us how something should make us feel, we should follow the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6480.929s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I hope that, I know we're gonna continue to talk about these issues in committee, these polarizing issues, these issues that leave many of us feeling extremely passionate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6494.974s">[Kit Collins]</a>: but I think we should all come with our own opinions and a mutual respect and an unwillingness to believe that anybody in the room is out to get the other person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6503.778s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And whoever's telling you that somebody in the room is out to get the other person, they're probably wrong, because we all live here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6509.961s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7154.691s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Wait, can I interject really quickly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7156.932s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No, Councilor Scarpelli, I didn't mean that you were being deceitful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7159.493s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, well, I can read the full text.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7737.74s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We should go to public participation or call to question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7825.702s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears and Gaston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7827.163s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sorry to interrupt you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7828.384s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do think I was just gonna<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7829.785s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's more relevant to a resolution that is coming up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7832.328s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also have a clarification to offer that I think speaks directly to your question about the difference between what's talked about in the letter and the process of the home rule, but we can get to that under the next paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7841.938s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7842.678s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I'm happy to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7843.599s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for indulging me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8374.906s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8375.246s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8375.806s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I made a motion to call the question, but I just want to interject with one more thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8380.046s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Like I mentioned, I exercise my right and privilege to add my name to sign on letters at my discretion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8388.728s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Another topic that we talked about earlier in the agenda, the payment in lieu of tax legislation that's being considered by the State House.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8396.05s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Last week, I also added my name to a list of signatories separate from the paper that we discussed and dispensed with tonight, I also signed that letter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8406.181s">[Kit Collins]</a>: acting as myself as an individual, signing on as Kit Collins, Vice President of the Medford City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8411.143s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And like all the other times that I've done that, the letter was not phrased in such a way as to purport that I was speaking for this council, because I wasn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8419.466s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I made no assertion of speaking for this council, because I wasn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8423.188s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was endorsing it as an individual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8425.229s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Tonight, when we passed that resolution, we chose, through our votes, to endorse it as a council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8436.61s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I don't disparage anybody for feeling angry or disappointed in me for choosing to advocate for issues that you would rather I not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8447.813s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That is your right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8449.654s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that there are many people in the community who disagree with me on that issue and many others, and many who do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8455.016s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that is your right, and it is absolutely your right and your privilege to say so in these public meetings, however you want to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8463.171s">[Kit Collins]</a>: However, I really do think that we need to correct the record and draw a distinction between an individual official endorsing a policy using their own individual name and saying that this is in some way a breach of our process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8476.994s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They are two separate things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8478.714s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You are well within your rights to say, I disagree with you and I wish you wouldn't advocate for that, but that's not the same thing as us breaking a regulation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8487.856s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I really will stop speaking on the topic now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10163.302s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10164.703s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for speaking to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10166.004s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And again, this is similar to what I said before, but I again want to reinforce, I know that you disagree with, I'm sorry, through the chair, I know that many constituents disagree with me about my opinion on the transfer fee, the Home Rule petition, the Affordable Homes Act, which are again, two separate, totally separate processes about the same topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10184.977s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's your right, completely respect that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10186.898s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that there's a lot that we disagree on and a lot that we agree on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10190.12s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But the thing that I really think is important to reinforce<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10193.038s">[Kit Collins]</a>: is that we are talking about two different things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10197.502s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are all endowed with the right to endorse a piece of state-level legislation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10202.546s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we've probably all done that at different times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10205.228s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And there's a separate process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10206.489s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Or oppose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10207.13s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Or oppose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10208.591s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And there is a separate process by which we come together as a city council in committee meetings to collectively, in public session, craft what we are actually putting forward to the state house to say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10219.824s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the majority of city councilors voted for this, that we would like for you to put forward as state legislation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10226.93s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I hope that, I'm trying to find the words to make this more clear, because I understand that it's confusing for a lot of people, that the Affordable Homes Act, which is a massive housing bond bill that also includes a proposal for a local option for real estate transfer fee, encounters the same topic as our proposed real estate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10247.096s">[Kit Collins]</a>: transfer fee home rule petition that is currently in the permitting and planning committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10250.778s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I understand that those are easy to conflate because there's that Venn diagram overlap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10256.822s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I just want to reinforce for people who are not as deeply intimate with this issue as all of us behind the rail are and the people who most frequently show up to the public meetings, I just want to make it crystal clear that these are two separate processes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10273.171s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They're related by topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10274.687s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They're two separate processes, and I just think that's really important to make clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10278.388s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And if I may, while I have the floor, as we're talking about the processes with possible home rule petitions, I think the most important part of this conversation already happened, which is how do these actually happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10290.593s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What's the process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10292.274s">[Kit Collins]</a>: City Council goes to the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10293.834s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They could full stop at the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10295.935s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If they don't, they go to the delegation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10298.736s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They get put forward as a legislation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10301.701s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't like to talk about this often because I think that we should do them anyway, but yeah, I have no optimism that the Home Rule petition that we may or may not craft here in Medford City Council will become law because traditionally they don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10316.432s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've been a member of home, I've been a participant in home rule petition efforts in my first term on the Medford City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10322.234s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Did any of them become law or get even close?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10324.795s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No, absolutely not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10326.396s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But, you know, to use the words of somebody who spoke just earlier, I don't think that this is a slight issue at all, the housing crisis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10331.538s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that it's a major issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10333.099s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's why I think that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10334.644s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's why I think it's so important that we have the conversation with every mechanism possible, including lobbying for state-level legislation, as well as having the conversation about if we should lobby for this, essentially, with a home rule petition, because the issue of displacement and housing unaffordability is so large and so rampant in Medford that I really think it's worth having that conversation anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10358.572s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11255.885s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears and Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11257.606s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate you refocusing us on the actual text of our discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11262.53s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I just want to make one further comment, and then I will<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11269.025s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the question again, I guess, though I feel more confused about the meaning of that motion than I did a half hour ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11274.368s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think that we've had a robust discussion on this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11277.67s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But in terms of the, I think, the most important part of our discussion about the processes of dealing with possible home rule petitions is just the technical process, like the universe of what can happen with home rule petitions, which we already talked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11291.358s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But just as speaking about these home rule petitions in particular,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11296.525s">[Kit Collins]</a>: as the chair of the planning and permitting committee, which they are both assigned to, in terms of what residents can expect from these home rule petitions in particular, and because the issue of, and because the concept of what else are we doing about affordable housing just got brought up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11312.295s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I agree, I certainly would never assume that people who don't happen to endorse the idea of a real estate transfer fee are not proponents of increasing affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11322.728s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Most of politics is just disagreeing over the tactics and not the outcomes or goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11327.712s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And to that end, my expectation as chair of the committee in which a lot of these affordable housing conversations are going on is that we have, this is also the committee in which we are discussing our slate of major comprehensive amendments to our zoning code.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11347.688s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that gets brought up a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11348.689s">[Kit Collins]</a>: People talk about making it easier for developers to build in Medford<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11352.534s">[Kit Collins]</a>: both to increase our commercial tax base, to make it easier to add new high quality residential units.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11359.779s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are going to lay the conditions for that to happen through updating our zoning code.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11365.923s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Speaking as the chair of the committee, that is my priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11368.304s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is something that this council has been working on, I know, for at least two terms, which means one term longer than I've been a part of the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11376.155s">[Kit Collins]</a>: pivotal work that we are going to be doing on this committee, that's my priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11379.397s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't expect to take up these formal petitions until the fall because we have a budget to pass in May and in June, and we have a lot of work to get through with our zoning consultant, which this council fought for, for, I'm gonna say, at least three calendar years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11396.63s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we're so serious about the issue of housing affordability that when we say every tool in the toolbox, we really mean it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11402.619s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're going to talk about zoning that will make it easier to develop commercially and residentially in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11407.3s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're going to talk about ADUs, which I know are really important, you know, kind of on the minds of many Medford residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11414.581s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we're also going to talk about home rule petitions, but the work that is squarely within our jurisdiction, zoning, as chair, I'm always going to prioritize that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11424.283s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so in terms of the process, in terms of the timeline that people can expect, I just want to, I want, I feel like, I thought this was a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11432.15s">[Kit Collins]</a>: a topical time to bring that up, both in terms of the timing that people can expect these to go over and also to just kind of recontextualize these formal petitions with everything else that this council is prioritizing to do with the outcome of increasing affordable housing in Medford and also increasing the commercial development that will expand our resources to support our residents and all manner of other infrastructural and constituent services project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11472.476s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just on the motion to receive and place on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11512.19s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would make a motion to join and approve the food truck permits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11515.911s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's papers 24-086 through 24-091.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11517.251s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I heard that, George.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11518.131s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Now I'm mad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11518.951s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's all over now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=11641.392s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to take from the table 22494, the budget ordinance for third reading, and to take from the table 24080, the supervisor of water and sewer personnel ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12046.769s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12047.53s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for bringing this forward to this forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12053.032s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Along with President Bears, I've also been made aware of the situation by protesters on Tufts campus and people working with them, supportive of their cause.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12062.676s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just community members who have noticed this going on over the past few days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12066.257s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've tried to remain in contact with those organizers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12069.259s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Also been in contact with our mayor, chief of police, and the government affairs liaison on Tufts campus about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12076.842s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've been very clear with all of those leaders and decision makers that my opinion is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12084.244s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is, it would be a insupportable use of city resources to deploy Medford police to break up what has been a peaceful and unproblematic student demonstration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12097.909s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is not germane to the use of our city resources, but as a Tufts alumnus, I'm very proud to see the students there joining into this cascade of peaceful demonstrations across the nation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12112.392s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And speaking as a community representative, I am deeply concerned about the safety of students and other community members on campus should the Tufts administration decide that a forcible removal of protesters is the objective that they are going to accomplish by use of force and by use of Tufts University Police.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12137.216s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I hope that it doesn't come to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12139.957s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I pray that it doesn't come to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12142.257s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that that would end badly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12144.039s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that we've seen on other campuses that this is an extenuating event that should be allowed to remain a peaceful demonstration, a gathering place, a place for students and community members to process what's going on, to gather together and to show their solidarity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12160.931s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that it would be, I would hate to see something so benign<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12168.999s">[Kit Collins]</a>: speaking here as an individual community member, and again, speaking as a Jewish person, I would hate to see something so benign be escalated because of the use of police force in breaking up a peaceful protest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12180.782s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so I'll reiterate my message to our administration and Tufts administration that I unequivocally would condemn the use of police force, whether Tufts or Medfords, especially Medfords, to forcibly decamp the protesters<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12196.851s">[Kit Collins]</a>: from where they have been camping out, gathering, making food, celebrating Passover on the Tufts University academic quad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12205.366s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12327.629s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, just one thing to add.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12329.741s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know a couple people have reached out to me saying, what can the city council do about this to make sure that the people demonstrating on Tufts campus are kept safe?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12338.648s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As we often say, the city council instructs and commands no city staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12343.912s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's very little that we can, there's nothing that we can do to interfere formally, or sorry, I shouldn't say interfere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12349.056s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's nothing that we can do directly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12352.099s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to affect what happens on Tufts campus, but I would say to constituents that are observing this meeting, if you are of the opinion one way or the other on how Medford police resources should be deployed, if you feel that they should not be used to disperse a peaceful encampment on the grounds of a private university, if you feel that's inappropriate, now would be a good time to let the administration know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=12378.033s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=0.56s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There'll be a meeting of the planning and permitting committee April 24th 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=3.502s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This meeting will take place at six p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=5.564s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In the city council chamber, second floor Medford City Hall, 85 George P has to drive and on zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=11.168s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mr. Clerk, would you please call the role?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=26.345s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=27.665s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=29.446s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Five present, zero absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=31.127s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This meeting is called to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=33.447s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you all very much for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=34.648s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have several city staff in the room and on Zoom, in addition to the committee members and our zoning consultants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=45.951s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The action and discussion items for tonight's meeting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=48.872s">[Kit Collins]</a>: is 24033 which is the paper number for the zoning ordinance updates that we are working through with the Innes Associates team beginning a couple months ago and that will continue through most likely September of next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=63.443s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We also have an affordable housing training run by Mass Housing Partnership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=67.827s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This will occur later in the meeting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=70.226s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We will reconvene after the public works committee, so stay tuned for that we will take the zoning ordinance updates first and before I pass it over to city staff and our zoning consultant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=83.533s">[Kit Collins]</a>: just to quickly run through the top lines of what we'll be discussing tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=88.796s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, at our last planning and permitting committee meeting where we were discussing the zoning ordinance updates, we looked at the memo that is kind of an evolving document seeking to capture everything that we are trying to do in this zoning amendment process, pulling together recommendations from city councilors and from city staff and pulling in discrete policy recommendations from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=111.807s">[Kit Collins]</a>: comprehensive plan, housing production plan, climate action and adaptation plan from the ZBA and the CDB and trying to put that into a document and schedule out over the course of the next 18 months how to group these various policies and projects into kind of topically batched projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=129.825s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we took a look at that we're still adding to that menu to that memo and that will continue to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=134.898s">[Kit Collins]</a>: evolve and change in the statuses for the various policies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=137.558s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll get updated as we go along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=139.879s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What we have on deck for tonight is reviewing definitions and definitional changes recommended by city staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=147.82s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And as associates, we're going to look at site plan review, as well as mapping framework.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=153.381s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And at the end of the meeting, I think we can also just do a quick overview of kind of what we're currently planning for, you know, the next step after this one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=161.983s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This process has been one of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=163.55s">[Kit Collins]</a>: trying to plan a couple steps out even as we're working through current steps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=170.456s">[Kit Collins]</a>: With that, I'm happy to pass it right over to Emily Innes unless city councilors or city staff have anything they'd like to say first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=182.667s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing none and no hands raised on Zoom, Emily, please go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=863.391s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Emily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=864.392s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Really appreciate that overview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=866.314s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know I have a few questions based off the presentation, but we'll go first to city councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=871.238s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I see Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=872.359s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=1240.237s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Emily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=1240.917s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=1241.998s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Director Hunt, anything more from yourselves at this point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=1413.8s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Commissioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=1414.541s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Pierce?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=1613.776s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=1930.227s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=1930.487s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=1931.648s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Emily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=1933.209s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Really appreciate this discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=1936.451s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just a couple clarifying questions from me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=1939.552s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just want to confirm we're talking about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=1944.741s">[Kit Collins]</a>: this committee reviewing proposed changes to the definitions at our next convening in this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=1953.066s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That includes the table of uses proposals as well, is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=1959.931s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=1961.051s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just to, my preferred way of taking in information is just to paraphrase and make sure that I'm getting it right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=1968.776s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So my understanding is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=1970.544s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, for example, with the table of use and parking regulations, nothing is actually changing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=1975.388s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No regulations requirements are changing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=1977.069s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're just updating the nomenclature to make it consistent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=1979.971s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=2003.819s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=2004.339s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for confirming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=2006.22s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that that will be a welcome change, as we've mentioned before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=2012.93s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, part of our work, you know, in the later half or three quarters of this process, we'll be looking at more substantive, we'll be considering more substantive changes to the neighborhood maps, incorporating stuff from our various plans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=2024.4s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And in other cases, we're just trying to make these documents more legible and more useful so that the uses and the development that we already allow and that we want to encourage will just be easier to do from both the business side and from the city side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=2037.011s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that certainly falls under this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=2039.312s">[Kit Collins]</a>: category.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=2040.532s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just jumping ahead really quickly back to the site plan review proposed changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=2046.114s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If you wouldn't mind returning quickly to the recommendations for potentially considering minor plan review, administrative review, municipal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=2056.216s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm curious, what's the difference between minor and administrative?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=2060.938s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are you considering both?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=2062.398s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That sounds to me like it might be an either or, but I'm curious the distinction there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=2139.646s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=2139.987s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for clarifying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=2141.167s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=2142.628s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And again, towards the end of streamlining the processes and making the language really intuitive, I think what we're talking about here is creating<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=2152.043s">[Kit Collins]</a>: a review process for minor plans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=2154.826s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that recommendation makes sense to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=2158.83s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any further questions from councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=2160.492s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=2603.422s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=2603.782s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We were speculating last night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=2604.824s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It makes me think of Jaws every time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=2611.812s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Commissioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=2614.716s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Recognizing Attorney Silverstein.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=2717.245s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=2717.965s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that point is well taken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=2721.666s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And important to keep in mind as we do progress towards the squares, corridors, and neighborhoods part of this process in phase two and phase three, how we can essentially, I think that a lot of our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=2731.471s">[Kit Collins]</a>: shared goal here is to how to create the zoning that aligns with the uses that city, the resident wants, and that makes it easier for us to take developers up on the development that we really want them to be doing in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=2748.023s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=2749.404s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing no other further comments on this time, I'm just going to shift towards kind of summarize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=2754.508s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, Director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=2955.402s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=2955.723s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Attorney servicing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=2956.803s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=2957.604s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that, um, we should certainly add that to our list of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=2964.915s">[Kit Collins]</a>: items to check and double back to either at the May 8th meeting or at the appropriate time to make sure that if this is being addressed through language changes to municipal review, then it's consistent elsewhere throughout our zoning ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=2980.49s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for taking a first approach at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=2987.682s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we have about five minutes until we should take a recess of this committee so that the Public Works Committee can use this space until around 7.30, and then we will reconvene in this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=2998.225s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I just want to try and quickly summarize us towards the end of this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=3008.769s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=3009.849s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do see that I'll get to him in just a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=3014.311s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for flagging that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=3016.201s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just want to make sure that we're all clear on what we're preparing for for our next meeting, anticipating the proposed definition change language, as well as table of use proposals, recommended language on site plan review, and then the proposal for mapping and the GIS zoning map.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=3034.906s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Emily, are we expecting that for next time or just an update to the status memo bringing us closer to those proposals?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=3046.138s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=3046.979s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=3048.341s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we'll go quickly to Gaston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=3051.405s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=3052.987s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I've asked you to unmute on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=3125.138s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for that comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=3126.199s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We appreciate you bringing it up early in the process so that we can make sure that that is something that we do discuss with our zoning consultant, and we'll certainly have a conversation about that and see where it might be deliberated and discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=3139.689s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know this is in the interest of Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=3152.018s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=3154.179s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are there any further comments, questions from this time from members of the public, councilors, city staff, and associates before we take a approximately 30-minute recess?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=3173.967s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=3175.307s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just to restate, we will reconvene after the public works committee, um, has net, um, same zoom, same channel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=3183.369s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're taking a brief recess to allow for that committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=3188.01s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, thank you so much, Emily and associates, uh, city staff for being with us tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=3192.411s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And again, for members of the public, um, we will reconvene after the public works committee to have an affordable housing training from the mass housing partnership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=3199.753s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Do I have a motion to recess?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=3200.953s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Do I have a second on the motion to recess?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=3203.594s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=3205.775s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On the motion to recess by Councilor Callahan, seconded by President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=3208.816s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mr. Clerk, when you're ready.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=3238.364s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=3239.426s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Five in favor, zero opposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=3242.11s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The meeting is recessed and will reconvene.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=3250.387s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, the Planning and Permitting Committee is hereby reconvened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=3254.288s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for bearing with us during our quick, short recess to take a meeting of the Public Works Committee, and now we're back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=3263.99s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are going to be hearing from the Mass Housing Partnership and housing planner, Aditi, on 24083 and affordable housing training.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=3275.132s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I will hand it over to Aditi to introduce our guests, and please feel free to take it away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=4691.561s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Quick question on this slide, if you don't mind an interruption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=4694.282s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The recipients for these funding streams under the QAP, can that be communities, local housing authorities,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=4701.693s">[Kit Collins]</a>: other quality of?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=4719.452s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=5077.796s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, I have a really small clarifying question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=5080.177s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For the RADS slash section 18, you mentioned that there isn't new federally funded public housing being built.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=5085.7s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So is that when a unit is just moved to a new location?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=5120.342s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So there's no net increase in the number of units.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=5123.485s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's a change in the voucher method?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=6106.581s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you both so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=6107.921s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I personally found this very helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=6110.362s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm already thinking this is something we should do every term, because this is such a table-setting overview of the local context of why trainings like this work, like this is so relevant to our work here in Medford, in that regional context.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=6125.127s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think it provides a lot of color for a lot of the work that we're doing here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=6131.989s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And not just the city council, of course, but our local housing authority are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=6136.626s">[Kit Collins]</a>: fledgling Affordable Housing Trust city staff, a lot of the decision points and situations that come across the various groups in our city that are contending with these questions at various phases in the process of going from the acknowledgement of our local status of affordable housing and everything that is proposed to do about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=6160.941s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=6162.522s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I see Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=6408.285s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Do you want to take on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=6991.649s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=6994.31s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any further questions from members of the Council, members of the public?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=6998.811s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=7226.699s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any further questions from members of the council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=7230.22s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Members of the public?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=7234.361s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing none, I want to thank you again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=7236.521s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this meeting, like all of our meetings, will be recorded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=7239.342s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's on Medford Community Media.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=7241.195s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't know if this was already planned or if it's possible, but I think these slides could be really useful for us to have to put on our city council website as an ongoing resource, if it's possible to convey those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=7249.336s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'd really love to have them be published and shareable and preferable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=7253.497s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As this does come up over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=7261.439s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=7262.819s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We really appreciate your time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=7263.939s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We appreciate your expertise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=7265.779s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm sure that this information will continue to guide us as we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=7269.929s">[Kit Collins]</a>: we're going to work through a term full of housing priorities of zoning and determine which are very quite new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=7278.334s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Affordable Housing Trust is really just getting its legs under it for the first time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=7282.176s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this information will continue to stay relevant top of mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=7294.524s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=7298.891s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any further comments from councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=7302.293s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, before we do that, I also want to thank the planning department for setting up this presentation tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=7307.135s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=7307.795s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this is very valuable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=7308.916s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Housing Planner Aditi, and thank you, Director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=7314.358s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=7315.579s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seconded by President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=7317.66s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we can do a voice vote at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=7340.719s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=7341.039s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On the motion of President Bears, seconded by Councilor Lundin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=7343.26s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=7347.603s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=7371.229s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On the motion of Councilor Leming, seconded by President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=7374.492s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=7375.873s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=7376.454s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And this is the vote to receive and place in file and adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=7390.526s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is that okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=7392.968s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So it's Leming's motion to receive and place in file and adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=7419.338s">[Kit Collins]</a>: 8.15.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=7423.705s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Do we need to recheck that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=7426.249s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=7427.871s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=7428.492s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=11.0s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Present<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3909.113s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, I think Councilor Callahan had her hand up first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3912.974s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just a general comment, I really appreciate the communication so far as our budget season gets off to its start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3918.996s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that it's been,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3920.808s">[Kit Collins]</a>: busy start to this kind of forecasting, assessing, and planning season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3924.249s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate the communication so far, and I think this presentation is really helpful as we head into and get further into the weeds together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3930.651s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I haven't heard a lot of specific questions from me tonight because I think sort of the scope that we're looking at that President Bears just summed up are kind of the concerns and questions that are on all of our minds, which is, you know, as we, as the work gets on, it continues on your side to try to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3948.462s">[Kit Collins]</a>: bring the two numbers in reconciliation with each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3952.364s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, obviously the question that we are all, you know, continuing to discuss is reconciling what we have with our fixed non-negotiable costs, especially in our first budgeting year after ARPA, which, you know, this will be my first budget after ARPA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3969.914s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It feels like a seismic change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3971.675s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know that, you know, essentially we have our rock solid non-negotiables<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3978.066s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think for this council, we have other non-negotiables that are technically negotiable, but from the value that they bring to the community, you know, often come into this conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3987.411s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're having a budget conversation here that we know is fiscally really difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=3993.194s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that we're all, you know, all eagerly and with a little bit of anxiety anticipating, you know, when we get to that reconciliation phase, how many of those programs that are, you know, programming staff, you know, working together to make sure that we are,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4008.922s">[Kit Collins]</a>: keeping as much in this budget during this very difficult year as we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4011.742s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm glad that we're doing that together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4013.723s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm glad that we're starting early and I appreciate all of the early communication around what kind of scenario we find ourselves in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4020.984s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it is great to hear about all of the coordination efforts, which I know are not new, but get a little bit more finessed every year with trying to lump together those costs that occur in different places around the building, around the institution to make sure that we are not duplicating expenses where we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4035.647s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Because in this type of budget year, I know that every little bit<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4039.053s">[Kit Collins]</a>: does make a difference, especially when we are talking about some of those grant-funded positions that we're trying to keep within the operating budget, which might be, you know, under $100,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4047.599s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Like, some of those cost-saving measures could really make the difference for positions like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4052.181s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So all of that is really meaningful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4053.242s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4054.142s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know we'll probably have some tough decision points and discussions ahead of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4060.546s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But, you know, the early information is very appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4063.088s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Appreciate all the effort that you're putting into this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4065.069s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5099.332s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5099.892s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just a quick clarifying question on the same topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5102.013s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You said nine months on the RFPs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5103.593s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is that, do you expect to get proposals back from vendors or just what's the step in the timeline?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5153.912s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Understood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5154.237s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5872.007s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, it doesn't have to be a motion, but will the slides from today's presentation be emailed around for the councillors who want it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5877.611s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5877.931s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5985.199s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5985.439s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just want to again thank Director Dickinson, Chief of Staff for being here tonight and for preparing us for this meeting, all the documents you've prepared for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5993.267s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5994.268s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And thank you as well to the clerk for the budget presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=5999.013s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think we need to thank ourselves for ours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=6001.876s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=6003.858s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=319.824s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, something like that, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=323.356s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would also suggest a, I tried to suggest language for the rent stabilization home repetition that we might be able to create a template that works for both.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=331.638s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1183.684s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Chair Leming, while you're hearing from non-voting members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1188.413s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanted to, before I leave you to your deliberations, I think that this is a really great start, a really great framework.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1196.818s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm excited about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1197.738s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think what I hear from people all the time, like in my first term as well as recently, is it's so hard to know what the city council is doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1204.442s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And this is of course not a perfect solution, but I think anything that we add<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1209.565s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And the beauty of essentially an e-list is that people can always be added to it, and that content can be used in other channels as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1215.309s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think that this is a worthwhile endeavor that is only additive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1219.632s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It doesn't really take away from anything except for our time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1224.356s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that in general, it could be helpful for us to just have standard language for how we talk about certain things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1229.139s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In my email that I sent over to you earlier today, just kind of a standard sentence structure for at our XYZ meeting, we passed a resolution commemorating<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1244.892s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just want to run through these really quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1246.313s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A lot of my comments did just kind of trying to get into the trying to get into the mindset of the average resident who doesn't know what we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1253.314s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So one of the comments that I sent to you, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1256.315s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Around the passage of the leaf blower ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1260.456s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I suggested<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1265.273s">[Kit Collins]</a>: as opposed to we approved completely the new leaf blower ordinance, sending it to the mayor for the final approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1271.535s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This ordinance will phase out gas-powered leaf blowers in favor of electric ones over a four-year period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1276.936s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I just want to emphasize, I think it's helpful to not assume that people know what it means to pass an ordinance completely or incompletely, just to sort of use kind of specific language for what we mean by that, to kind of imply that there's two votes, rather than to use general language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1294.6s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And a lot of our ordinances are, of course, are very complicated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1300.693s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They're hard to boil down into one or two sentences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1303.138s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1306.704s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it'd be great for us to include hyperlinks wherever we can so that, you know, to sort of help people with their inevitable questions of what do you mean, what do you mean specifically, where can I read more about this, so that people can click to immediately get their specific questions answered to read more about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1320.611s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But wherever possible, I would love to use language like giving the final vote of approval so that it's more clear what we mean by that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1328.955s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Similarly, in the planning and permitting committee section,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1333.397s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've been trying to use language of this committee began the process of updating and amending our zoning ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1340.302s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just think that's a little bit more specific than I know I've been using the word overhaul a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1344.525s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that it's like a little more precise when we say we're amending the ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1348.247s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're updating the ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1350.829s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I hope that that will<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1352.469s">[Kit Collins]</a>: better signal for more people what that process actually looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1355.791s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then I do think it might be helpful for people to include that second line that I suggested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1360.573s">[Kit Collins]</a>: NS Associates has worked with the city of Medford previously, including on our comprehensive plan, just to give that context that this is a known contractor that we've collaborated with before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1371.139s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, and last thing, sorry, um, if this hasn't already been mentioned, um, under the administration finance committee section, I thought it would be helpful to add some context to the draft budget ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1384.744s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I suggested, and this I emailed to you earlier, this committee is finalizing the draft budget ordinance, which for the first time creates a timeline and meeting schedules for updates and communications between the city council and mayor's office during the annual budget development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1398.408s">[Kit Collins]</a>: process, and I just wanted to include some sort of implication there that we're at the final stage of this, something that was begun in the previous term, and more specifically what that means.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1423.976s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What I was just referencing was the email that I sent to you before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1426.538s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1426.658s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I did, so I did, I did include everything in that in the meantime, but you also sent, um, I was just noticing some language discrepancies from what I sent you and what I saw on the doc.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1436.224s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I just wanted to make sure that you have the specific language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=1361.564s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=1362.265s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=1363.286s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=1364.106s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I always appreciate your presentations come budget time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=1366.889s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My fellow Councilors have covered a lot of my questions at this point, which are pretty basic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=1371.854s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know your department's budget is pretty straightforward, and this is pretty early in budget season, so it's great to be having the conversation now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=1379.722s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But just want to take a moment to recognize you for the hard work that you and your department do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=1383.625s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All year, we know that senior centers institutionally wear so many hats.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=1388.928s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You're providing basic services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=1390.209s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You're also providing fun and community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=1392.79s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's a lot of balls to keep in the air and on a pretty tight budget as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=1396.233s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just thank you so much for your resourcefulness and for all that you provide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=1400.235s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I hope that this council can remain supportive as senior centers programming and offerings continue to grow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=1407.28s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=2972.31s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thanks so much for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=2975.633s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't know, the whole soft speakers, loud speakers, I don't think it's an issue, I never hear about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=2989.91s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But you know we're reaping the benefits of some of the improvements that's been made over the past year with these additional monitors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=2995.576s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's really helpful for Councilors I hope that there's been some benefits for folks in the audience as well and it's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=3002.042s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great to hear some of the things that are in the percolator for continuing to expand access for making the meetings more accessible, even within the chambers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=3009.545s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know, not because of anything that has to do with your department, because of this room and its acoustics, we frequently hear from folks, you know, gosh, it's really hard to hear kind of no matter what.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=3019.448s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So it's awesome to hear that those headsets are on the eventual to-do list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=3024.91s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that could help out a lot of folks who have a hard time reading the subtitles and hearing in the chambers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=3029.619s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thanks for letting us know that that is in the hopper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=3032.721s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that it's a tough year across the board for those blue sky items, but I think it is helpful for us to get a benchmark on what needs are coming down the pike.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=3042.308s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that even like 30K for the video switcher is pretty small in terms of capital investments go, but I hope that we can kind of stay in conversation about what those needs are so we can make sure that they get allocated and budgeted for in a way that we can make movement on them when the time is right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=3059.759s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think you touched on this quickly before, but just a question about one of the funding streams.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=3063.682s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that the cable company fee, a portion of that is earmarked towards community media.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=3070.168s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't know a lot about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=3071.089s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I learned about this relatively recently from a community media station in another city, actually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=3076.053s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Does that earmark from the cable companies that they pay to the city, does all of that funding go to MCM or does part of that go to the general fund as well?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=3084.06s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just curious the streams that funnel into.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=4574.979s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for being here and welcome again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=4576.881s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know it's been several months, but we're so happy to have you on board, and I think it's such an advantage for our community to have somebody who brings so many perspectives to this role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=4586.291s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thanks for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=4587.432s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Welcome to your first budget season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=4588.814s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=4593.103s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think part of the reason that it's really great to have a presentation from department heads during budget season is it's not just an opportunity to share with the community, what you're up to 365 days a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=4604.349s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think it's really important context for us and all the work that we do, like what is the other work that we're trying to do in the community that has those<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=4611.874s">[Kit Collins]</a>: direct and indirect shared goals with what your office is working so hard to accomplish.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=4618.32s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you for that, for being here to provide that context and that perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=4622.404s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It sounds like it's been a really busy first several months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=4625.287s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So busy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=4625.988s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On the job, which is very impressive to hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=4628.01s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's fantastic to hear about the ADA upgrades for the office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=4631.073s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That seems like a really important, really overdue thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=4634.196s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you for getting right on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=4635.957s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't have any specific questions for you at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=4639.059s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The departmental budget is pretty straightforward, but just thank you so much for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=4642.161s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I hope that we can be partners in the work of your office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=4645.663s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Please do feel free to be in touch with us any time of the year with how we can support you and what your office is working on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=5283.513s">[Kit Collins]</a>: To be clear, my only objection is being the one to pick it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuNkVVK6Cjg&t=5288.616s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't want that to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=245.136s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We at this meeting we reviewed a draft work plan of the city council's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=250.918s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that was prepared by the city's zoning consultant, Innes Associates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=255.219s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The draft work plan will continue to be updated to reflect the input of city staff and Councilors, the ZBA, the CBB, and it will evolve to track progress on different zoning policy goals as this project continues over the next year and a half.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=270.443s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=359.153s">[Kit Collins]</a>: 24082 resolution to acknowledge April 30, 2024 as National Animal Therapy Day in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=364.897s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Whereas there are thousands of pet partners therapy animal teams serving communities across the United States.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=370.542s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And whereas pet partners has designated April 30 as National Therapy Animal Day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=375.886s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And whereas scientific research shows that interacting with therapy animals can reduce stress, relieve depression, slow the heart rate, lower blood pressure and strengthen the immune system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=385.27s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And whereas therapy animal teams in the city of Medford play an essential role in improving human health and well-being through the human animal bond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=393.071s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And whereas therapy animal teams interact with a variety of people in our community, including veterans, seniors, patients, students, and those approaching end of life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=402.673s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And whereas these exceptional therapy animals who partner with their human companions bring comfort and healing to those in need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=409.934s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And whereas we encourage more pet owners to consider becoming pet partners, volunteers,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=414.551s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to help our community by creating greater access to meaningful therapy animal visits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=418.872s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we acknowledge April 30th, 2024 as National Animal Therapy Day and encourage our citizens to celebrate our therapy animals and their human handlers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=430.675s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Be it further resolved that we publicly salute the service of therapy animal teams in our community and in communities across the nation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=437.742s">[Kit Collins]</a>: be it further resolved that we request that Mayor Lungo-Koehn issue a formal proclamation of National Animal Therapy Day in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=445.065s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=503.462s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any further comment from councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=507.705s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any public comment on this topic?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=510.708s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Hearing none, Madam Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=518.334s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Paul, could you come up to the microphone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=520.396s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just give your name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=524.2s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Watch it, Lily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=528.904s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just your name and address for the record, please, Paul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=583.063s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Paul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=584.223s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's a pleasure to see Lily getting so comfortable in our chambers today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=589.184s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=591.285s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Madam Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=613.022s">[Kit Collins]</a>: 7 in favor, none opposed, the motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2077.998s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears and Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2080.119s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's a good idea for us to have this discussion, you know, to use the word from your resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2085.782s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We know we're coming up on budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2101.029s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2101.609s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I frequently need a reminder to talk louder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2103.21s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2110.988s">[Kit Collins]</a>: but I know I'm not loud enough to talk over people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2113.249s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli, I appreciate the resolution to discuss the water and sewer department, especially as we're coming right up on budget season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2121.072s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a conversation that we're going to have anyway, and as other councilors have noted, this is a conversation that we've had every year in the past two budget cycles that I have been a part of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2130.896s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, this is a, this has been raised as a multi-million dollar issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2138.057s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We know that it will take multi-millions of dollars to make good on this investment, to bring ourselves out of the rear of all cities and towns in Massachusetts when it comes to our water infrastructure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2150.86s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I believe that Commissioner McGibbon told us during our budget hearing last year that we're one of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2158.728s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The three cities with the oldest water infrastructure in the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2161.659s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's that's not a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2164.744s">[Kit Collins]</a>: end of the ladder that any of us want to be on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2168.085s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we know that this is multi-millions of dollars in the fixing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2172.067s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is many decades in the making.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2174.828s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One thing that I do find heartening from the letters from the administration, from letters from current and former members of DPW leadership that I think is heartening, is that there's a clear mutual respect from Commissioner McGivern and former Superintendent Stoneking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2190.255s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That mutual respect within the DPW leadership<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2194.458s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, and knowing that this is a shared priority between the DPW, between the City Council, between the administration, we know that we need to look for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2205.37s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We need to look for assets wherever we can find them with this big of an infrastructural project ahead of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2212.639s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As was stated earlier, we were the first council to vote to keep retained earnings within the Water and Sewer Department so that it could go towards funding infrastructure repairs and improvements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2221.87s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Obviously that is a small first step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2226.806s">[Kit Collins]</a>: we have a ways to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2228.487s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I am glad for any steps in the right direction that were taken by ARPA, that were taken by Superintendent Stone King during his tenure, and that I know that Commissioner McGivern is working hard on every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2239.393s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think it is one of the things that rang most loudly for me from Commissioner McGivern's letter to the city council was that all of these major infrastructural efforts<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2252.301s">[Kit Collins]</a>: between bringing our water infrastructure up to par and our roads infrastructure up to par.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2258.483s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, we got at least 500 million on the water side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2263.004s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I believe it's maybe even at least 200 million if we really wanna get every road where we know residents want them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2269.766s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These things have to be done in concert, be done efficiently to make sure that we're making the best use of every dollar because we have to use so many of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2278.888s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Last point I wanna make for now, I did,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2281.363s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Commissioner given noted the most recent report from the M. W. R. A. On the state of Medford sweater, which is from 2021 in his letter to the City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2290.848s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I did follow that read through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2292.949s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that it's worth noting that when it comes to when it comes to our water infrastructure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2298.925s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We know, because everybody has cited, that some of our pipes are 120 years old.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2303.929s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We also know that the most recent report from the MWRA is that our drinking water is safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2308.472s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we also know that we have a lot of work ahead of us to make sure that it stays that way without interruption for all future generations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2314.057s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2982.114s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I apologize for interrupting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2983.855s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would like to motion to take public participation out of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2986.377s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I understand we have a member of the audience who can't stay very late, but would like to speak during public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3032.243s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3033.004s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was informed that there's a former member of the council who would like to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3036.609s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3751.636s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So moved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4750.992s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli, we've known each other for a term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4752.673s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, there's a lot I agree with you about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4753.994s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's some I disagree with you about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4755.155s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's not news to anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4757.076s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What I do think that we all share is that we're looking for the holistic picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4761.468s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and I do think that as a city council under our current charter, we're kind of always at a disadvantage because we do have the final vote on the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4771.012s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We don't craft it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4771.972s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We can't add to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4773.353s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We can only make line item subtractions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4776.934s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are in a difficult and disadvantaged position to have that 30,000 foot view on the budget when we receive all of our information<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4786.638s">[Kit Collins]</a>: through intermediaries, through departments, through the administration, essentially second hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4791.223s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think all of us have found that challenging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4793.265s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that I have found it challenging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4798.646s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's a lot that I think is really critical as we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4800.968s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We already had a conversation tonight on two major pieces of infrastructure that we know will take years to bring up to the level of condition that residents deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4810.076s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we barely even touched on the new high school, and that's another one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4813.959s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Residents deserve a new, better high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4818.103s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think it is both true that we need to make sure we have a clear picture of why our budget is the way it is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4826.078s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in fairness to everybody, and we have to hold that it's equally crucial that we do what needs to happen so that residents have the environment and the resources and the public sector and the public staff and the city infrastructure that they deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4844.248s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know for me, we cannot afford to wait on any avenues that can get us closer to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4851.872s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also do want to note, you know, we speak about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4855.552s">[Kit Collins]</a>: what our jurisdiction is and what our jurisdiction isn't for, you know, what city resources look like and what our budget looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4863.841s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also want to add, since we mentioned Mystic Avenue, it's a constant source of frustration for me that we don't have a more direct hand in the spending of city resources so that we, you know, when<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4873.422s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4873.522s">[Kit Collins]</a>: City staff and residents come to us bringing up particular projects and departments that we can't more directly intervene.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4880.126s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I am really proud that this council has, you know, for several terms now made it a shared goal to do what we can on the zoning ordinances side so that we can lay the foundation for rapidly improving new growth commercial<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4896.855s">[Kit Collins]</a>: it's not direct because developments come from developers, but we have a direct hand in laying the foundation where our commercial tax base, where new growth can flourish in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4908.644s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so I'm proud that that's one piece that we do have jurisdiction over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4911.786s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This council is making a priority for several terms now, and we are already starting to see developers take advantage and start to take<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4923.094s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that's going to benefit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4925.875s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um everything that we talk about in these chambers that deserve more investment than what we're currently getting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4929.936s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=7473.923s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=7476.924s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you again for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=7478.405s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know from my other line of work, just a glimmer of how much work writing these grant applications is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=7483.866s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know this was a whole, truly a whole crew effort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=7486.787s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=7488.007s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is really interesting to get a glimpse into.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=7491.729s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This other side of the work of administrating the fire department and just to echo what Councilors and Councilors are probably put out there you know this council is no stranger to putting together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=7501.44s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that we can do to bolster the application.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=7504.882s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think, of course, I'm sure that in a perfect world, we'd all like to see, you know, overshooting, getting up to that, you know, maximum recommended number and using those three years to figure out how to stay there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=7515.326s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But in lieu of that, you know, it's my hope that hopefully we get great news at the end of July and in that intervening three years is when we're, you know, getting to a place of better resilience with the city's budget so that we can further escalate in a reliable way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=7529.552s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9721.353s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9724.718s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, we had a robust discussion about the water and sewer department earlier in the evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9729.921s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think the compensation and classification study was brought up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9734.744s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Personally, as one Councilor, I'm very much looking forward to the season whenever that arrives, when we can take a holistic look and see the analysis that we know is being worked on with the Collins Center in consultation with the city staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9749.893s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to get that overall picture of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9751.755s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We know that some of these roles have salaries that are no longer competitive with our neighboring communities, maybe have not been for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9764.084s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The point of this, the ultimate point of making sure that our positions are kind of accurately and up-to-date compensation-wise salaried, is to make sure that we are as competitive as any other municipality at attracting the best talent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9779.821s">[Kit Collins]</a>: because of the downstream effects that that has on our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9783.462s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All that to say, it's not my preference to do these CAF changes one at a time, but we also know that this position is incredibly critical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9792.106s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a point of inflection for our water infrastructure, and I don't want us to lose any time at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9797.488s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Even if it's just a couple of weeks, that could make the difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9799.969s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If making this position more competitive will bring somebody on faster, I think we should do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9804.591s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm gonna motion to approve for first reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9946.944s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm happy to defer to other suggestions at this time, but what's on my mind is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9955.34s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I said earlier, I feel a sense of urgency around this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9957.521s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would prefer not to wait two weeks to take the first vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9960.543s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I feel like an advantage here is that we can ask for information and if it's relevant, we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=9968.766s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have the third reading to take an additional vote on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=10041.3s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'd be happy to, I actually don't know if there's a way to attach a B paper to an ordinance, but I would like the information on this union issue attached to the, sorry,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=10054.591s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't actually know if there's a way to attach a B paper to this particular vote, like we do with resolutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=10058.853s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would like the answer to Councilor Scarpellioli's question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=10060.933s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would prefer to vote on this tonight, but I'd be happy to put your question as a B paper to the vote, if that is an option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=10231.863s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to take paper 21057 off the table for third reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=10235.945s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's the leaf floor ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=10694.252s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=10695.433s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'd like to put forward a motion to receive and place on file the following papers that are under reports due slash deadlines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=10703.796s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I can read them off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=10705.917s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's 17-606.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=10711.118s">[Kit Collins]</a>: 20-086, 22-007, 22-009, and 22-039.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=10711.518s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That motion is to receive and place all of those on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=13.579s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2465.592s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Paris, and yes just to underline that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2471.379s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That was the one of the motions from our last committee meeting on this topic was for Councilors to send any preliminary suggestions that they wanted to see included in this kind of bird's eye view demo of what we're going to do over the next year and a half.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2485.076s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But this is certainly going to be an evolving document and I think that we can, President Bears and I, together with NS Associates Director Hunt and her staff, can work together to keep information flowing, you know, from individual Councilors through myself and Director Hunt to the zoning consultant to make sure that as new ideas are raised, that's getting added and, you know, looking out at this project,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2514.574s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a we have an ambitious slate of topics and themes to work through between now and next summer and fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2521.958s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so I really appreciate having this benchmark for kind of the, the version number zero of this memo and looking forward to seeing how it's going to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2532.044s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Updated in coming months I think it'd be really helpful for this committee, you know, with its five different viewpoints for the council with it seven different viewpoints for the residents for city staff to be able to say hey I raised this as a priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2543.574s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A month ago six months ago where we at with this I think this will be really helpful for tracking progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2549.46s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just to just to color in that picture a little bit, you know, to, to adhere to my.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2557.356s">[Kit Collins]</a>: our last committee meeting, I did send ahead some of my own priorities and suggestions to Director Hunt and Innes Associates for ideas that I'd like to see included at the juncture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2568.305s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's exciting to see Innes Associates is already beginning to incorporate some of the really specific policies and goals from the comp plan, the housing production plan, the climate action and adaptation plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2581.637s">[Kit Collins]</a>: into this memo, I know that that'll probably be fleshed out more we fleshing out that more with ideas from the governing agenda to make sure that everything that ought to be in here is in here and is on the to do list for myself and I already conveyed this to our zoning consultant, the email but just to mention it in the setting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2601.505s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Three of the role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2603.88s">[Kit Collins]</a>: projects that I want to make sure that we're aligning with as we get through this is making sure that the areas of the draft tree ordinance that touch zoning, want to make sure that we're working on those at the appropriate time, ditto the draft condo conversion ordinance, and as with a lot of our other things that are more on the level of like themes and goals as opposed to discrete projects and policies, making sure that we are, you know, prioritizing our complete streets and Vision Zero<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2632.501s">[Kit Collins]</a>: goals as we're working through the map and the districting processes and a lot of these layout, you know, kind of at the district court or a neighborhood level, I think, whether it's transit related use related.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2648.314s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, where those goals, resiliency, housing, commercial development hit the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2653.917s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll be looking at those in abstract and also at kind of at the neighborhood level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2659.159s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So all that to say, I think this is a structure that will greatly advantage us as we try to touch on all of this in the coming months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2669.444s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Paula, for being here today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=3573.594s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=3574.955s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a comment, not a motion, but I just wanted to reflect that I think this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=3580.45s">[Kit Collins]</a>: stage of the process kind of encapsulates a lot of what we're trying to do here which is both taking the visions and goals of the plans that we've the city is, you know, collaboratively created over the past three to five years, and putting those into a zoning code where they can actually be implemented and residents can start to see changes like the type they've been requesting for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=3602.108s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, in some cases, decades, depending on the topic at hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=3605.469s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And at the same time, it's also a process that is meant to streamline how, you know, the work of the city gets done and how development gets done and make this a city where the type of development that we do want to be happening can happen more efficiently, more easily with less burden on city staff and also the people that are trying to build and work and contribute to our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=3627.534s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So it's great to see<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=3630.023s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, both facets of many represented in this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=3635.347s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And thank everybody for their participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=3637.169s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is going to be a long project, but it's exciting to be formulating how exactly, you know, we're going to try to roll out as much of this as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=3644.374s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=3707.472s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So moved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=390.116s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=391.297s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you to Councilor Tseng for co-sponsoring this with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=394.158s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just wanted to take a quick moment during this special time of the year for many people in Medford to acknowledge our Muslim community and wish all celebrants a happy Ramadan during this special time for their faiths.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=406.685s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=629.501s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=630.281s">[Kit Collins]</a>: At this meeting of the Planning and Permitting Committee, we discussed two resolutions, one from the previous term about amending the short-term rental ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=640.92s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to include a monthly report from the short-term rental platforms such as Vrbo or Airbnb so that we can better reconcile the post-reported and platform-reported number of short-term rentals in the community and make sure that we're in compliance with the short-term rental ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=658.168s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We also discussed a resolution from this term to review the fee schedule for like across city departments and boards to make sure that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=668.186s">[Kit Collins]</a>: we go through the process of asking city departments for feedback on which of those fees are updated or out of step with our neighboring communities so that we can make sure those fees are covering the relevant administrative costs and brought into the modern age.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=681.077s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1214.712s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll defer to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1217.413s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll second your motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1344.881s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1346.121s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As I said last week in committee, I appreciate Councilor Leming for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1350.162s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that even if all we were doing was updating the technical aspects of this ordinance that are out of step with how it's actually utilized, that would be a productive thing to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1360.565s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think it's in keeping with where we're at as a community and this modern moment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1365.667s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to be adding, as we discussed at length last week, the point of the linkage fees is to associate certain costs from developers for the things that they affect in our community when they come in and build here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1378.716s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Things like parks, things like roads, sewer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1380.657s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's appropriate to be adding an affordable housing bucket at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1385.26s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I look forward to reviewing the recommendations that the city board comes back to us with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1390.824s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'd motion to refer to the community development board<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1466.58s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1467.821s">[Kit Collins]</a>: 24059 offered by Councilor Callahan resolution to create a rental registry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1472.204s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Whereas the city of Medford has climate sustainability, affordable housing and other goals that would be easier to accomplish if we could reach either renters or landlords or both in our city, and whereas a lack of a registry of rental properties means that we currently miss opportunities to reach either our renters or our landlords or both.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1489.257s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Be it so<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1494.059s">[Kit Collins]</a>: with energy efficiency standards as described in the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan, Section 2.2.D.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1501.583s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Be it further resolved that this ordinance be referred to committee for further discussion in the Planning and Permitting Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1507.606s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Be it further resolved that members of the Planning and Permitting Committee submit questions to the chair, clerk, and city staff ahead of the committee meeting scheduled for the subject.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1516.499s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and be it further resolved that the council work with the building department and the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability on the drafting of this ordinance to ensure that it best serves the city of Medford and our climate and affordable housing goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1529.104s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1667.64s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1828.24s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're gonna go to President Bears, Councilor Leming, and then Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1961.93s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1963.012s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=1992.844s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Callahan, if you have a direct response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2036.274s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Tseng and then Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2083.183s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2083.303s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2083.503s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2083.763s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2083.963s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2114.086s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Excuse me, we're not going to interrupt people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2122.575s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Callahan, please go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2162.961s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There will be a chance for everybody to participate on this item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2171.122s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Please do not interrupt speakers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2172.643s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Callahan, are you finished?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=2175.594s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8452.79s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8459.512s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for letting me know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8462.873s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate the discussion from my fellow Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8465.254s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate everybody who's come to the podium to speak on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8467.754s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I am aware that hearing people tonight, people feel like they're not being heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8474.316s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm also aware that there's probably not a lot that I can say that people believe, such as when I say that everything that people have spoken to, I'm listening to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8484.199s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I won't speak for my fellow Councilors, but I know it's true for them as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8487.159s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8488.48s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm taking notes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8490.438s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We hear you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8491.698s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll echo what Councilor Callahan said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8493.419s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that engaging in every part of this process is important, taking note of things that really concern people with this proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8501.36s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For example, people are wondering, does this include compromising information?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8505.661s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think it does, but I think that's something for us to talk about in committee and make crystal clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8509.681s">[Kit Collins]</a>: People are saying, why is this necessary when I know that you have info about property owners already?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8516.823s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8517.523s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8518.843s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's a great question and we should look at okay, what really needs to be added to augment already already have, I think the most salient thing for me, all the folks in this room that are property owners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8530.41s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think Councilor Callahan made it really clear at the beginning, that's not who we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8534.633s">[Kit Collins]</a>: people said, we know that there are property owners in this community that are hurting neighbors as well as tenants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8540.915s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They're not the folks who are here talking about how much work they're putting into their properties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8544.556s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Those are the folks that we can't reach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8546.257s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And those are the folks that we need to be able to reach that we make sure that they are contributing to the community the way that all of you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8553.679s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this is, I know we're coming up on my time limit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8556.38s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's why I think this is worth considering further so that we can get into the concerns that were raised tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=8563.749s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and elucidate them and get that clarity and have those discussions with everybody who we already know is interested in this conversation and all the people that we didn't hear from tonight, because those perspectives need to be- Thank you, Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9392.393s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9397.077s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate my fellow Councilors for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9399.538s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also appreciate the motion on the floor to amend it from two minutes to three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9402.959s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's welcome change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9404.3s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Two minutes feels a bit too much of a cut right off the bat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9408.341s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think three minutes is more reasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9410.562s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that for myself is supportable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9413.163s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My reasons are the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9415.143s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that this is a tweak that will<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9418.113s">[Kit Collins]</a>: help more people to participate in our meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9420.835s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I can hear the response in my head and also slightly from the chambers of another way of looking at this, which is, you know, gosh, those jerks are really tired of long meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9431.844s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We know the job that we signed up for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9433.185s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, I'll speak for myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9434.567s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know the job that I signed up for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9436.188s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have a lot of long nights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9437.989s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know how to prep for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9439.33s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I drink coffee in the afternoon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9440.431s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I eat before the meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9441.732s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm paid to listen to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9442.953s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm gonna do that if we have to be here till 1 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9445.035s">[Kit Collins]</a>: every night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9446.076s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's the job, committed to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9447.776s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What I think is not okay is we're experiencing a tension between wanting to optimize for the number for people being able to speak at the length that they choose and wanting to make it possible for more people to speak at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9462.365s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think for a lot of meetings in a row, we've experienced people not being able to say their piece, people showing up and tending to speak and having to leave early because they have to get up for work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9471.23s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They have to go put their child to bed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9473.3s">[Kit Collins]</a>: any other reason, they can't stay up until midnight with us all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9476.762s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just saw it happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9477.582s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know there are some folks here to speak on a later resolution who said, I could speak if it comes up before 9.30, it's 9.40, they can't be heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9486.567s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that that is, I think that that leaves people out of the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9490.549s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that this is a way that we can make a small tweak to finesse this one avenue for participation that could have the result of allowing more people to participate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9502.679s">[Kit Collins]</a>: concurrently, I think that we can always do a better job of publicizing the various ways, other ways that residents can let their feelings be known with Councilors, which as Councilor Tseng noted, we still have the public participation section at the end of every agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9517.25s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Our information is public on the city website all the time, and I'm always really grateful to people who make use of that and always encourage more people to do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9525.597s">[Kit Collins]</a>: People can submit comments to the president, to the city clerk to have them entered into the minutes or to be read aloud into the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9533.375s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also do want to note that like all of our other rules that are governing this body, this is enforced at the discretion of the chair, whoever that may be, which gives us the option to make exceptions where the need arises or where the space arises.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9547.825s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For example, when we have a short agenda and aren't under time pressures, we can give everybody a little bit more breathing room in the event of, you know, I've heard from other communities, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9559.497s">[Kit Collins]</a>: using that discretion to allow more time for people with speech disabilities who do need more time to say their piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9565.139s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think this gives us a tool to allow more people to come to the podium, if that's the avenue that they want to share their feelings with the council, while still giving us the flexibility and doubling down on our other ways for having residents communicate with the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9579.805s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'll support the motion to move this forward tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=9583.927s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10612.808s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any further comment from councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=10616.37s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13002.218s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13002.738s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll try to keep this brief, but I think that we are touching on what seems to me to be an important topic kind of underwriting this council right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13011.901s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13012.895s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, as we have stated tonight and many other times, we're doing things a little bit differently this term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13019.416s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have more in different committees where meeting in committee is way more often.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13023.157s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We put out a governing agenda, which we'll continue to revise and update, which we've never done before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13028.278s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The council is going through growing pains.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13030.158s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think the committee is, the community is going through growing pains and seeing our evolution as a council and our workflow and trying to get used to that and trying to participate and understand, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13041.756s">[Kit Collins]</a>: what that looks like and how to plug into it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13043.698s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I just want to acknowledge that as a thing that I think is going on and that it makes sense to be going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13051.543s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that this is an important topic because I think that a lot of what people are wanting, we are trying to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13060.269s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know that there's some breakdowns in trust because I think that there's some<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13066.229s">[Kit Collins]</a>: messaging about what we're here to do, that is unfair and untrue, but has legs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13069.992s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think, I hope we're going to work through that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13072.094s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that that makes it hard to communicate when we say, you know, I hear folks say, you know, we feel like we should be a part of the process and we're not a part of the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13080.782s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that this council is trying to, for example,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13084.116s">[Kit Collins]</a>: make committees a place where people really do come together and get into the weeds with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13088.041s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Historically, they haven't been that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13089.583s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The fellow Councilors are right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13090.924s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Usually attendance is super low.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13092.486s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we all really want to change that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13094.528s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are we there right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13096.07s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No, absolutely not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13097.172s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Does it need to get better?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13098.493s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13099.474s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I really appreciate people calling that out and also making suggestions to say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13104.52s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, here's how we need to do this differently so that the energy and the input that we get at these meetings, what can we do differently and what just needs time so that that energy and that level of input is occurring in the place where it is on the schedule for us to get into the weeds together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13121.098s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we have some co-evolving to do to get to that place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13128.26s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I hope that we'll get there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13129.901s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And for myself as one Councilor for this group, I think that's an honest effort in good faith and to anybody from the community who is willing to bring that energy and that frustration and that irritation to help us get there, that's welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13144.366s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just as an illustrative example, because for me as one Councilor, it is frustrating to hear people say, we know this is a done deal or see what is sometimes a consensus and call it a conspiracy<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13158.212s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's fairly intuitive that people running, committing to do similar things, similar people voted for similar ideas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13167.017s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so now there's plurality of that opinion on the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13169.738s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think that's a conspiracy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13170.859s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's statistics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13173.6s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So it's frustrating to me to hear, this is a done deal, this is something shady, for an example of, I think what we're trying to, I wish that we got more,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13188.484s">[Kit Collins]</a>: attention all the times when we're stuck in the weeds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13190.885s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Council President Bears mentioned earlier at the very beginning of the meeting 10 years ago, the report on the food trucks ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13202.691s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's been one particular constituent that's been hounding me for months about the food trucks ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13206.233s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Where is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13206.693s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Where is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13207.194s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When's it going to get done?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13209.014s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're still working on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13210.155s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're still hearing from people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13211.256s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're still hearing from staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13213.857s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're going to give that the space that it needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13217.327s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sorry, I've gone on longer than I meant to, but I think that what we're talking about tonight, I think that we're circling around a topic that we are really earnestly trying to work through on the council, which is trying to get to a place where we can do this work together, we can bring in more people, we can put in the places where more people can be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=13232.539s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you for indulging me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15432.896s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have no right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15433.756s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No, no, I think we should just move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15674.295s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll go to Councilor Shang and then Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15821.127s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any further comment from councilors on the B paper?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15826.142s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Hearing none, I will relinquish the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=16518.868s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=16519.908s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate you reading out the full text of the resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=16522.189s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I am really proud to have put this on the agenda today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=16526.83s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The reason that this resolution is before us is because we have a really strong, robust, energetic climate and environment community here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=16538.594s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A couple of those groups have formed a coalition that came to me with the idea for this resolution, which is one of advocacy to say, we as a community,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=16548.26s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We see how climate change is already affecting our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=16551.481s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We see how it is going to affect our community in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=16554.822s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We look around, we see reality for what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=16556.762s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We know that we need resources greater than we can muster in a city's operating budget to adequately contend with how climate change is going to affect our community here on the banks of the Mystic River in a way that will protect residents of all backgrounds who live in all neighborhoods,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=16573.909s">[Kit Collins]</a>: of all the various geographies of Medford in a way that we can all continue to enjoy quality of life and safety here in Medford, both right now and a year in 50 years because of what we know about how our local environment is going to change because of the global weather trends that we are all experiencing and all projecting in different ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=16597.619s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a bill that was proposed this legislative session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=16601.36s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And again, to sort of reiterate what was stated in the text of the resolution, this is a bill that would enable the state of Massachusetts to create a fund that the largest corporate polluters would pay into, that money would then be earmarked for local climate change resiliency projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=16621.55s">[Kit Collins]</a>: for cities like ours, who are on the banks of rivers, who are already suffering from heat islands, extreme weather, so that we can do the work that we already know we need to do, that people already need and actually don't have the access that they need quite already in our community, so that we can do those projects adequately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=16638.64s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think that eight-hour heating and cooling centers in the coldest and hottest days of the month in Medford are cutting it already, let alone what we're going to be feeling<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=16648.766s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in five or 10 or 20 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=16650.986s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This state level legislation would try to create a stream of money to combat that at the local level in communities like ours from the corporations that are responsible for creating these conditions in communities like ours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=16664.049s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So to be super, super clear, this is a tax on no consumer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=16668.31s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a tax on no resident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=16670.01s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is going to your Exxon mobiles and saying,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=16674.537s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We can't undo history, but now you have to help us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=16677.498s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have to help us stay alive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=16678.818s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have to help us stay safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=16680.739s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have to help us preserve our communities with what we know is to come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=16685.2s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As was noted in the text of the resolution, this was given a study order in this legislative session, which means that most likely the legislature will not take action on this section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=16694.943s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They won't be able to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=16695.964s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They've decided to consider it for the rest of the year instead, which means slower action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=16703.667s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And this is, you know, in some cases, this is a way of taking the wind out of the sails of a legislative project or slowing the momentum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=16711.793s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think that this presents, you know, a really urgent opportunity for communities like ours to step in and say, you know, it's all the more important to be advocating because we know the clock is ticking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=16724.262s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It was ticking before, it's certainly ticking now that the legislature has declined to take action on it in this session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=16730.302s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm really proud to stand with many Medford residents who reached out to me to say, we can't afford to add any more years to this timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=16739.713s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We need to start funding climate resiliency now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=16741.535s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'd like to thank the coalition that brought this before me and thank my Councilors as I asked them for their support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20356.018s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for being here, especially for waiting such a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20359.58s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it's really helpful to hear it straight from MTA representatives, people who work in the schools like yourself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20365.382s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just thank you as always for being here, especially when it takes a really long time to take a turn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20369.724s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just wanna echo a lot of what my fellow Councilors have said, and also just, you know, acknowledge, like I know it's been, I know it's always hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20379.468s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know it's been an especially alarming couple of weeks with numbers coming out and then quickly saying,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20387.065s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, there was an error.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20388.847s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is the number now, because that affects your day-to-day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20392.21s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I just want to acknowledge that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20394.532s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My fellow Councilors have spoken to our role in this process, which I know for folks pretty intimately familiar with the budget process, is already familiar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20412.723s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is tough being so invested in the outcome in the school department budget specifically and having such an abstract role in the budget process at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20422.33s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it really is important to state for the record that while I think, speaking only for myself, we never have as direct of a hand as we want to have in the school department budget or really any city department's budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20433.419s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's important to state for the record what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20442.486s">[Kit Collins]</a>: we are trying to do within our city council jurisdiction year round and indeed over the past term into this term to try to lay the conditions where we can get away from this model where around every time this year, it's a scary time and it's an uncertain time and everybody is feeling concern or just feeling disappointment that we're not able to guarantee the things that we all know should be guaranteed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20468.466s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Really recently on the council side, we approved another PDD<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20472.414s">[Kit Collins]</a>: we're already doing on the zoning side to bring up that baseline in terms of our permitting, in terms of our commercial tax base.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20480.001s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One of the three major projects that we're gonna be working on the city council this term is that total zoning reevaluation overhaul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20489.389s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I feel like I bring this up all the time, but that undergirds everything that we can directly do to get to a city budget where we can reliably fund the things that students deserve, families deserve, teachers deserve,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20500.831s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is stuff that we have been working on as a council for advocating for that, fighting for that, for longer than I have been on the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20508.376s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Now we're at a stage where we are going to start actually making the literal amendments that will allow us to do what we can within our jurisdiction to increase that pie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20520.064s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's not to say that things are the way that they are and that's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20524.747s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They're not okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20526.068s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think I've made it really clear that I think it's not okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20529.39s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Nobody thinks that it's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20533.553s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I am also, I think that it is our responsibility to do everything we can with what's currently on the table to get the best outcomes this year and next year with the tools that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20545.458s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's why I voted for the budget last year after negotiating procedural improvements that would allow us to, this year, hit the ground running with the financial task force that we did announce last June so that we can have these conversations about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20560.279s">[Kit Collins]</a>: stability measures for how we're going to get away from this kind of crisis model of budgeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20565.681s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's why I'll never hold potential funding opportunities hostage to administration change, because I think that our students deserve more than that, and our teachers deserve more than that, and I think that all of the budgeting improvements that we need to see are already so overdue, and I think that every single person agrees with that, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20589.335s">[Kit Collins]</a>: we just have to do everything that we can at every single opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20595.0s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's how we have to approach this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20597.462s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I really appreciate everybody from the MTA bringing their perspective to the city council and to the school committee, which of course is always able to answer these questions probably in more granular detail, though I think President Pierce does a great job for a non-school committee member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20613.815s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that it's up to this council to, in these meetings, talk the talk,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20618.493s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and hold our administration to account, like we said, level service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20622.714s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's got to be the floor every year that we have to improve from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20626.095s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then we have to walk the walk in terms of doing what's within our power to increase the pie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=20631.817s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21424.995s">[Kit Collins]</a>: 24061 resolution to oppose landfill that endangers MWRA water supply.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21432.317s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we join with neighboring communities, environmental protection activists, and the residents of Hardwick MA in opposing the proposed construction of a landfill by Casella Corporation near the Quabbin Reservoir watershed due to the incredible danger it poses to our regional water supply.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21448.562s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Be it further resolved<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21449.994s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that a copy of this resolution be forwarded to the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority leadership and the Medford State Legislative Delegation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21456.996s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21547.607s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21548.948s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any further comment by members of Council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21553.41s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any members of the public who would like to speak?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21561.138s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Hearing none, on the motion by President Bears, seconded by Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21567.642s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=21568.343s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=5.726s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This meeting will take place at 6 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=8.828s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in the City Council Chamber, second floor, Medford City Hall, 85 George B. Hess Drive, Medford MA, and via Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=16.053s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mr. Clerk, would you please call the roll?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=28.6s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Vice President Collins?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=30.265s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=32.307s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Five present, none absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=35.11s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The meeting is commenced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=38.913s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The purpose of tonight's meeting is to discuss two papers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=44.173s">[Kit Collins]</a>: 23-427.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=44.653s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is proposed by President Bears in the previous council term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=50.958s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is a resolution to amend short-term rental ordinance to include a monthly report from short-term rental platforms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=59.303s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And by that, we're talking about platforms such as Airbnb.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=63.386s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The second action item for tonight is paper 24-008, also offered by President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=69.75s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That is a resolution to review the fee schedule<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=74.198s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I will read out the description of each resolution, then I will pass it over to President Bears to further describe these projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=85.146s">[Kit Collins]</a>: 23427, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the former Zoning Planning and Development Subcommittee need to discuss amendments to Section 8.4 of the Zoning Ordinance regarding short-term rentals to require a monthly report from all short-term rental platforms<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=102.591s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to ensure that short-term rental units in Medford meet all requirements of this section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=109.273s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then resolution 24-008, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the fee schedule of the city of Medford, appendix A to the city ordinances be reviewed and updated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=123.458s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I will now pass it off to President Bears as soon as he is ready to further orient us to these two topics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=353.387s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears, I appreciate that overview, and I, as one Councilor, certainly I've been at meetings where the nuisance issue that occasionally comes up with short-term rentals has been discussed, and others in which, you know, the effect of taking rentals off of the housing market to turn them into, you know, for example, Airbnb units, or HomeAway units, or Burbo units,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=382.193s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We feel that effect in the availability of rentals citywide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=385.575s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think that this makes sense as part of our overall efforts to keep tabs on activity of the short-term rental platforms in Medford and making sure that at least we have an accurate picture of what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=402.804s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=468.786s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any further comments or questions from Councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=471.067s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think in that case, we can proceed along to if you have any next steps in mind or care to share that sample language from the city of Boston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=485.931s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears, whenever you're ready, I think it makes sense to look at the language that other communities have used to mandate that platforms are reporting to the city on how many units they have in operation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=502.077s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Certainly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=502.857s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And if I'm happy to screen share if you want to send me a link or if you'd like to do so, whatever is easier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=507.3s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I will share with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=596.344s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=596.604s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bearson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=597.684s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just to sort of paraphrase that back to you, the fellow Councilors and residents, this is essentially mandating a report from the short-term booking platform.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=610.985s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that tells the city, you know, we have listings, we have rooms and buildings available within the city of Medford, this is where they are, this is if it's a room or a whole building or a whole unit, and this is the number of nights that each of the units was reported by the renter as being rented to somebody during the month to help us get a picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=634.775s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I see this as helping us reconcile<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=636.869s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're hearing from some of the people that rent rooms on the short-term booking platforms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=642.215s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes, this unit is a rental and I rented it for this number of nights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=645.419s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Reports such as this would capture from the platform side, this is the overall number of units that we know on the back end was rented in the city during this month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=653.669s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We could see if there's a discrepancy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=664.056s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any other comments from councilors at this time, having looked at this draft language?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=668.457s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This would be an amendment to the zoning ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=675.138s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Hearing none, President Perez, I want to kick it back to you for next steps, if you had any before I share my thoughts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=732.587s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=740.551s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=748.115s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Actually, let me...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=750.831s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are there any further comments or questions from councilors or members of the public before we take a vote on the motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=775.917s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=776.837s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Five in favor, none against.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=777.977s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=779.658s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this draft language will be referred to the building commissioner, IT director, and PDS director, and we'll get their expert feedback on it before we make any moves to fold this into our comprehensive zoning update so that this can also be updated while we're doing potentially other zoning changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=798.83s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is there any other discussion on this topic before we move on to our second paper for the night, either from councilors or from members of the public?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=813.081s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=815.623s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Hearing none, let's proceed along to paper 24008.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=822.088s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is the resolution that the city council review the fee schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=827.543s">[Kit Collins]</a>: of the city of Medford and look for areas to modernize and update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=834.526s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My understanding is that the intention of this resolution is to look across many departments, like any departments for whom it's relevant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=842.109s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Many departments charge fees for various things that they do in the city, such as issuing a marriage license or registering your car, getting residential parking permit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=854.954s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And in many departments, it's been a long time since those fees were updated and changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=860.997s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it's my understanding that in many departments, the fees that we charge are perhaps lower than they should be to correlate with the administrative cost of doing those functions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=871.921s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And they might also be very out of step with what similar municipalities are charging for the same functions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=878.624s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think the intent here is to make any astronomical changes, but just to do a standard review<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=884.062s">[Kit Collins]</a>: since one has not been done in, I think, many years, to see where are those glaring spots where things really need to be updated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=892.489s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think one of the questions before us at this early stage is to say where all of the fee schedules for all of the departments are on the table, what departments do we want to look at specifically, and who are we requesting feedback and context from at this time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=909.742s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But for further table setting, President Bears, do you have anything else you want to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=914.469s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and as the paper sponsor at this time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1229.339s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1230.32s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1230.98s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think the timeline sounds right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1233.723s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, I imagine, you know, trying to put myself in the position of a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1240.205s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Department head looking at this, I'm sure that there are some of those fees where what it is and what it should be will jump out as obvious, and others where it will take a little bit of calculation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1249.948s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What is the administrative cost incurred?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1251.649s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What would a more appropriate number be to do that research into what neighboring communities are charging to make sure that it's consistent with our regional neighbors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1261.212s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm going to go to Councilor Callahan, and then I see Planner Evans' hand raised on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1266.394s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Callahan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1328.164s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll go now to Planner Evans on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1524.548s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you very much, Daniel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1525.449s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's really helpful for President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1721.1s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Planner Everins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1722.801s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears, I appreciate this discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1724.342s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It seems like there's plenty of organization that would be helpful to both city staff and potentially developers and other people and entities that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1733.308s">[Kit Collins]</a>: trying to do the functions that incur fees to make it more clear what we're working with, where it lives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1741.593s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And on the city side, part of the overall effort is not only to update some fees that are at least a decade, if not several decades out of date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1754.861s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think in all of this, we're always trying to look at, is the procedure by which we update this the one that makes sense?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1760.144s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so I'm glad that we're also thinking<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1762.608s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, getting straight on for the different fees, for the different functions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1767.693s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is it by ordinance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1768.453s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is it by rule of regulation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1769.695s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Set by a board that doesn't have to go through an ordinance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1772.477s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'd be interested, as we're doing this review, just to see what options we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1778.042s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's always, for myself as one Councilor, for something like fees where we're trying to make sure that it stays up to date, it is sometimes helpful to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1788.356s">[Kit Collins]</a>: consider if we have other non-ordinance mechanisms for doing that, so there doesn't have to be a legislation every time to keep something, you know, proceeding with, you know, cost of inflation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1798.138s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1865.003s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1866.944s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As we're, I think that we're going to be collecting input and feedback on ideas for a lot of departments and boards on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1874.689s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it's my hope that as we're going through and updating the fees themselves, we could also be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1879.062s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, as it's been mentioned, working to get all of the fees in the same place right now, it's really, it's pretty disorganized with a lot of things existing in other appendices on different webpages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1892.47s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it'd be helpful to have all the fees in the same appendix.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1897.673s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Kellihan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=1935.29s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any other questions or comments from councilors at this time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=2030.179s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=2032.781s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I definitely agree with the intent of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=2035.403s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'd also like to know if it's possible for us to institute an annual percentage increase to a fee by ordinance, regardless of the percentage of that fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=2048.633s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Do I have a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=2049.614s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=2050.434s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=2059.642s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I believe that's two motions currently on the floor, one of which is to ask department heads to take 90 days to review the fees that pertain to their departments, do the necessary question and answer research review to look into what changes they might recommend, send that back to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=2081.278s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Planner Evans has also offered to send to city council leadership<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=2089.021s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the document of community development fees that are not listed in Appendix A, which I think will be helpful context.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=2098.429s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have a motion on the floor as well to ask legal counsel if it is possible to connect an annual... was that a CPI increase?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=2125.962s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=2126.302s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For a legal opinion on, it's possible to put a annual percentage increase to a fee set by ordinance or CPI.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=2137.505s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=2161.343s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Certainly Councilors are probably, we'll be sure to take those as separate motions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=2278.769s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So let's just take the first one for now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=2281.812s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's on the first motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=2284.045s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I present embarrass with an amendment offered by Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=2287.467s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are we good to vote on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=2291.31s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is there a second on that motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=2293.932s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seconded by Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=2579.482s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Second by Councilor Lemme.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=2583.069s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=2585.23s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=2585.57s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=2585.77s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uzQnYqVC9YY&t=2585.95s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1179.478s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Chair Sang.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1180.458s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate the, you know, I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1184.312s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm glad that we have the opportunity to continue this conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1186.996s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think for myself, my concerns also center around what this council has been talking about for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1196.457s">[Kit Collins]</a>: months since before, you know, the March and the November 2023 election, which is the under-resourcing and under-capacity of our elections department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1206.826s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's true of any department, and it's not specific or personal to anybody who's been involved in elections in Medford, that when there's not enough people on the case, things will fall through the cracks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1216.794s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I believe we did see that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1218.271s">[Kit Collins]</a>: with November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1218.911s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We saw that less with March, and that's a positive thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1222.873s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I'm still really concerned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1224.453s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Of course, we have our chief of staff filling the role of the executive in that office right now, and we've seen transparency and communication increase from that department during that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1234.237s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But obviously, everybody's extremely aware, I'm sure, most of all the chief of staff, that that's glaringly, obviously, not a permanent solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1246.27s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've made it really clear a lot of times, I think that that should be a director level position, especially this year, but every year we need the best possible candidate running elections in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1257.416s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've said it many times before, I think that this is a department that needs to have more than two and a half full-time employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1265.299s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When any department is stretched that thin and tasked with so much,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1271.044s">[Kit Collins]</a>: things fall through the cracks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1272.186s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think that it is a symptom of a properly resourced, you know, professional level, municipal level elections department to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1284.5s">[Kit Collins]</a>: be it a state capacity wise where we're wrangling signage on an election day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1289.603s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's absolutely not a criticism of any person or involved or any system leading up to the March election, but rather this is, if this is the level of capacity that the elections department is at, to me, that is a resources and staffing issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1306.012s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I was happy to see that that was responded to very quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1311.192s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The issue was rectified, but our Medford deserves an elections department that has<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1319.724s">[Kit Collins]</a>: tackled the issue of keeping signage organized and is proceeding along to, you know, are we keeping our softwares modernized so that, you know, for example, files don't download as quickly as they need to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1332.171s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We should be at a level of resources and staffing where we can be a proactive elections department, as opposed to one that occasionally has to put out fires when there are really much more consequential things to be doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1345.379s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I absolutely would echo my fellow Councilors in saying whatever proposals the Elections Department and the Elections Commission has for identifying and prescribing and improving on current systems and identifying and improving on past problems, I'm eager to stand in support of those ideas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1368.517s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But my highest priority is getting to a place where we can elevate the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1374.449s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to a director level position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1376.41s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's really what's needed and taking a hard look at how many part time and full time employees does is really required for an elections department in a city of 60,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1387.698s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=3901.209s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Chair Stang.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=3902.55s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for being here to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=3904.679s">[Kit Collins]</a>: speak to this and for, you know, all of the very obviously extra work you've been doing over the past several months to fill this gap in the elections department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=3913.805s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think the council really sees that, and speaking as one councillor, it's really appreciated, and I hope that this additional labor is over for you soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=3923.246s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No specific questions to the chief of staff at this point, but just, you know, to further echo my, I'm really happy to hear that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=3929.51s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's obviously totally sensible that, you know, priority number one is filling that role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=3935.133s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Everything else flows from that, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=3936.634s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it strikes me that, you know, I tend to look at most of the issues that we have to collaborate on in the city as, you know, a problem or perhaps a potential solution of,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=3947.688s">[Kit Collins]</a>: project management.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=3948.488s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This certainly seems like one you need to find that person through whom policy updates and further staffing evaluations and the work of the department will flow through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=3959.671s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so it's good to hear that that's being prioritized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=3962.832s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that's a priority that this council shares.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=3967.494s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then just to take it back to the big picture, I again want to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=3972.816s">[Kit Collins]</a>: sort of reaffirm, you know, in my perspective, what this conversation is and what it isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=3978.778s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, I'll speak only for myself, but I know that every city councilor, you know, sees the hard work that's put in by the Elections Commission, and that has never been in doubt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=3988.561s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think when we talk about having support and having resources and having bandwidth, it's about resiliency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=3997.363s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And, you know, I think if, you know, if all the population of Medford<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=4003.517s">[Kit Collins]</a>: stepped up in the way that our elections commissioners and that team does so reliably and so, you know, above and beyond, then, yeah, our staffing needs within the city would be a lot lower because that would be a city full of superheroes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=4017.721s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But as a city council and as an administration, you know, it's our responsibility to make sure that these systems are resilient so that, you know, if another more enticing commission steals away, you know, the chair of the elections commission,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=4032.199s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that there's still ample people to do the work that absolutely needs to get done and can't not get done legally and for the health of the democracy of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=4041.648s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that's really the motivation behind these conversations is to say, how can we help to make sure that the elections department is as resilient as it needs to be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=4053.305s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, so that the next election, another consequential one, you know, goes as well as March did or even better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=4061.049s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And to make sure that city staff and commissioners and all residents and voters can feel that peace of mind throughout the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=4068.052s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I really appreciate everybody's participation in this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=4071.594s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think it's really great to have these conversations out in the open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=5685.938s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was just gonna say kind of, you know, to wrap up, really appreciate your time tonight and all of the information, the context.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=5693.864s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that this has been a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=5696.072s">[Kit Collins]</a>: a real exercise in transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=5698.173s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I hope that, you know, I think given the topic, I think that's a positive thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=5703.955s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I would also say, you know, to echo your words, Chief Staff Sarian, and also what a mission, long day, Elections Commission Chairperson Lawrence said earlier, I don't think anybody on this council is saying, you know, we have to get to a point where we can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=5723.851s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, realistically assume that no problems will occur.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=5727.412s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We know that's not the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=5728.332s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're doing this in the context and under the backdrop of reality after all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=5731.753s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But, you know, I appreciate the ability, the opportunity to, you know, talk about what's being planned, what's being worked on so that things will, you know, be professionalized and modernized and be as we intend them to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=5744.655s">[Kit Collins]</a>: With that, I don't want to supersede any other councilors questions or motions, but after I think a long and productive discussion, I would motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=750.747s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=752.868s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's helpful to get these drafts and recommendations after they've already been run by legal counsels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=758.852s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We know the committee is spending its time on something that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=762.216s">[Kit Collins]</a>: we know could potentially go forward, and I think that's, you know, of course, it's a nice use of our time to know that this has been pre-vetted, to have legal opinion saying, yes, this is doable under the Special Act and under the ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=775.039s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It makes sense to bring it into alignment with the Enabling Act from several decades ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=782.553s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to know that the language adjustments proposed are ones that we legally can go forward with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=788.496s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it's also great to begin this process knowing that we do have the ability legally to add that fifth bucket.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=796.94s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Fifth, is that right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=798.12s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=799.981s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For an affordable housing linkage fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=804.103s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think it's worth underlining, especially since<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=810.117s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, for many residents who aren't deeply, you know, intimately embroiled in municipal finance, I think it's worth underlining what linkage fees are and why they're set up that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=821.542s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, these are fees that are levied upon developments to kind of correlate with the municipal public sector infrastructural<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=834.5s">[Kit Collins]</a>: things, the public infrastructure that new developments will have an impact on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=839.624s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Developments have an impact on police, fire, roads, water and sewer, and developments also have an impact on housing affordability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=848.291s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is another phenomenon that new developments brought into the city also have an impact on, as well as how many more cars will be driving on our roads and how many more potential units will public safety have to respond to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=863.495s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think it's really in keeping with the spirit of what linkage fees are a tool for to say, you know, new developments coming in impact the housing market and so there should be some sort of formula set up by the experts, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=879.799s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that correlate with that issue in City Hall to figure out what that formula should be so that we can make sure that housing affordability is compensated for when affecting developments come into the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=892.972s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All that to say, I think this is a very worthy project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=895.154s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm very happy to support this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=897.957s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't have any, well, I guess my specific question at this point<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=902.803s">[Kit Collins]</a>: through the chair to Councilor Leming would be, what would the next step on this be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=905.926s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that some of this rests on, a lot of these specific decision points rest on the Office of Planning, Development, Sustainability, working in concert with the mayor to do those, to do those updates, you know, at least every three years to make that formula.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=921.401s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What other details have to be worked out on the committee side other than setting up the enabling parts of the ordinance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=927.527s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=1417.408s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to again thank Councilor Leming for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=1420.538s">[Kit Collins]</a>: his work on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=1421.218s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm really glad to be getting the ball rolling on really modernizing our linkage fees and appreciate the collaboration with the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=1430.441s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much to our housing planner for weighing in on this tonight and for, you know, your office's review of the document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=1440.764s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would motion to keep the paper in committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=1443.965s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I look forward to hearing staff's comments on the proposed ordinance changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=1514.468s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have a clarifying question then, which was, I thought that city staff was also going to provide further comment on the draft of the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=1520.309s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If that's not the case, I would withdraw my motion in favor of reporting it out of committee, but I thought that we were going to further amend it before pushing it forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=106.305s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=107.306s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just to recap, the last time that we talked about this project was in November of last year in the previous term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=114.45s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I don't remember the dates that we met on it previously in 2023, but I know that we've had numerous Committee of the Wholes on this topic before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=125.596s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Overall, I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=127.509s">[Kit Collins]</a>: on the council, at least the last time this was discussed in the previous term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=131.71s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The consensus on the council was very clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=135.531s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The intent here is to streamline the process by which one day food truck vendors may obtain that license so that they don't have to come before the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=149.035s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think in the past, especially for city events, things of that type, it's just been a logistical scheduling problem for vendors to line up<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=157.321s">[Kit Collins]</a>: when to be the floor of the city council to get their permit in time before the event actually occurs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=164.088s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think unlike some other types of vendor licenses, it's, I think there's perhaps less of a clear need for a food vendor, a food truck vendor to stand and present and talk about their business and talk about the reason for wanting to have a food truck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=179.286s">[Kit Collins]</a>: at a one day event in the same way as it's important for people seeking, for example, first time common victualers license to come before the city council and present on the business that they're proposing to open up in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=191.775s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Given that, just to recap, kind of the goal of this ordinance is to take what is right now a fairly inconvenient and cumbersome process for a fairly limited scope, setting up shop as a food truck for one day, and make that simpler.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=207.574s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So our goals coming out of the previous committee of the whole were to take the draft ordinance and really just simplify it to make sure that it aligned with newer existing Board of Health regulations in such a way that prospective food truck vendors could just go to the Board of Health, make sure that they met certain guidelines, obtain that license, and then go forth to be a food truck vendor for one day, perhaps at a pop-up,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=236.989s">[Kit Collins]</a>: or for a one-day event, and have that be that, and not have to involve the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=244.57s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we did request feedback from a number of department heads, some of which have followed up to give, I think, fairly limited comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=256.352s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think that Director O'Connor has given a lot of feedback at this point, though we've been in touch with her about this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=265.254s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Our economic development department<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=267.695s">[Kit Collins]</a>: forwarded along comment to council leadership, kind of agreeing that streamlining and simplifying the process is good for businesses in general, and also kind of adding to the chorus that we've heard from the Chamber of Commerce and some other businesses in Medford saying, you know, the only real worry here is the potential for competition between mobile food truck vendors and existing brick and mortars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=292.082s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that brings us back to the point that the intent of the council with this ordinance<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=296.463s">[Kit Collins]</a>: is to create a better process for those one-day food trucks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=299.826s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think this is a project about getting more long-term food trucks into Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=305.15s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think what would be helpful for kicking us off would be, I know that Attorney Stein from KP Law is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=311.214s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Attorney Stein, if you would be willing to walk us through the three documents that you've proposed here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=319.36s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that we have draft amendments to the City Council ordinances, we have draft Board of Health regulations,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=325.464s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then we also have one more, excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=332.483s">[Kit Collins]</a>: City Council regulations of mobile food vendors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=335.204s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think for myself, the City Council doesn't typically promulgate regulations, so I'm really interested in getting an overview of how these pertain to the goals coming out of our last meeting, and especially where the City Council regulations of mobile food vendors could potentially fit in, or if that's something that we should try to align inside of the Board of Health policies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=357.012s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=687.895s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Pierce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=688.835s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Attorney Stein, for that overview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=690.596s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's very helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=692.016s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think if I'm hearing you correctly, just to reiterate, it seems like the main two points coming out of your analysis are satisfying the stipulations that are sort of within the Board of Health's purview to weigh in on, like adherence to the sanitary code, making sure that everything you want to be happening in terms of sanitation and food safety within any vendor providing food is happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=715.921s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, things really on the board of health side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=717.402s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then on the other side, this piece that more intersects with the city council authority is use of public ways by vendors, in this case, food truck vendors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=727.829s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think this is where, you know, I wanna give my fellow Councilors a chance to weigh in on this, but I think this is where I'm really curious if there's a way for us to designate this, this is a question of,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=745.56s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, in one scenario, the city council exercises this authority to sign off on use of the public way by vendors by assessing every food truck vendor application that is submitted and saying, yes or no, this is an appropriate or safe use of the public way, or no, we don't think that in this case, the public way should be used by this particular food truck vendor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=768.447s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think for me, my priority for this meeting is talking about if there's more,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=775.01s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=775.43s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think the intent here is to get issuing one day permits, something that doesn't have to occur on our regular agendas anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=782.535s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And secondly, because I would hate for this to turn into an issue of the City Council is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=805.168s">[Kit Collins]</a>: consistent rubric for why some and not others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=808.291s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know for the outdoor dining ordinance, we put a lot of work in and we had many conversations with city staff to say, okay, so who needs to check what box when it comes to traffic safety and visibility and having the bollards this far away from the travel lane to make sure that these licenses can be issued in a way that we're sure<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=829.188s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, we're doing our due diligence to make sure that motorists and pedestrians are safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=833.93s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then we handed that over to, you know, the relevant city department to, like, sign that form on the application.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=840.472s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm wondering if there's something like that that we can do here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=843.133s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're in our ordinances, you know, if need be, we're updating to say, yes, food trucks are allowed on the public way, but in order to do that, you have to fill out this license application.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=854.356s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And on the use of the public way side that goes to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=857.523s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the DPW commissioner or the chief of police to sign off on traffic safety metrics or something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=1151.394s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The process is to obtain a license from the Health Division of the Inspectional Services Department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=1155.735s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that's administrative, Malden, similar, Board of Health, Cambridge, inspections by city staff, and then submission to Cambridge license.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=1169.79s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that we're going to be able to move forward with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=1170.871s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, commission, so it makes me optimistic that there's a path forward here where this can be administrative task, and we don't have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=1177.114s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also think you know, as always, Councilors Scarpelli's point is well taken, and that's why I'm glad that we're targeting the intent of this ordinance at one day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=1183.198s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Food truck vendors and hopefully We can find a simplified path towards that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2201.245s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2204.826s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Give me a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2205.407s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm organizing my thoughts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2216.111s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You go first, then I'll go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2705.297s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have a comment I'd like to make, which could be an alternate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2718.187s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2719.088s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2725.768s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2726.149s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we've gotten out of scope here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2730.935s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Among other things, I'd like for us to be getting close to a point of resolution on this project, and I think that perhaps there is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2741.307s">[Kit Collins]</a>: um, value in a conversation about this issue of does City Council adjudicate, um, licenses being issued over on school custodian property?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2754.051s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, but we're getting out of our scope here and I and I think that there's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2758.512s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to move forward on this ordinance without having to wade through all of the weeds on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2763.094s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do think that's a separate conversation, maybe one that informs this, but I think that the intent for the council here for many months has been to streamline the process for one day food truck vendors, and I don't want us to have to go through that process in order to finish up here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2783.704s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In my perspective, I think what we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2787.998s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What I would like to see is an amendment to the city council ordinances that says, yes, we allow one day food truck vendors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2796.842s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's some language in there that says, here's how we make sure it's a one day permit and not a one day that happens six days out of the week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2806.866s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Maybe it's the permitting authority, or sorry, the licensing authority may<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2812.848s">[Kit Collins]</a>: submit like one day licenses but only you know one per vendor for a three or six month period or something like that so we make sure that these are indeed one day licenses and not de facto you know all week round permits to Councilor Scarpelli's point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2830.701s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It seems to me that the overall formula here<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2834.116s">[Kit Collins]</a>: for conditions that must be satisfied to get a license is permission from the custodian or the private property owner plus adherence to Board of Health regulations and other public safety regulations equals the one day license.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2852.941s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2856.718s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Maybe I'm wrong about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2857.778s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think that there's a path forward here where we could try to make some progress on the text of what's before us, perhaps modeling, simplifying what's before us along those lines, modeling some of the language around who creates the regulations for the licenses based off of our outdoor dining ordinance, which has already been passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2884.088s">[Kit Collins]</a>: maybe that can be drafted perhaps by a member of this council, we could come back and then have legal review of that document as opposed to, I think we've gone through several rounds here and I think the context is very helpful and of course we appreciate Attorney Stein's time spent on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2899.701s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think we're all very eager to get this to a simpler place and proceed from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2907.548s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I wonder if there's a way we can kind of scale this back to the basics and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=2913.24s">[Kit Collins]</a>: convene again as a council to make sure that we're locked in on the basics, and then have another meeting after legal review, where we finalize this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=3648.091s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=3650.632s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would be happy to put that into a form of a motion unless we feel that the discussion has proceeded along enough that the suggestion is now irrelevant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=3657.877s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But barring that, I would make the motion to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=3663.007s">[Kit Collins]</a>: authorize myself or President Bears to take a pass at a redrafting of this along the lines of this conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=3738.187s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=3751.02s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I thank my, especially newer Councilors for wading into this perhaps unexpectedly complicated topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=3760.066s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Appreciate Attorney Stein's time on this call and in preparing for this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YorlYaO9Sys&t=3764.449s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I would motion to keep the paper in committee and adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=9.844s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=384.374s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=385.495s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you to my colleagues again for everyone's recommendations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=390.977s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It was great to kick off this discussion at our first committee of the whole on topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=395.559s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Looking over the compiled recommendations from us all, I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=401.662s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There are some, I think, clear avenues for consolidating this, even just looking at category one of preventing budget cuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=408.148s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think the other way that I would characterize this grouping of suggestions is around maintaining level service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=417.176s">[Kit Collins]</a>: within the Schools Department, within the Board of Health, which Councilor Tseng just noted, within the Library Department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=424.82s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then I think that this also characterizes kind of this shared priority of preventing the loss of positions that are currently grant funded within the Board of Health, within the Office of Outreach Prevention, and within the Planning, Development, and Sustainability Department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=440.367s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I do believe that across all of our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=444.149s">[Kit Collins]</a>: contributions, most of us in some way phrased that same recommendation around meet the school's budget request, meet the library budget request, don't cut any positions within Board of Health, Office of Prevention and Outreach, Planning Department, even if it means, and perhaps especially if it means finding a way to fit those positions into the operating budget or shift them over to other sources of grant funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=469.103s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I would put forward that I do believe there is consensus<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=473.065s">[Kit Collins]</a>: around all of the numbered points under category one, and I think that those can be consolidated into a maintaining level service for schools, libraries, Board of Health, and planning departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=498.295s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=508.712s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sure, I'll improv it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=511.594s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The motion would be to consolidate all of the bullet points under category one into the recommendation to maintain level service for the schools<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=529.389s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Libraries, Board of Health, Prevention and Outreach, PDS Department, including maintaining all currently grant-funded positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=542.283s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And Mr. Clerk, I can email that to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=676.954s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's a new hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=680.656s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=681.096s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanted to respond quickly to say I think Councilor Scarpelli's point is well taken and I think that it's, I think that we have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=689.676s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, as usual, somewhat of a challenging needle to thread here where, of course, I think it's absolutely not the message to send to say, we care about these cuts and not those cuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=699.039s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli is absolutely right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=700.56s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's, that's, you know, and I hope it would go without saying that's that's not the message that this council would want to be sending.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=708.303s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But unfortunately, you know, we're placed in this difficult position of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=714.235s">[Kit Collins]</a>: knowing that cuts are likely to be proposed somewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=717.797s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think maybe it would be better to articulate in some fashion, maybe elsewhere in the packet, that the council will ultimately vote dissent to the mayor, that certain departments or positions<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=732.906s">[Kit Collins]</a>: whatever this council decides that they will be, are highlighted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=736.31s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, in this case, I think many of us mentioned the schools department and the library department, because often that is where cuts are proposed, and that is where level service is not funded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=749.302s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know, just speaking only for myself, that's why I prioritize those in my memo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=753.686s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=755.167s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, a discussion point for this council is how to make sure that we target our recommendations towards those departments that we know are usually the most vulnerable, while saying, of course, we're gonna, at the same time, we're advocating for level service citywide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=770.035s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I just wanted to offer that to say I agree with Councilor Scartelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1215.826s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1218.429s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that there is also substantial<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1221.835s">[Kit Collins]</a>: overlap, kind of a clustering for many of our contributions around the issue of budgeted amount for city solicitor and assistant city solicitor salaries, as well as funding for salaries within the elections department that's split I think between<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1243.743s">[Kit Collins]</a>: category two and category three in the memo that you provided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1247.205s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just flagging that again as something that I think there is a ponderance of interest in from this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1257.05s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That was you know of course I'm a little biased that was one of my individual recommendations was to raise the salary of the city solicitor and the assistant city solicitor salaries to be more competitive with our municipal neighbors and to raise the salary budgeted for an elections<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1273.098s">[Kit Collins]</a>: director to that of a director level position so as to attract more competitive candidates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1279.763s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But to me, I think that there's pretty close to consensus from the individual recommendations that we received a couple weeks ago to put that forward as one or two of our additional recommendations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1293.093s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'd be curious to hear from my fellow councillors if we would want to put legal salaries and elections director salaries forward as two more of our recommendations to the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1887.916s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just adding my note of assent, I would also support putting that forward as a recommendation at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1893.558s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this Council has spoken before about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1898.82s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, how many other problems that touches and exacerbates city side in terms of staffing and departmental function?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=1905.763s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think, you know, the time to start advocating for progress towards a solution is the sooner the better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=2229.764s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=2230.924s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate this exchange around the Finance Department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=2234.347s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Neil Yu, I'll second the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=2237.188s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I agree with all that's been stated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=2238.909s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that, you know, obviously it is not one or the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=2242.372s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think being a member of the Administration and Finance Committee this term and also in the past one, we've had many, I think,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=2250.447s">[Kit Collins]</a>: very revealing conversations with the current finance director about the ways in which the software really is a problem right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=2257.231s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And of course, I think it is very obvious that staffing is also an issue and that the two exacerbate the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=2265.455s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think that the phrasing we've worked towards strikes the right balance of acknowledging both.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=2270.898s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=2338.697s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=2341.278s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Before you read them back, I just want to kind of note my support for keeping our list of recommendations short and sweet this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=2351.182s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's kind of going against my own instinct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=2355.803s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I remember my first year on the council, the wish list that I submitted for our first committee of the whole on this topic was amounted to the hundreds of millions of dollars and ideas for how to make our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=2368.985s">[Kit Collins]</a>: city more functional and shore up all of our critical departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=2376.37s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm extremely compelled by and sympathetic to all of the other recommendations that I also submitted two weeks ago and agree with everything that's been submitted by my fellow councillors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=2389.258s">[Kit Collins]</a>: At the same time, I think that we're going into this knowing that this is going to be a difficult budget season after a couple of difficult budget seasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=2396.926s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that there is a power that comes from having a very succinct list and saying, you know, we've done the hard work and we've really considered<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=2409.278s">[Kit Collins]</a>: what needs to be in that short list of things that we cannot go without in this budget cycle, even though we know it is going to be a hard one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=2417.564s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And what I appreciate about this group of three that we've put together is that to me it's about level service,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=2429.304s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think over the past couple of years, we've had many important public discussions about the difference between level service and level funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=2436.189s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And what the residents and city staff deserve is level service, not level funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=2441.053s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think that this list prioritizes that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=2443.074s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think it gets at the heart of the staffing and funding infusions that need to happen so that we can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=2454.202s">[Kit Collins]</a>: stop regressing in certain departments and start to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=2458.246s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, I think here on the city council we see that the most with the legal department, or lack thereof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=2463.991s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think that these few recommendations that we put together so far kind of strike at<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=2471.258s">[Kit Collins]</a>: what we really need to see in order to be functional as a body and functional as a city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=2475.201s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Of course, if other councilors have recommendations of things that they need to be on the short list, I'm sure I'll find those ideas compelling, but I just wanted to note advocacy for a short, tight list this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wtwrOMEbog0&t=2487.789s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=57.52s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Councilor Leming, and thank you again for facilitating this meeting in the chambers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=62.325s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I apologize that I can't be there in person today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=64.267s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for taking up the mantle of calling on people in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=67.59s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I truly appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=70.152s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just to quickly introduce the topic before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=73.515s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is an exciting day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=74.415s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a red letter day, actually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=76.056s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is our first committee meeting about the zoning paper, which I think as most folks here and probably watching are aware, this is something that the Council has advocated for and advocated for funding for over the course of several terms now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=91.241s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Late last term, we finalized the zoning consultants that we've been working with longitudinally for this zoning overhaul reconfiguration project, Emily Innis and associates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=102.126s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just to quickly run through, you know, a draft agenda for this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=106.708s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm hoping to give Emily and her team a chance to introduce themselves to the committee for the first time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=113.051s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm hoping that we can get into kind of an overview of the zoning overhaul that's before us, run over a kind of draft list of our top issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=122.361s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And of course, we have a lot of fertile ground to pull from our comprehensive plan, our housing production plan, our climate action adaptation plan, all of these really thoroughly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=135.134s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thoroughly developed, you know, plans that have come out of years of community outreach across various departments of the city that will be really great fodder for the work that we're going to do in the council in terms of making those priorities those goals manifest in an updated zoning code and updated zoning map.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=152.521s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But the work before us is to take those lofty goals and see how we can break them into themes, into coherent themes, into bite-sized chunks, and then to figure out a timeline so that we can get through as much of that work as possible in this term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=167.064s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So after we hear an introduction from Emily Innis and associates, I'm hoping that we can, as a council, start to have that conversation about taking those shared priorities, grouping them into categories,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=180.587s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and beginning a conversation about what from our current governing agenda or other priorities fit into the scope of zoning and beginning to sketch out the timeline through which we might approach this work this term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=194.041s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But first, I'll pass it off to Emily and her team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=954.873s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=957.455s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Really appreciate this beginning to the discussion from my fellow councilors and, you know, in the, you know, roughly 40-45 minutes that we have here today, I think that one great use of our time might be to start, of course, you know, we're not going to do anything<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=971.989s">[Kit Collins]</a>: final tonight, but I think it could be a good use of our time to make this concrete for ourselves and also for residents to, you know, we can take a look at our governing agenda, we can pull out specific policies that councillors feel are priorities from the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan, from the Comprehensive Plan, and looking at that slide from Emily, we can start to say, okay, green score, this looks like it would fit into the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=998.983s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For example, climate resiliency, citywide policy, and here's when we're thinking of starting that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=1003.625s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Does that make sense for that particular policy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=1005.945s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Does that fit there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=1006.706s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Would it have a better fit there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=1007.746s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we have a lot that we are trying to do by the end of June 2025.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=1015.328s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's going to be here before we know it for all of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=1018.849s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think the more quickly we can get concrete about what we all consent to work on together,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=1024.711s">[Kit Collins]</a>: at what point in the year the better position we'll be in to accomplish our goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=1030.213s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just as kind of an invitation to my fellow councillors, you know, for the time that we have together this evening, if there are specific policies from our governing agenda or new proposals on the brain, I think that we should feel free to voice those and put them on the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=2694.943s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Chairwoman, I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=2696.484s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I appreciate Councilor Scarpelli's note just now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=2700.648s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think as we get into the more neighborhood-based planning part of this process, certainly we should consider having some of these committee meetings perhaps located in the neighborhoods that they'll be affecting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=2711.096s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that that used to be something that before my time on the Council, the Council would occasionally hold committees of the whole out in the real world, outside of the chambers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=2718.982s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that might be an appropriate thing to consider when we're<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=2723.545s">[Kit Collins]</a>: doing neighborhood-specific zoning changes later in the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=2727.367s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I just wanted to underscore a point that's already been made, but that I think is really important, is that we have so many ideas and high-level policies to go on that are already, you know, the result of these months and months and years of community meetings about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=2742.775s">[Kit Collins]</a>: what we want to see in the community and what the zoning is that could bring those about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=2747.537s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Those ideas from community members, those proposals from residents and from business owners, those were not, the point of those ideas is not to live in a plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=2755.999s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The point of those ideas is to be put into our zoning ordinances so that our city can evolve to be more what we envision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=2762.502s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so I just say, I think it's important for us to go into this process and also for residents who are perhaps<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=2769.784s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, rejoining this effort, you know, for the first time in several months or years to know that, you know, this is the intent of this Council is to take the will of the community that has been expressed in part through these plans that have already been published, you know, and do the good work of making sure that those are actually going to become a reality in our community through the changes that we're going to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=2791.98s">[Kit Collins]</a>: With just, you know, about 10 or 15 minutes left here, I know President Bears mentioned that he had a couple motions in mind, so I'll defer to him, but I think for me the most important thing, kind of pivoting to thinking about next steps, we have penciled in that we will revisit this topic again at a couple meetings in October, I'm sorry, in April on the 10th and the 24th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=2815.32s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it would be really great progress, if starting on the 10th, we have a better idea of what those kind of smaller tweaks to change in the zoning ordinances are based on feedback from city staff, and I would<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=2833.28s">[Kit Collins]</a>: especially support a motion to have Councilors submit their specific proposals, ideas from the governing agenda, from our various plans, new proposals to council leadership and the PBS team so that those can be compiled and we can review that as a team at our next committee meeting on this topic and move forward from there with the timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=3268.334s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=3268.734s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll let President Bears complete his motions and then I'll jump in if I have any remaining after that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=3309.245s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Chair Lemaine, I'll second these motions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=3318.187s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll second the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=3441.043s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=3443.408s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it will advantage us to think ahead about what we're going to be talking about when, both in the short term and in the long term, kind of we've been talking long term tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=3452.43s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think, I imagine it will be to the advantage of Finnis Associates, which is doing most of the research and homework and prep for these meetings, if we came out ahead of time, what we at least intend to work on, even if there's a couple of options, we know that we're going to get to all of it eventually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=3466.294s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think, especially with these couple of motions on the table, that puts us in good shape to have a more granular discussion on the 10th about what we aspire to work on when, and to have a more specific conversation about, for example, what do we mean when we say we're going to work on commercial development before September 2024?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=3483.204s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What's involved in that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=3484.365s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What framework governing agenda is on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=3486.626s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What areas of the city are we talking about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=3489.147s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that that'll be a really productive discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=3491.789s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think with everything that we're trying to get done before September,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=3496.172s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We should, we should continue quickly to actually getting into the weeds on those policy areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=3502.176s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I wonder if, you know, doing all of this work, requesting all this feedback from city staff and Councilors submitting ideas for inclusion on this draft timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=3513.824s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in time for our April 10th meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=3518.066s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Jumping off of the discussion that we've had today, which has been pretty high level, I think that we could be ambitious and try to touch both on draft timeline and then start to get into the weeds on economic development on the 10th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=3529.671s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If we don't get to it, then we can plan to talk about economic development and some climate resiliency goals on the 24th, and perhaps sketch out the top lines for our May meetings as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=3706.052s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Chair Lehmann.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=3708.315s">[Kit Collins]</a>: With those motions behind us, I just wanted to thank Innes Associates, the whole team, for the first time joining us in committee to talk about the zoning revocation, sorry, the zoning overhaul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=3720.548s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm like 2022 over here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=3724.946s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As we've all stated, really excited to be continuing this project with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=3729.587s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know we're going to spend many evenings in the chambers and on Zoom together, putting all of these ideas and proposals and changes into our zoning code.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=3738.95s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are really glad to have you, speaking for myself, very glad to have you on board, excited to be doing this process with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=3744.051s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for your time tonight and your preparation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=3747.512s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And thank you to my colleagues for coming prepared to kick off this project, which will certainly dominate the work of this committee this term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=3757.92s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would motion to keep the paper in committee and adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjJJRZXm810&t=3789.551s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=424.786s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm happy to defer to a presentation by a member of the administration, President Bearsford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=751.971s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=754.593s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you to my fellow Councilors for their comments on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=758.557s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just want to note that this is the second time that a Stabilization Fund paper has come before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=763.061s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Last year, the administration submitted a similar but different paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=766.505s">[Kit Collins]</a>: At that time, we decided that creating that structure and making a large appropriation all in one fell swoop was not the right timing for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=774.572s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This time, the paper comes to us<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=776.514s">[Kit Collins]</a>: After months of ongoing discussions about this city's financial future, those discussions must and will continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=782.739s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do believe that it is the best practice for cities like Medford to have a rainy day fund, in the same way that many households have a rainy day fund for unforeseen emergencies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=793.326s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that this is an appropriate time to create the structure and then subsequently have those conversations about how much is appropriate to put into the fund and when, because this paper does not call for an appropriation, simply the creation of the structure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=806.052s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also want to note this, to just reemphasize, there's no money changing accounts in this paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=814.856s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If there were to be, it would be a reappropriation of money already in the city's coffers and the community's coffers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=821.039s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that this is the right time to set up the structure and then again have those community conversations about how much it makes sense to put into that rainy day fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=828.163s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And when the next time we have these community wide emergencies come up, we are better prepared to take care of Medford residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=834.147s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would motion for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7174.226s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7175.287s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to thank Councilor Leming for co-sponsoring this proposal with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7182.072s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll try to be as brief as I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7183.934s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Housing affordability, unaffordability continues to displace Medford residents from where we grew up, went to school, the communities that we worship in, study, have community ties where we go to work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7195.062s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is becoming more and more out of the question for working class and middle class people to live here, and no one is going to swoop in and fix that for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7202.495s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that Medford residents deeply value being a welcoming and diverse community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7206.964s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The question is, are we willing to have the conversations and utilize the tools that will help us keep it that way?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7212.648s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If we want our Affordable Housing Trust Fund to be more than a talking point, we know that we need to create dedicated funding streams so that it can manifest in housing and programs that will make it possible for us to keep Medford residents in Medford and for us to welcome new neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7227.804s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Real estate transfer fees are one tool that the Governor has indicated provisional support for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7232.189s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's why we're proposing to consider it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7235.171s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Our methods for meaningfully funding affordable housing are too few and far between to dismiss this out of hand, and our existing funding streams, including CPA, are unfortunately insufficient on their own.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7246.263s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The scale is too great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7247.744s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Displacement is already happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7250.583s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As Councilwoman said, what's before us tonight is whether we want to have the conversation about how to tailor this tool to dedicate a small percentage of only the highest ticket real estate transactions towards the most underinvested in housing in our community, the housing we desperately need and have a very severe shortage of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7268.444s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to be clear, if we vote this into committee tonight, then we can and we will get into the weeds with the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7274.806s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We can discuss how to tailor this to affect the appropriate type of highest value sales so as to capture a small percentage of the huge value increases that have come into this region as living in Medford and places like it has become more expensive and more desirable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7290.951s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We can consider exceptions, like for elders, for people making transfers to close family, or for people selling at a loss or at minimal profit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7298.781s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Essentially, we can go through what would need to happen in order for this to be a net positive for this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7305.697s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then I want to remind everybody, this would need approval from the mayor, our state delegation, as well as the governor for this to actually take effect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7314.004s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to be really clear, we are not implementing a tax tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7317.867s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are proposing to send this idea to committee to start a conversation, and I believe it is a very necessary conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7324.513s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I thank my fellow councilors and the public for their time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7328.436s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I will motion for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11430.034s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know what, I'll follow up with Mr. Castagnetti after the meeting to thank him for sending along that New York Times Post article.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11437.979s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11438.88s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I just think it speaks to the point that we need to be pursuing every tool at our disposal when it comes to affordable housing that can work for everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=20187.213s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=20188.655s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, this is an ordinance that I've worked on over my terms and city council I believe this is an exercise and compromise is the result of what we have put forward over a couple years of working on this hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=20204.48s">[Kit Collins]</a>: strong opposition to the idea of regulating these devices and also very strong support for the idea of mitigating these devices that we know cause significant air pollution and also noise pollution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=20215.523s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What we've arrived at is an ordinance that seeks to provide some reasonable constraints around which devices can be used,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=20224.446s">[Kit Collins]</a>: at what times of the day, where, and phases out the most polluting versions of these devices, gas-powered, for residential and commercial users over different timescales over the next several years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=20234.693s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do have one motion before we vote, which is Section 3858, subsection 2,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=20241.934s">[Kit Collins]</a>: think that the word continuous should be removed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=20244.897s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A constituent got in touch and indicated that this created kind of a loophole that was counter to the goals of this section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=20254.486s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that would be to remove the word continuous from section 3858 subsection 2 before we vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=20265.914s">[Kit Collins]</a>: section 38, 58, and then numeral two in that section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=16.528s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=45.702s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Chair Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=49.606s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I apologize for having to be virtual tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=51.287s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Can everybody hear me okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=56.108s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=57.229s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let me know if the volume goes in and out at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=62.53s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you for...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=65.902s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Having this be our main topic for tonight, I'm hoping that this will be a pretty straightforward discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=70.785s">[Kit Collins]</a>: First, I'll offer a brief introduction, and then I can run us through the draft ordinance before us that I'm hoping we can use as a jumping off point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=79.611s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Open it up to, you know, love to hear any comments from my fellow Councilors at this preliminary stage, comments from the community, and figure out some next steps that make sense for this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=89.998s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So the idea for a wildlife feeding ordinance came up based on some outreach from constituents that I got over the course of the year last year, talking about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=101.383s">[Kit Collins]</a>: some issues arising from overfeeding of wildlife in some of Medford's denser residential areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=108.985s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Looking around a little bit more, given the characteristics of some of Medford's denser residential neighborhoods, this is an issue that can cause public health nuisances whenever we have these<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=125.683s">[Kit Collins]</a>: areas of the city with homes close together, if there's overfeeding of wildlife, we have permeable borders between our various homes and backyards and porches in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=134.148s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So the intent of this is to give the Board of Health and Code Enforcement the ordinance tools that they need in order to issue warnings, tickets, potentially fines, whenever there's an issue arising from overfeeding of wildlife that neighbors cannot resolve amongst themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=150.498s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do want to emphasize that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=153.757s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The intent here is just to empower code enforcement to step in when it's necessary to reduce a nuisance that's in line with other goals of the Board of Health and Code Enforcement to make sure that residents' enjoyment of the outdoors is enhanced and not limited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=169.145s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I want to be really clear from the beginning, this is not about saying you can't have a bird feeder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=172.827s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is about saying if there's feeding going on that's causing too many seagulls or pigeons or raccoons or rats<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=181.132s">[Kit Collins]</a>: on somebody else's property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=182.294s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's something that if neighbors can't sort that out amongst themselves, then co-enforcement needs to be able to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=188.38s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this, I have a draft ordinance for us to look at as a jumping off point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=193.023s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This language is based on several other communities ordinances that have similar goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=200.687s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The one that this is modeled most closely on is Westford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=205.789s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So, Chair Lazzaro, if it's okay with you, I can run through the draft ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=209.151s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'd be happy to share my screen, or if you'd like to, I can follow along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=219.453s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That'd be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=220.734s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=221.354s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Hang on one second, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=239.262s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=239.722s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Can everybody see where it says Wildlife Feeding Ordinance Draft 2.13?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=247.703s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=251.758s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'll just go through this pretty quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=253.259s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This was in councilor's packets for this week, so I'm sure this isn't the first time that my colleagues are seeing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=260.422s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Standard ordinance format.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=261.702s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Up top, we start with purpose and intent, stating that Medford is, of course, as we all know and as we all cherish, Medford is home to a large population of wild animals, including rats, pigeons, bulls, and raccoons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=273.107s">[Kit Collins]</a>: However, feeding such wildlife, whether on purpose or through neglect, can entice and attract wild animals onto private property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=281.491s">[Kit Collins]</a>: porches, backyards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=283.552s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And again, the emphasis here is on feeding occurring on one lot that is having adverse effects for either that lot or neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=293.916s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But limiting the practice of feeding wildlife, whether intentionally or passively, and enforcing this prohibition, the city can help limit a major factor that entices wildlife into resident areas of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=304.521s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Again, not anti-wildlife.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=306.082s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We just want to make sure that every organism stays where it's most healthy for it to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=311.983s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have a definition section just to make it clear what this is targeted towards and what it is not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=318.645s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that the more useful thing in this section is going into some detail about what constitutes feeding, and based on some of the issues that this ordinance project arose out of, I think it's important to know that feeding doesn't just mean intentionally distributing food for wildlife, but potentially leaving inappropriate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=340.287s">[Kit Collins]</a>: wildlife food out in an area where realistically varmints are going to get to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=346.21s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So section C, prohibited activity, no person shall feed any wildlife as defined above, nor distribute or scatter any foodstuffs in or on any private place or, sorry, any public place or private property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=359.938s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this is a thing that we should not do because we know that it attracts wild animals into residential areas of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=367.78s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to highlight some of the exceptions that are going in in this early draft of the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=372.962s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Nothing in this section shall be interpreted so as to prohibit bird feeders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=377.424s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There is an exception to the exception.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=379.705s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If it is appearing that a bird feeder is the cause of a public safety threat or nuisance, then perhaps the enforcing officer will step in and say, here's the cause of a nuisance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=390.35s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This must be resolved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=391.29s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that I personally have never heard of a case where a bird feeder is causing an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=396.998s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This also states, nothing in this section shall be interpreted so as to prohibit the feeding of pets, provided that if food for pets is determined to be the source of wildlife feeding, then in that case, if it's causing an issue, that person may be directed to make sure that that food is no longer accessible to wildlife.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=417.113s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It also states, nothing in this section shall be interpreted to prohibit the storage of food products, pet food or any other material where it's not constituting an attraction to wildlife.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=426.333s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=428.069s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If a reasonable usage is resulting in an adverse effect, then in that case, if it's reported, if it's deemed to be an issue, the enforcing officer may say, this isn't necessarily an issue, but in this case, it's causing wildlife to come into your property or neighbor's property to an extent that is causing harm or might cause harm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=445.407s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then they might order them to remove it and store it in a more secure way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=449.96s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Getting down to enforcement, I thought it'd be appropriate for the animal control officer, the health director, the code enforcement officers and their designees to share administration and enforcement of this ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=463.109s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There are some other wildlife-related enforcement responsibilities that the health director already has.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=469.873s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Obviously, this touches the purview of the animal control officer and code enforcement officers are often called upon to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=478.21s">[Kit Collins]</a>: administer some of these nuisance-related issues on public and private property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=484.133s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'd be curious to hear feedback from city staff on that, but I thought that was an appropriate place to start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=490.856s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And finally, in terms of penalties for non-compliance, it is my hope that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=498.732s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But again, the goal of this, I think, is not to say, oh, you did something wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=504.255s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well, gosh, we'll ticket you immediately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=506.016s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=506.276s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The point of this is to provide a recourse for when something is going wrong and neighbors aren't able to resolve it amongst themselves immediately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=513.199s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I would hope that, as with our other ordinances at the discretion of the enforcing officers, sometimes this is a warning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=519.222s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sometimes this is a written warning, an oral warning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=521.864s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sometimes it escalates to a ticket if the issue is really not getting resolved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=525.665s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And in that case,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=527.926s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, based on that, I have in this first draft, first offense is a written warning from an enforcing officer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=534.069s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Second offense, $50 ticket.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=535.77s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Third and subsequent offenses, $100 ticket.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=538.291s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And of course, per MGL, we are not able to charge more than a $300 ticket, I believe, for any civil code violation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=547.254s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think it makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=548.215s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Again, this is supposed to be a deterrent, not something punitive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=553.397s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I thought this could be good to hear my fellow Councilors' feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=557.116s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm not part of the audience and anything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=560.86s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also want to note before I stop talking and let my fellow Councilors respond to that, at our last meeting of the Public Health and Community Safety Committee, I did<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=572.612s">[Kit Collins]</a>: mentioned this ordinance, and as a follow-up, the clerk did circulate the ordinance to my fellow councilors and to relevant city staff requesting their feedback by March 15th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=582.76s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That was when I thought that the next meeting of this committee was going to be in April.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=586.042s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The council meeting schedule changed since then, so the word has already been put out to relevant city staff to get their comment on that, and we'll be sure to have it by the next time that we meet on this ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=596.55s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=865.831s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=866.853s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I really appreciate my fellow Councilors initial reactions to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=871.021s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for taking this project so thoughtfully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=878.945s">[Kit Collins]</a>: initial reaction to the questions around, and I think it's a really good question, like how does this intersect with efforts to make sure that wildcats are attracted so that they can be spayed and neutered, which is important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=891.914s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's a couple areas in the ordinance, and I appreciate Councilor Callaghan for speaking to this, where it might be covered, but I think that that would be a great thing to put to our animal control officer, as well as to have legal counsel take a look at when they do their review of this, just to make sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=909.487s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that that should be would be interpreted the way that we intend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=912.495s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And again, the intent of this is to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=919.628s">[Kit Collins]</a>: make sure that there's a recourse for when something is causing an issue, that there's a way for the code enforcement officer to step in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=927.113s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think that this is creating a good succinct list of questions to follow up with our staff and experts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=936.278s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I would also be happy to, I'll probably make some motions at the end of our discussion, I'd also be happy to make sure that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=942.862s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the Medford-based group, Kitty Connection, sees a copy of this just to make sure that it is on their radars as folks in the community who do work with wildlife.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=952.624s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=971.707s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Chair Lazzaro?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=979.502s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=979.942s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll answer to either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=980.643s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would make a motion to refer this version of the ordinance to KP Law for a legal review prior to our next meeting on the topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=993.193s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That would be my first motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=1037.711s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=1038.231s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have two more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=1040.031s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Second motion would be to have the city clerk recirculate this document to the relevant city staff, along with the questions that came out of this committee discussion, mainly around if this covers putting out food to trap feral cats for spaying and neutering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V64stR284Pc&t=1057.054s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then I would also motion to keep this paper in committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=381.93s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=383.37s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Essentially, what I put in my memo speaks to my recommendations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=387.231s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My priority is for this budget cycle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=390.492s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is not going to be a budget year where I think that we are having the bandwidth to pilot a lot of new programs or start a lot of new positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=402.575s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My focus is on maintaining level service for constituents and for students and workers in school systems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=410.196s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's why my number one and number two priorities are meeting the school department budget request and meeting the library department budget request, making sure that we maintain level service and hours of operation at the library in particular, because that has been something that has been called into question in some past budget cycles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=429.76s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I wanted to call out specifically grant-funded personnel in the Health Department, Office of Outreach and Prevention, and the Planning Department because there are a lot of grant-funded positions in those departments specifically, but we know that all those positions are critical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=443.686s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In our community, they serve really important functions and the needs for those roles are not going away just because pandemic-era funding and grant funding is going away, so we need to make sure that we are maintaining level service by<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=458.273s">[Kit Collins]</a>: rolling those positions either onto other sources of grant funding or ideally making sure that those positions can be maintained within our operations, our operating budget this year and in future years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=474.093s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The next few key priorities for this year are ones that we've talked about around this time of year in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=482.759s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Trying to get a city solicitor and an assistant city solicitor online as quickly as we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=489.963s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's my belief that we need to raise the amount budgeted for salary for those positions so that we can be attracting competitive candidates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=499.429s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do believe that this is a at this moment in time a tough position to hire for in this area in, in general, and I think that these positions are so important that we should prioritize escalating the amount of salary budgeted for these positions, so that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=516.801s">[Kit Collins]</a>: we are competitive with some of our neighboring municipalities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=519.162s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I put some recommended dollar figures on here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=524.204s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Those are based off of my research into what our neighboring communities of Malden and Somerville primarily are paying for these positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=533.987s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For example, in Malden, the budgeted salary for their city solicitor is around, it's a little over 117,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=540.289s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In Somerville, it's 189.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=546.332s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I believe that the figure I suggested to increase the city solicitor salary by less than $50,000 was based on the discrepancy with Malden.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=558.039s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is that true?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=559.9s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=560.921s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That was based off the discrepancy with the city of Somerville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=564.443s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know this is a big jump for one position, but I think we've all felt for the past few years how significant it is to not have a city solicitor in-house, and I think that that would be a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=573.977s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that we can be pound wise by investing more money into these unfilled city positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=580.641s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's the same for the assistant city solicitor and in escalating the elections manager to a direct deliver position again I think that these are things that you know we see what happens when we don't invest in making sure that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=592.307s">[Kit Collins]</a>: these positions are first and foremost filled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=595.329s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And second, you know, we really owe the people of Medford, the best possible person in all of these roles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=601.073s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then I put the secondary priorities under areas of study slash secondary priorities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=605.676s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that these are things we're not going to be able to bring online early in fiscal 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=611.6s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think that charting a course towards implementing a paid family and medical leave program for all city employees, apart from being the right thing to do and what all of our city employees deserve will help us<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=623.208s">[Kit Collins]</a>: fill key staffing roles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=625.83s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I believe that a review of what needs to happen to bring our finance department software into the 2020s is something that we would see the benefit from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=636.82s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Once we achieve that, we need to figure out if that's something that can happen in three, five, or 10 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=642.085s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that every department would feel the positive effects of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=646.909s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm hoping that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=649.727s">[Kit Collins]</a>: while not being things that I think are realistic to prioritize for fiscal 25, these are things that I hope that the administration is saving some capacity for studying this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=658.454s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2606.885s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears, and I thank all of my fellow councillors for coming into the meeting with their recommendations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2614.133s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's really exciting that we're starting this conversation in March for the first time in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2620.287s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the first time that I've been on the council, which is not that long, but I think that this conversation, this process is beginning earlier than it usually does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2627.929s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I appreciate the administration's cooperation so far with trying to make the overall budgeting process more communicative and less rushed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2638.732s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that this is a great start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2641.353s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm happy to hear that there's cohesion among a lot of us on a lot of the shared priorities, and I think that's not surprising because we hear all the same issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2648.577s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that when I think back over the past couple years of budget discussions and what the common threads that emerge are, you know, we're the funnel into which sort of the main problems and aspirations and grievances of the city<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2666.67s">[Kit Collins]</a>: comes into.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2667.691s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think the conversation that we've been having about the law department for a couple of years is an example of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2672.673s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're seeing our capacity reduced within these chambers because we lack in-house legal support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2680.517s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We see it taking a lot of time on ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2682.698s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We see legal issues coming up, like the BJ's lawsuit, as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2687.1s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think the work of this council, very productive in the past, has been to say, what's the common denominator here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2691.982s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What's the investment that we're not making that we need to make that could be the fulcrum for all this other change?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2696.244s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If we had a staffed in-house legal department, I think we would be seeing the difference in our workflow, in the quality of our workflow, and how quickly we're able to get things done, and then there would be all the things that we are not seeing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2710.883s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All of the decisions that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2713.208s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's hard to make, or we have to put off, or we have to request from an outside legal perspective, and they're not super accountable to their timelines, to our timelines, because they don't work for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2724.016s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's all the negatives that we don't see because of a targeted investment, in addition to all the positives that we do start to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2730.2s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's still that common denominator that we're still looking for that targeted investment there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2734.663s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think the other one that this conversation, um, I would say over the past six months is also revealing is needed investments to the finance department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2742.667s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think president bears put it very well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2744.888s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's all these positives that we would start to see if we brought our financial software and staffing up to year 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2750.711s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then there's all these negatives that once we stop having these problems and inefficiencies and, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2760.193s">[Kit Collins]</a>: deleted results that come from a severe shortage of staffing and outdated software.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2771.258s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We won't know it when those problems start to go away, but we're certainly seeing them now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2775.72s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it's exciting to me to see multiple voices in this room,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2780.484s">[Kit Collins]</a>: noticing the same problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2781.604s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that we're identifying another area, like the legal department, that we really need the administration to target some investment into.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2788.067s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that it's hard to contemplate in this financial environment, making a multi-million dollar investment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2795.83s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But as President Beer said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2799.571s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're already spending a lot, not just in money, but in staff time on trying to use inefficient processes to do this work that we have to do anyway, and dealing with the problems that arise from doing it less efficiently than we have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2816.521s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I hope that that can be a topic that we really elevate this budget season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2821.944s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Again, this is a year when I think we have to be realistic, but I think that this is so foundational to so many departments that we can't afford to not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2832.27s">[Kit Collins]</a>: prioritize the issue and at least try to get some, you know, in my recommendations, I put it forward as an area of study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2839.274s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Can we at least invest in a consultant to look at our software and say, here's a plan for how to get there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2847.219s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Can we at least start there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2848.34s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If not looking at what would it look to really divert some funding into an investment in this fiscal year and know that that's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2857.714s">[Kit Collins]</a>: something that might feel short-term uncomfortable, but we have to think about the long-term downstream positive effects of that kind of investment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=2863.316s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3735.304s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3737.105s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My preference in terms of where we go from here, I think that we built in a couple of weeks to move from individual council recommendations to full council recommendations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3751.168s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this meeting put us in a pretty good,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3755.06s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that there's a very clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3756.721s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Ben diagram.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3757.381s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's a lot of stuff in the middle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3759.383s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Personally I would be comfortable with the process where either this kind of informal document is shared out by the clerk to all Councilors and Councilors get back to the clerk with perhaps a ranking of their.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3770.67s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Top five, which as council leadership, you or I could assimilate into a document for us to vote on in a future committee of the whole, um, I think that it would be a pretty similar process if, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3783.72s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, I think that we could, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3784.7s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yourself for myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3785.101s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um just took a stab at, you know, tallying up what was submitted the most times make a version of that document, and then we could similarly look at it as a group at a future committee of the whole and then make some final decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3796.886s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um that evening and still have plenty of time to submit it before the 22nd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3800.908s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just think that that will be, um, give Councilors time to digest, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3813.795s">[Kit Collins]</a>: without some time to order our rankings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=4077.025s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=4077.285s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's an important question, especially for the folks for whom this is the first budget season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=4083.61s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I appreciate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=4086.991s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears' overview of what I think is a reasonable way to approach this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=4093.348s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In terms of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=4094.83s">[Kit Collins]</a>: what I would propose we, you know, what we literally send to the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=4098.432s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I believe that what we did last year, probably the year before that as well, we go through this process of Councilors submitting individual recommendations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=4108.179s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We talk about our shared priorities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=4109.7s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We come to some form of consensus about, we all come in with our individual rankings, individual priorities, and we find what is the middle of that Venn diagram.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=4120.367s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What are the things that we're going to say?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=4123.068s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's 30 things we want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=4125.384s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're going to ask for five and hopefully get one or two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=4130.506s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And trying to hone in on those shared areas of most importance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=4139.689s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that's, I think, the first page of the packet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=4142.35s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then I think what we did last year was we also included every Councilor's individual memos.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=4148.272s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I would propose that we also, of course, include the minutes of these meetings so that the administration has<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=4155.734s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, that thorough overview of our discussion, has the record of everything that we put on the table, everything that we thought was important to raise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=4163.379s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In addition to, out of all of that, here's that shorter list of things that we really have to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=4172.945s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so, in terms of next steps from here, I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=4178.922s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I believe that we have some space in the schedule to have a follow up committee of the whole to revisit this before the 22nd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=4186.026s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If fellow Councilors were amenable to it I'd be happy to make a motion for council leadership to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=4193.092s">[Kit Collins]</a>: circulate this aggregated document among fellow Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=4198.116s">[Kit Collins]</a>: By the end of the week, work to schedule a follow-up committee of the whole where we can digest it together, come up with a shared shortlist of priorities so that we can stick to that timeline of submitting it to the administration by the 22nd along with Councilors individual memos and the records of this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=4269.428s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to circulate the document for council leadership to schedule a follow-up committee of the whole where we will prioritize those ideas, and then to submit that list of priorities to the administration by the 22nd after the meeting, along with councilors' individual memos and the records of our meetings on the topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=4296.305s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=0.691s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Planning and Permanent Committee, February 28, 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=6.415s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This meeting will take place at 6 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=7.776s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in the City Council Chamber, second floor, Medford City Hall and via Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=12.8s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mr. Clerk, would you please call the roll?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=39.301s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Planning and Permitting Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=41.302s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The action and discussion item for this meeting is paper 24042, a resolution to discuss the implementation of the Housing Stability Notification Ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=54.065s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we've invited some members of the Planning, Development and Sustainability Office that are the staff that are tasked with implementing and enforcing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=66.014s">[Kit Collins]</a>: this ordinance to be with us here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=68.235s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just want to make it clear, because this is a resolution to discuss the implementation of an ordinance that was passed around this time last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=78.0s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The Housing Stability Notification Ordinance is an ordinance that was passed in February 2023 that created a new requirement for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=89.005s">[Kit Collins]</a>: property owners of properties where there are tenants, that at the beginning and end of any lease, that they should send a document that is created by the City of Medford detailing tenants' resources and tenants' rights to those tenants at those given<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=102.785s">[Kit Collins]</a>: start and end times to any lease.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=105.366s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That is the ordinance in a nutshell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=107.967s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's fairly simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=110.208s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We had a fairly lengthy process crafting the ordinance between 2022 and 2023.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=116.17s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Now it's been about a year since we passed it, so the purpose of this meeting is to check in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=120.211s">[Kit Collins]</a>: with the Planning, Development, and Sustainability Office that have been working hard, thinking about how it makes sense to roll out this ordinance, going through the necessary steps to put together that document, to draft it, to run it by legal counsel, and to be thoughtful about how to make sure that everybody in the community that ought to know about this new requirement does before we officially begin implementing and following up with people to ensure that it's being complied with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=146.424s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So with that, I'm going to open it up to preliminary comment from my fellow councillors that I'd love to hear just an overall update from our city staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=155.567s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any comments from my fellow councillors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=160.949s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Hearing none, I'd be happy to turn it over to Director of Planning, Development and Sustainability, Alicia Hunt, and our housing planner, Aditi, to give us an update on the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=176.533s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, I know that there's been a lot of good work being done in the planning office to develop this document and to think through how we're gonna roll it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=183.956s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'd love any sort of update that you can share on that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=553.354s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll quickly chime in, and then I'll turn it back over to our subject matter experts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=556.895s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My understanding, and I appreciate that question, Councilor Scarpellirilli, because I think that's an important point to clarify.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=564.019s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My understanding is this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=567.569s">[Kit Collins]</a>: ordinance adds something to that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=572.791s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So the state law creates a requirement for that document and that required notice and resources to be sent when there is a notice to quit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=580.015s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This ordinance says not necessarily just when there's an ordinance, sorry, when there's a notice to quit, but when a lease is beginning or when a lease is ending for other reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=590.019s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let's make sure<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=592.08s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=592.58s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If there's a foreclosure happening, let's make sure that the person occupying that home or about to occupy that home knows their rights and has these resources in those other scenarios as well, building on top of the state law that is specifically about notices to quit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=608.751s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Did I get that right, Director?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=681.156s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Leming?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=781.706s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=781.946s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And if I, I appreciate, um, I,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=784.969s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One of the goals of this meeting is just a general update of where we are at in rolling out the implementation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=789.13s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think the other, especially now that it's been a year since we were talking about this in public meeting, is to have these clarifying conversations about what is the intent of this and what does it do and what are the consequences and what aren't the consequences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=801.315s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So, you know, as the sponsor of the original ordinance now passed,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=808.337s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that there is nothing about the notification document that would affect eviction proceedings at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=816.726s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think that there's anything about the notification document that would... The intent of the document is to be something that can go to a tenant and say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=828.973s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Here's some info.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=830.314s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If you have an issue, here's who you can call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=833.235s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have a question, here's who you can call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=835.276s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If you have a question and this is the language you speak and it's not English, here's who you can call just to be informative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=841.42s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And the intent of that is to really make sure that people are empowered with information before they have any sort of issue or problem, which is intended to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=849.304s">[Kit Collins]</a>: beneficial for a tenant or property owner, everybody in that relationship.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=853.965s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So on the enforcement side, I don't think this would ever impact, you know, should a notice to quit be issued.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=860.287s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If there's another condition that prompts an eviction, this would not affect that timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=865.728s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think we put it very clearly in the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=868.529s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, this is something that is intended to be an informative and educational ordinance, not something that we're going to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=876.05s">[Kit Collins]</a>: looking and looking for evidence of non-compliance to issue tickets, but rather to be something that we can follow up and saying, let's make sure that everybody gets the information before they need it, and that our city staff can be working proactively to make sure that this is getting out to the community in an accessible way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=891.72s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I really appreciate the opportunity to clarify that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=895.882s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1124.557s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Alicia.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1126.658s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate that approach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1127.738s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that, like we said, the goal of this is to be informative, if we all recognize that a healthy tenant-landlord relationship is one where everybody knows what their responsibilities are and their resources are, tenants included, and know what to expect and what to expect of themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1144.162s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's the best recipe for a healthy and unproblematic relationship.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1149.684s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I saw President Bears, Councilor Leming, and then back to you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1457.191s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is that a cover your questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1682.878s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1683.318s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1683.879s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it's exciting to hear about different ways of collaborating with, you know, not just property owners, but also real estate agents in the city to make sure that all these initiatives and all the good work that I think everybody wants to be doing, that we can be staying on the same page and synthesizing about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1696.446s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll go to the housing planner and then Councilor Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1882.691s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1887.654s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bearsens, and I appreciate, you know, when we were developing this ordinance over the course of several months leading up to, I think we passed it in February 2023, most of our conversations were centered around how do we make this something that is accessible, that people can understand, that people who don't read English can language, can access in the language they understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1907.578s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Essentially, how do we make this tool that is meant to be informational, how do we make it easy to access?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1912.9s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I really appreciate, you know, now that we're talking about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1915.583s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate that City staff is taking the time to make sure that this is done right in that same spirit of we want to make sure that everybody who needs to know that this is a new requirement hears about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1926.312s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I appreciate that we're thinking through the communication channels that the city already uses, that the conversation is starting with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1933.237s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What can we use to physically get this into people's hands?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1935.919s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Because we know it's probably a fraction of all Medford residents and property owners that are on the city's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1943.709s">[Kit Collins]</a>: social media channels and accessing what local news we have left.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1947.533s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so I appreciate that those are, you know, perhaps going to be supplementary tools to getting this information out, but that primarily we're thinking through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1954.534s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, what's the best mailing to use so that this is cost-effective that we make sure that people hear about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1959.576s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I was especially happy to hear that staff is thinking in the direction of, you know, the mailing that will go out to property owners will include sort of a signal, like, there is a new requirement to send out a document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1972.182s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is not that document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1974.042s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That document lives online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1975.243s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Like, here's how to access it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1976.403s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Here's how to print it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1977.684s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Here's how to send it to the library and get it printed out, rather than sending a static document that then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1983.916s">[Kit Collins]</a>: we'll get photocopied until it's illegible or we'll get updated and people won't benefit from that updated information and so on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=1994.605s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=2061.417s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Do I have a second on the motion to keep the paper in committee and reconvene for another update, perhaps on timeline as we get later into the spring?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=2069.541s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Second from Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=2078.585s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just to reiterate, you know, the content of this meeting so far on the ongoing implementation rollout of the Housing Stability Notification Ordinance, we've had a, I think, a really helpful update from city staff where we're at with the timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=2091.189s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What are the questions still on the table for finalizing the document and then alerting everybody who ought to be alerted about it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=2097.755s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that there's some energy to try to get the document finalized and begin to roll that out, you know, this spring, by June, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=2106.522s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a committee that meets often.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=2107.743s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It meets every two weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=2109.185s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a fairly straightforward conversation because we've talked about this ordinance so many times before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=2114.534s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just say that to note that even though there's a lot of competition for meeting dates in this committee in particular, because we're doing zoning in this committee, I'm sure that this is something where we can have a quick update on an evening that's shared with other topics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=2128.943s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, oh, peanut gallery over here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=2139.449s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to keep the paper in committee seconded by<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=2143.985s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Leming, all in favor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=2145.626s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, sorry, roll call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=2153.372s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=2155.173s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You're ready.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=2160.156s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, I forgot how to call a roll call vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=2163.759s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=2176.253s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=2177.473s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Five in favor, none opposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=2179.314s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=2181.614s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is there any further comment from councilors or members of the public that would wish to speak?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=2188.157s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Or last words from city staff for now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=2192.158s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=2193.338s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seconded by President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=2194.399s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=2199.892s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And while the clerk is getting ready, I'd just like to say thank you again to Alicia and Aditi for working with us on developing this ordinance in the previous term and for doing such a thoughtful job of implementation in this one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=2211.256s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=2230.086s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=2234.109s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Matt, you got to stop doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=2246.477s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=2249.559s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HxbPqtm-S9M&t=2250.359s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=898.814s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=899.954s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thanks as always for being here and collaborating on this with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=903.316s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Same to the Chief of Staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=905.076s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just to echo what my colleagues just shared, I think the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=913.851s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, I certainly share the concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=917.194s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's very important to not be legislating something that we don't know is within our capacity or beyond our capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=922.438s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I definitely appreciate the focus on that as we're still crafting this in draft form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=929.944s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I completely agree to me the intent of the language that's currently in that section of the ordinance is just to create kind of some sort of timestamp for a check-in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=941.432s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know the term report usually connotated as like a very structured, very detailed, like it must have X, Y, and Z type of document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=951.735s">[Kit Collins]</a>: To me, the intent is just to make sure that once a year we have some kind of record of here's where we were last year, here's where we are this year in terms of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=964.915s">[Kit Collins]</a>: are we approaching it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=966.595s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What new tools have we developed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=967.796s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What is our sense right now of what we might need to get closer to that goal?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=973.357s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And not some sort of mandate, not some sort of, you know, if it doesn't have this section, then it's invalid or something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=980.399s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A fairly, you know, the phrase I would use, I wouldn't put this in the ordinances, I would be pretty comfortable with this being as formal or as informal as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=991.104s">[Kit Collins]</a>: capacity allows it to be while we're trying to get this annual process off the ground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=994.727s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's important to me is just knowing that we're going to have some kind of document and some kind of check-in in the fall every year that allows us to chart our progress towards the better information and the sophistication that I know the administration is already working towards and that we're eager to support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=1478.796s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was just collecting my thoughts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=1484.5s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I certainly appreciate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=1487.671s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know everything that the chief of staff has shared in this meeting and other and others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=1492.44s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The, I think the point is really well taken and I definitely appreciate the spirit of, you know, just being transparent<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=1499.192s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, I know that these are things that we all want to do, and I really appreciate the clarity around, you know, I know experientially what you want to do and commit to do and what you can do are not always a perfectly overlapping Venn diagram.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=1514.879s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that, you know, as a city, we see how that plays out with our various challenges and episodes and things that we go through in trying to manage our capacity as a city overall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=1524.263s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I just want to note that that point is really well taken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=1530.182s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, this ordinance has changed a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=1531.722s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One thing that, again, and I respect the diversity of opinion about the exact language that this section is put into, one thing that makes me personally feel comfortable is just how flexible the language of this section is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=1544.285s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And of course, I've made it clear before, you know, that in my mind, this says, you know, shall submit a report and doesn't really get prescriptive about what that has to look like beyond touching on certain topics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=1559.432s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It does bring to mind to me because the Chief of Staff mentioned the Elections Department in terms of, you know, I think this conversation is a lot about thinking through contingencies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=1569.318s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What about the years when this report isn't like all that we would dream it to be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=1574.06s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Quite recently, the City Council asked for an elections after action report from the Elections Department and that report was not all that we dreamed it to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=1584.586s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we talked about it and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=1587.915s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that was how we took that document and got some meaning out of it by, you know, that spring conversation about, you know, this is what we would like to see in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=1596.5s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Next time, these are the questions that we still have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=1599.081s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The conversation that we had about the report, I think, answered a little bit more some of those questions that weren't answered in the text of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=1606.565s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I just bring that up as an example of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=1610.001s">[Kit Collins]</a>: um, why I feel comfortable with this language, knowing that, you know, I don't know, like, maybe we'll never have a season of going through this process laid out in the, uh, laid out in the ordinance where it will feel very challenging to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=1624.855s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Maybe it'll feel, feel seamless, you know, starting this fall, maybe it won't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=1629.579s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=1632.375s">[Kit Collins]</a>: if it's not seamless, if there's friction there, if it's challenging to get a report together, if the report, like, has to be very concise, if the report has to be really bare bones the first year, if, you know, we read the report and we still have questions, well, I feel like we already have a model for how that can go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=1646.867s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that even just having a simple document to start out with, that's a jumping off point for a discussion in committee or written follow-up, to me, that's still productive to have, even if<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=1659.298s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that conversation is about what's not included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=1662.78s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I just offer that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=1966.438s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The version of the document that I'm looking at is the track changes one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=1971.957s">[Kit Collins]</a>: appropriate to make a motion to accept the track changes along with those other technical amendments around the effective date and swapping the order of those sections?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=1994.672s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It was the one in the packet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=2030.464s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Section 3154, I think that effective date is corrected by adopting the track changes, but section 3108, motion to switch the effective date to January 1, 2025.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=2046.947s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Shall become effective upon passage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=2396.609s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If this is just a simple finding the right<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=2399.727s">[Kit Collins]</a>: term for the position and swapping it in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=2402.151s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I personally would feel comfortable doing that from the floor, even if we refer this out to regular session tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=2510.881s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would motion to report out of committee as amended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OJMu6n5r-FE&t=2539.746s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'd just like to thank Director Dickinson and the Chief of Staff for meeting with us about this so many times, this term, previous term, and for working through it and coming out with something that we can get a start on and I would motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=719.552s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=720.953s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate the overview since we looked at this last and since this is the first time that we're meeting about this in this current term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=729.417s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's helpful to have the overview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=731.638s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that the comments that we've received from KP Law<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=737.32s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and some other partners have been helpful to get this closer to a finished product.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=746.609s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In terms of starting at the beginning, you know, with the goals of this ordinance, I think it's clear throughout this process, you know, we've kind of tacked our way into a middle path between, you know, the goals of phasing out<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=759.747s">[Kit Collins]</a>: a very polluting technology while making sure that this is something that is manageable from an enforcement standpoint on the city side to make sure that it's a manageable time frame for large properties and commercial users to make sure that we're<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=776.803s">[Kit Collins]</a>: balancing the right regulations and restrictions for commercial users and for private users.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=782.164s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that our process has benefited a lot from hearing from constituents and commercial users in the past and hopefully tonight as well, as well as the Chamber of Commerce and making sure that we've been tailoring and tweaking this so that it's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=796.569s">[Kit Collins]</a>: fair for different use cases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=798.791s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And over the past couple of versions, we've also kind of tweaked that in terms of what specific restrictions we're putting forward and also what metrics and measures we're using.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=813.294s">[Kit Collins]</a>: whether it's the amount of months in the year that we allow use of the gas-powered leaf blowers versus electric, whether it's what we're using to measure if something is within allowable ranges or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=823.917s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm glad to see kind of on that seam of fairness, making sure that this is fair for different types of users.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=829.918s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm glad that we have removed some of the exemptions for municipal use of the leaf blowers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=836.059s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that anything that we're expecting of commercial users, we should expect of municipal contractors as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=840.981s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that's something that I'm happy to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=843.241s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm happy to see that this, I think, is the most readable version of the ordinance that we've had yet, which is, of course, super important because some of the people using this ordinance are just, a lot of them are just homeowners, residents who just want to know, is this okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=856.814s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, is this what my community has in mind for, you know, reality testing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=863.84s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is this a reasonable time to use this tool this time of the year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=867.303s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So looking at the comments put forward by KB Law, I have a couple of motions in mind just to incorporate some of those suggestions, but I'm happy to save those for after comments from my fellow councillors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=881.593s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Or I could just do it right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=883.774s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Why not right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1481.709s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1482.509s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm happy to field, you know, I think that we have, having gone through this ordinance in great detail over past meetings, even though some of the members of the current council are not there for those, I think that we're at a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1498.191s">[Kit Collins]</a>: point in this ordinance where we can think about finalizing it, reporting it out to committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1502.237s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have a couple of motions to make that I think get this to a place where we can report this out to regular session, but I think, you know, because we've spent so much time on this already, we have plenty of space to continue to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1515.819s">[Kit Collins]</a>: focus in on any aspects in this meeting if we need to, to make sure that everybody is feeling comfortable and up to speed before we take next steps on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1524.886s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Towards that, I have a few motions to incorporate some of the suggestions from legal counsel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1532.893s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let me just orient myself here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1534.714s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In section 3858,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1544.773s">[Kit Collins]</a>: First, in subsection five, council noted that it's a bit confusing that this language refers to sweeping or raking because that's the only place in the ordinance that refers to sweeping or raking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1557.223s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Otherwise, we're just referring to blowing leaves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1561.166s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I would motion to delete sweep or rake, which is the suggestion made in the red line copy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1572.842s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And the intent there is just, you know, we've done a lot of work to make this ordinance more readable and very clear in its intent, especially for, you know, there's a wide range of people who are gonna be consulting this, city staff, contractors, residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1586.317s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we, I think, you know, simplicity is always of the essence so that two people reading the same document get the same impression out of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1608.006s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1610.988s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In the same section 3858 subsection 6.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1615.879s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It was noted that, so this says deposits of leaf, dirt, dust, et cetera, shall be removed and disposed of in a sanitary manner, which will prevent it from being dispersed by wind vandalism or similar means.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1630.788s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A little confusing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1632.789s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that rather than trying to define what sanitary matter means, I would,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1645.566s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1646.867s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to delete in a sanitary manner and replace that with in such a manner so that it reused shall be removed and disposed of in such a manner which will prevent it from dot, dot, dot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1657.152s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm happy to pause.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1664.135s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1667.737s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1667.997s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then I have a couple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1673.92s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1674.421s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1679.085s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So my thought here is for the shall be removed in terms of who's accountable for doing the removal shall be removed and dispose of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1687.873s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we could either identify the property owner and the contractor or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1701.072s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well, actually, maybe this is a question to my fellow Councilors for your perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1705.754s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If there's a named party that's responsible for doing the removing, should it be the property owner?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1709.155s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Should it be the person?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1733.396s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1740.058s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well, I think in that section, I think that the phrase owners of large properties is in that section, I think, important, because there are specific regulations for large properties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1759.964s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1764.687s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are we trying to call out the property owner, the landscaper, or both?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1794.451s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that would be, shall be removed and disposed of by the operator in such a manner, which will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1810.965s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then whenever the clerk is ready, I'll keep going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1817.611s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1822.901s">[Kit Collins]</a>: 59 subsection 4, which starts commercial leaf blowers, municipal operators, municipal contractors, and OLP shall submit an operations plan by, I think, September 1.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1835.909s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That provides a good amount of leeway before we really get into peak leaf removal season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1847.356s">[Kit Collins]</a>: September 1.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1855.205s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just for context, that's the operations plan that's submitted by the operator to the building commissioner, a mitigation plan for, you know, we're going to be doing leaf removal with these tools on this property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1871.758s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Here is how we are going to mitigate the noise pollution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1875.18s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Here is how we are going to use the equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1878.543s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Here's how we're going to make sure that the equipment is safely used, is the plan, or is the content to be included in the plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1911.34s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1911.92s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that annually by September one is feels common to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1943.108s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1944.929s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Possibly last from me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1948.589s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Section 3862 subsection 3.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1953.55s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As you noted in your overview, running this by the administration, it's felt that it's not cost effective to set up a special revenue fund for the potential fines collected by this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1967.293s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So my motion will be to delete that section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1971.374s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=1973.156s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that's it for me for now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=2864.088s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's fair to say it's something we've discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=2894.28s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No, I just said that we did actually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=2896.861s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we found that it's still worthwhile to put forward this ordinance that is targeted at specifically two-stroke engines, which are known to be one of the most polluting types.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=4087.68s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=4088.54s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for everybody who's spoken tonight and in previous meetings for and against.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=4093.885s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, I can only speak for myself as one Councilor, this isn't the project that I initiated it was initiated by former President Morell know that all of our projects come out of constituent feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=4105.68s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, from one form or another, this is one of those projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=4110.566s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, I think that this project is really the product of compromise, like a lot of like almost like every single one of our ordinances and resolutions and projects in this chambers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=4121.754s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we've worked hard to get from our starting point, which I think was much more onerous based on, you know, examples that we found in other neighboring cities to try to get this to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=4133.843s">[Kit Collins]</a>: a place that was a better fit for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=4136.765s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've made several I think pretty major adjustments to make sure that the balance of restrictions on commercial operators and residential users was more appropriate to make sure<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=4148.3s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that, you know, anything that was expected of commercial operators would also be expected by municipal contractors and, you know, essentially to say we have a tool here, we have the appetite here to, we're hearing from constituents that we want this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=4164.039s">[Kit Collins]</a>: source of noise pollution to be, you know, to have a lever to pull to make sure that that's at a reasonable level at reasonable times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=4171.106s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we want to take this technology, which is known to be one of the most polluting, you know, I don't think anything, anybody expects us to solve global warming in Medford, but we, I think we've, it came from the community that we have the opportunity to take action on something that is known to be especially polluting and say, let's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=4188.53s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, let's start to rein that in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=4190.912s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And this has been a public process to create a timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=4195.156s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For that we've gotten a lot of feedback on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=4197.999s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Coming out of that we have this draft that we further amended tonight after the feedback from our new building commissioner, city staff, and legal counsel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=4208.669s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I just wanted to thank all the constituents that have weighed in on this over the past, I think, possibly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=4222.974s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's critical for the ordinance project to get, I think that many bites at the apple and that much feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QyOHt10oLs0&t=4228.097s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So with that, I would motion to report this out of committee as amended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=148.87s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I find them in order and I move for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=183.207s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=184.587s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would motion to suspend the rules and take the following papers out of order in this order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=189.765s">[Kit Collins]</a>: 24044, 24040, 24039, 24046, 23411, 23081, and 24043.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=586.817s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=587.477s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for being here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=589.278s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Assessor Costigan, just the basic bullet points for what this new exemption would does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=595.86s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm glad that in the past couple of years, the council has been able to take votes to make sure that we are maxing out the exemptions for these populations in Medford that I think uncontroversially, we want to extend these benefits to populations very deserving of the tax break that the city can provide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=611.944s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'd be happy to motion for approval to adopt this tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=617.401s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That was a motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=666.874s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes, after that one we just voted on, which was 24039, next up is 24046.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=669.8s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2514.128s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2516.149s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you to everybody who's assembled here today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2518.87s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this is probably one of the four council chambers that I've seen, and we pack it two or three times a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2526.583s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you all for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2527.544s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm going to keep it pretty short.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2529.406s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've had several conversations with several folks around this issue in the past few days, some of whom I know were in the room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2538.253s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for reaching out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2539.234s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I always appreciate residents and folks who live and work in this community for getting in touch with us directly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2544.238s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is how this has to work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2546.96s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is the dynamic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2549.093s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're elected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2550.434s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You live here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2550.995s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You work here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2551.636s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2553.077s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm here to listen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2553.778s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've tried to, you know, begin that process of listening with the folks who've reached out to me over the past couple days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2561.566s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've heard about this over the past several days from the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2564.468s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, I am going into this from the perspective of this decision has landed on our desks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2571.355s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that the priority of folks here, the folks who work in service in the interest of public safety, I know what your priority is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2579.281s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Your priority is the public safety of Medford residents, the people who live here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2584.044s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As an elected representative, that has to be my priority as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2586.585s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that's the priority shared by the committee, by the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2589.828s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so as we continue to listen and hear from people around this, that's going to be my guiding light is what decision will be in the best interest of executing public safety for Medford residents,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2601.715s">[Kit Collins]</a>: as well as possible every single day because of how the department is structured and any decisions that we have the jurisdiction to make around that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2608.039s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That is going to be my lens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2609.72s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've said this about other policies before, you know, because it applies to many things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2615.104s">[Kit Collins]</a>: With any decision, what I try to remember, it can't be about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2619.964s">[Kit Collins]</a>: this administration or this person in the role right now or this person who's doing the job right now, it's about the department, it's about the community, it's about today, but it's also about five years from now, 10 years from now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2632.594s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's always hard not to make these issues personal because we are a community made up of people who know each other and care for each other and sometimes have history with one another, but these decisions can't be made with anything other than that North Star of public safety in mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2646.064s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's the perspective that I'm going into this with for the rest of the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2648.626s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I look forward to listening and hearing from people about this continuing to hear from constituents and firefighters and the administration and my fellow Councilors about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2658.752s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2883.476s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2884.397s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I said I wasn't gonna talk again, but I remembered a clarifying question that I just wanted to double check before we get further into the weeds on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2890.782s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's my understanding from the research and the conversations that I've had so far about this, that this change, if it were to go forward, would not render ineligible any applicant within the fire department that's currently eligible for the role that would just extend the pool wider than it currently is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2908.795s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Can the administration confirm if that's true?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8598.375s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8599.236s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I see there are a couple hands still raised on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8601.056s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm happy to defer to those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=8605.238s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think Director Crowley is waiting to speak, and I see a hand that looks new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9949.712s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9951.953s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you to everybody who's spoken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9953.274s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And there's been a lot of members of public service who have spoken tonight and are otherwise here in support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9959.597s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it's never a bad opportunity to say thank you for your service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9963.239s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I didn't say it before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9964.28s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9965.02s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for speaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9966.361s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for sharing your thoughts with us on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9967.902s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And thank you for your service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9970.527s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, we've heard a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9973.348s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm not ready to vote on this tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9974.668s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, we have some, we have some, I think we've all, many of us have put forward a lot of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9984.692s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Some of them to me have not been answered satisfactorily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9987.232s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Some of them have conflicting answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9994.198s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think everybody can agree that this is a serious issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9996.66s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to give it the time that it deserves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=9998.801s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I need more time to consider this and evaluate the proposal on the merits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10002.304s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A lot of people have pointed out that this has been conflated with other allegations against the Fire Department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10006.988s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a serious paper before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10008.449s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'd like the opportunity to continue the conversation in Committee of the Whole with my colleagues and evaluate this proposal on the merits without conflating it with other issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10018.476s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What we're voting on is a change to the civil service position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10020.937s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'd like to have that conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=10023.017s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My motion is to send this to Committee of the Whole, and also to have legal counsel present for that discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13364.531s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13365.652s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13367.073s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As President Bears said, we've had this conversation many times before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13371.536s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this is one of the first things that, I think this was the subject of one of my first committees of the whole in my first term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13377.62s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's been great to get to know this project very well through our various meetings about it as it's gone through its various approval stages with the CPA, the CBB.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13387.126s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's exciting that we're getting to this stage and this very long, very considered process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13394.767s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Obviously, there's a lot to talk about here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13396.889s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's been a lot of detail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13397.97s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's baked into the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13400.853s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But for me, still the most compelling thing is preserving those 144 existing deeply affordable units, adding 94 deeply affordable units to our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13412.543s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think I said this the last time we talked about this, but it is so incredibly rare that we get the chance to make a double digit percentage increase towards our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13420.831s">[Kit Collins]</a>: known affordable housing goals in the city, especially when we're leveraging funding that comes from outside of our community, our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13426.953s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's, it's such a rare opportunity I know it's a value that shared behind this rail throughout so much of the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13433.876s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it's so important not only to be increasing affordable housing in the community but really<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13438.537s">[Kit Collins]</a>: excellent, dignified, affordable housing for people at all stages of life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13443.72s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is an area where I think Medford is really leading, and thank you so much to your leadership on this and making sure that this project is shepherded through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13449.623s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't have a lot of questions because I've had the opportunity to ask you tons of nitty gritty questions before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13457.768s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We haven't opened the public hearing yet, so I'll save my motion for later, but thank you so much for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=13462.791s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15951.22s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15952.36s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would motion to, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15955.762s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Adopt the condition to approve and adopt the conditions recommended by the Community Development Board and adopt the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=15963.305s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16388.186s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16389.966s">[Kit Collins]</a>: At the most recent planning and permitting committee meeting, which is the second meeting of that committee, in keeping with the theme of preliminary meetings, we picked up a two-year-old paper to explore a home rule petition around rent stabilization and just cause eviction protections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16406.611s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This will be the first of many conversations that we'll have on the paper with the end result being a home rule position, not an ordinance that the city council would or could pass outright.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16416.274s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So more to come on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16417.454s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16482.029s">[Kit Collins]</a>: She says yes in the chat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16534.223s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16536.843s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The idea for this ordinance came out of conversations that I had with several members of city staff and several residents over the course of last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16547.56s">[Kit Collins]</a>: residents were complaining about specific sidewalks and residential neighborhoods that were rendered impassable by vegetation starting on private properties that have grown so long that folks couldn't walk on the sidewalk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16559.17s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've talked about this with code enforcement, and it seems like there may be a gap in our municipal code that prevents them from having the statute that they need to do enforcement when<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16569.258s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the public way is impacted by plant growth, essentially, from private properties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16574.28s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this would just be a really targeted project to make sure that there's enabling language in our code of ordinances so that code enforcement does have the ability to issue warnings and potentially tickets if need be when folks cannot travel on the public way because of stuff coming out of private property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16591.669s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I would move the question to proceed this along to the Public Health and Community Safety Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16733.629s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we're talking about the housing stability notification ordinance right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16752.421s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is an ordinance that we passed one year ago, actually just almost exactly a year ago, the Housing Stability Notification Ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16775.862s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16776.562s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So it's been almost exactly a year since this council passed the housing stability notification ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16783.264s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a pretty specific pretty limited ordinance that says when a property owner has a tenant in a building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16793.948s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The city shall develop a document that outlines just very, very basic tenants rights and resources, and the property owner renting to attendants to send that document to their tenant at the beginning or end of every lease.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16806.799s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's not a document that the landlord has to create it's something that they can download off of the city website and make sure that it's conveyed to their tenant this is opposed to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16815.146s">[Kit Collins]</a>: kind of empower people with information, and hopefully answer some questions before questions come up in the landlord tenant relationship.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16823.671s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Like I said this was passed about a year ago there's been some turnover in the planning development sustainability office this is the first time we tried to do something like this in Medford so the point of this resolution is to hold a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16834.958s">[Kit Collins]</a>: with Planning, Development and Sustainability staff and some others been working on this in the Office of Outreach and Prevention to check in on how gearing up for implementation and enforcement of this ordinance is going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16846.406s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There are several questions to discuss, including where are we at in terms of developing that document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16852.21s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that staff has been running it by legal and trying to get it to a place of completion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16857.273s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Then there's the matter of how to make sure that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16860.495s">[Kit Collins]</a>: property owners are properly informed about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16862.697s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Of course, we have to make sure that we're conveying this in the communication channels to make sure that people really going to hear about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16870.903s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is not intended to be punitive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16872.524s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is intended to be informational.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16874.285s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know that city staff was looking at very many communications, communication channels to make sure that the folks who need to know about this do know about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16881.771s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So the point of this meeting is to meet with city staff and say, how's it going?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16885.814s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Where are we at in the process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16887.355s">[Kit Collins]</a>: How can we help?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=16889.554s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I would move to refer this conversation to the Committee on Planning and Permitting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17355.953s">[Kit Collins]</a>: City clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17357.555s">[Kit Collins]</a>: 24045 offered by as various council president resolution regarding scheduled annual budget process for FY 2025.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17362.359s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the council president request City<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17377.971s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Be it further resolved that, based on the schedule included in the soon-to-be finalized budget ordinance, the City Council and City Administration will follow the budget schedule for the FY 2025 City Budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17389.015s">[Kit Collins]</a>: By March 1, 2024, City Councilors submit individual budget recommendations for consideration by Administration and Finance Committee,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17397.995s">[Kit Collins]</a>: By Friday, March 22nd, 2024, City Council submits collective budget recommended to the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17405.464s">[Kit Collins]</a>: From April 15th, 2024 to May 15th, 2024, City Council holds preliminary budget meetings with department heads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17413.553s">[Kit Collins]</a>: By Friday, May 31st, 2024, mayor submits comprehensive budget proposal to the City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17419.684s">[Kit Collins]</a>: president bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17797.365s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are there any other comments from my fellow councillors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17800.426s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any members of the public that would like to speak on this paper?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17829.79s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17831.991s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Seeing no further comment on the motion of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17835.486s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears as amended by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17875.3s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Six in favor, one absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=17975.828s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Not confirmed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2077.793s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2078.893s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Teresa, Roberta, for your presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2083.177s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I always look forward to these meetings once or twice a year because the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2088.388s">[Kit Collins]</a>: always does such a great job of putting together, you know, not just gassing up but it's always a really great set of projects that I think, you know, we can be really proud to fund and, you know, looking at this list of the award summary for fiscal year 24 these projects are spread out all across the community like you said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2103.428s">[Kit Collins]</a>: there's a pretty good mix between those three eligibility categories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2108.072s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's always really great to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2109.494s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's exciting to have a mix of projects that are in their inception and those study phases and then ones where we can see that we've been investing in these projects over years and pushing them forward to completion and being even better resources for the city to enjoy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2122.305s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's just, you know, it's nice when you tee us up like that, we just get to vote on good stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2128.03s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's always great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2129.031s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think it's, it's always good to have the conversation about when we're talking about investing in capital projects, investing in open space, investing in affordable housing, you know, to have that conversation about what role does the CPA funding in that because it's like you said, that's, you know, that's a that that scope can be, you know, as big as we're willing to open our eyes to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2151.373s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it's good to have the conversation about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2154.56s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What role can this play?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2156.162s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Where can we put this money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2157.743s">[Kit Collins]</a>: How far does that get us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2159.345s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And to continue to have that conversation about contextualizing, what else would we do if the limit was higher?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2166.232s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you for this great set of awardees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2170.356s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for the context.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2173.48s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Much appreciation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=2406.964s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would motion to report out favorably.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=1054.062s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Chair Tsai.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=1057.23s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As for the elections commission, I think that I would just really love for the conversation that we had the last time the election commission came before us in a regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=1070.234s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think the most helpful instructions that I would like forwarded to the elections commission would just be the meeting notes from that part of our discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=1077.576s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In my estimation, I think the council was pretty unified in just wanting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=1086.081s">[Kit Collins]</a>: a more explicit and a more specific response to the questions that we laid out in the original paper requesting the election after report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=1096.944s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so that's, as one Councilor, that's what I'll be looking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=1099.625s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's what I'm hoping for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=1100.486s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that that was pretty well articulated by many Councilors who spoke in our last conversation about it with the Elections Commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/oURuPje1TU0&t=1107.848s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=165.114s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=167.737s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I thank the Councilor for chairing this meeting because I have to be remote tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=173.264s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=176.207s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this is the first time that we are talking about this paper in committee, even though it was introduced in 2022.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=181.734s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I wanted to begin<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=184.457s">[Kit Collins]</a>: with a brief overview of the paper, what it is, what it isn't, why it was brought up, when it was, and just to kind of place us at the beginning of a discussion about this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=197.62s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Like I mentioned, this was brought forward by myself and President Bears in 2022.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=203.061s">[Kit Collins]</a>: At the time, this was a resolution that bundled together many ideas for housing stability-related home rule petitions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=212.904s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It included, these ideas included rent stabilization, tenant right to purchase, tenant right to counsel, just cause eviction protections, anti-price gouging protections, exemptions for small owner-occupant landlords.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=226.128s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This was a resolution that bundled together kind of a roster of different ideas that have been used by various local municipalities all around the goal of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=237.071s">[Kit Collins]</a>: trying to introduce some stability into a housing market that is governed by market forces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=241.453s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I also want to speak a little bit to the particular moment during which this paper arose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=248.176s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This was, I believe, March of 2022.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=251.898s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We had just had an issue right here in Medford Square, where a large apartment building on Bradley Road, all of the tenants had been served notices to quit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=261.743s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The story given was renovations to the apartments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=265.945s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But in effect, what we saw play out at the site was that a recent change of hands for the property and the property owners wanted to be able to rent those units at very much higher rates than they had been rented to for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=282.708s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we saw a lot of tenants leave the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=286.109s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We saw a lot of tenants kind of have to react to this with not a lot of information, not a lot of options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=295.291s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and come to the City Council for help and say, what can we do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=298.433s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And unfortunately, we had to say, you know, there's not a lot that we can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=302.335s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, we cannot intervene in this kind of situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=305.156s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We can't get between, we can't get in the middle of this transaction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=309.398s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We can provide you with folks who are experts in this type of situation, but there's nothing that the City Council can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=317.142s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to help you stay in your home, stay in your community, keep your commute the same, keep your kid in public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=322.045s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So these ideas came out of that conversation with those tenants, I believe almost all of whom eventually ended up getting displaced out of the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=333.892s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And in that time, of course, we've seen other unfortunate examples of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=340.919s">[Kit Collins]</a>: rent increases so exorbitant that they had the same effect of displacing tenants out of the community when they otherwise would have remained community members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=350.567s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I just wanted to give that framing for why that came up when it did because it's been a little while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=463.307s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Chair Leming, if I may.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=468.749s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=469.49s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And thank you, Councilor Scarpelli, for raising that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=472.351s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=473.152s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that rent stabilization is absolutely an issue that gets people's hackles up, you know, wherever they feel about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=478.656s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I completely appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=481.057s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do want to, you know, and I think that Councilor Scarpelli, we're coming at this meeting actually in a similar frame of mind, you know, as you and I know through going through this process on various resolutions and ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=492.325s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is the beginning of a process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=494.186s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's probably going to be a fairly lengthy and thorough process because this is such a delicate issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=500.691s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let me return to sort of the framing of the issue, because I hope that I can speak to some of the concerns that you brought up, and I think that they're important ones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=511.362s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For those folks who don't know, a home rule petition is when any city says to the state,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=519.298s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, state, here's a thing that ordinarily cities can't do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=522.219s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'd like for you to make an exception.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=523.92s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think that one way we can think about this process is that we're beginning the process of collaboratively drafting a piece of legislation that we would like the permission to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=536.626s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know I heard from some folks this afternoon who said, please do not pass this bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=540.888s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're not passing a bill tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=542.249s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is conversation number one of many about a topic that's going to take a lot of time to talk about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=547.594s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is just the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=550.456s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, there were meeting documents circulated before the meeting, which is common practice for us to circulate common drafts for Councilors to read before the meeting starts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=560.665s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My intent, and I'll make these motions later in the meeting, is for us to open up a conversation in this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=566.11s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Afterwards, we'll circulate the documents to relevant city staff, stakeholders, and then we'll use them as a jumping off point for our next conversation on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=577.134s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just to follow up on the point I was making about the Home Rule petition,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=581.98s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In the hypothetical scenario that we finish a home brawl petition about rent stabilization and just cause eviction, which is kind of the jumping off point that I created for a conversation tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=592.569s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If that were to go through, if this council were to approve it, then it would go to our state delegation and the jurisdiction would be with them to approve or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=601.436s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that is just the standard procedure for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=604.258s">[Kit Collins]</a>: for any Home Rule petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=605.279s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I just wanted to make that clear, because I know these things are often opaque outside of City Hall in terms of the process that we're looking at here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=617.688s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Pause there in case there are any questions from fellow Councilors on the process, or if not, I can just quickly run through more of the table setting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=728.502s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Chair Leming, and thank you, Councilor Sparkely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=730.903s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate, and of course, I think it's obviously a goal that we share that everybody who'd like to weigh in has the opportunity to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=737.766s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's not my, as one councilor, it's not my intent that we're going to take any substantive action or vote to take actions on this draft tonight, but rather that this can be a draft that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=750.173s">[Kit Collins]</a>: constituents, councilors, stakeholders, and city staff can continue to review starting tonight and in the run-up to our next meeting on the topic, giving everybody ample time to review it, and then we'll revisit the same draft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=762.141s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I hope that that'll provide a lot of opportunity for people to read it and digest it before we revisit it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=770.717s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Having said that, and of course, happy to circle back to the process at any point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=775.842s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just, I think that I'm sure that there are other people in the room and on the Zoom tonight who can speak to the potential uses of rent stabilization and how it's been used in Massachusetts before later in the meeting, but just to quickly kind of frame the conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=796.409s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Like I mentioned, rent stabilization, I think most people know what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=800.01s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's a way for a government entity, usually a city, to set a cap by which rent costs may not increase above that amount in a given year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=813.872s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then it sets forth the exceptions to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=817.493s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let me find the... Trying to find a handy quote that I found in my research about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=826.624s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, this is from, and pulling together some resources as I was preparing just myself for this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=834.188s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is one of the strategies that the Metropolitan Area Planning Commission touches on on its website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=842.171s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that they have a pretty handy encapsulation of what rent control does and doesn't do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=846.153s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They say rent control denies unlimited excessive rent increases, thus limiting profits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=852.276s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Rent control does, however, allow for annual increases that provide owners a fair return on investment with sufficient income to maintain property in a satisfactory manner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=862.858s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They go on to say rent control laws usually include provisions that protect a landlord's investment in these ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=869.58s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For example, sometimes defining fair return, a hardship appeals process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=875.561s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So there are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=877.363s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There are many levers and exemptions and ways to tailor these policies that I think we can look to other cities, including cities in Massachusetts, to guide our discussion as we start looking at drafts, as we get beyond the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=893.343s">[Kit Collins]</a>: preliminary table setting stage and into crafting a home rule petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=898.586s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that there's a lot of ways that cities have worked really hard to tailor this to their communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=903.969s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that that if this project goes forward, we'll be looking to do here in Medford is to say, what does this community need?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=910.633s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And how can we tailor this to Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=916.894s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Like I said, the idea for this in Medford came out of a particularly visible displacement event.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=928.061s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that displacement in general in Medford continues to, we continue to see that happening in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=934.284s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know for myself, I'm sure for some of my other Councilors, this is something that we hear about, unfortunately, from time to time, housing scarcity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1149.069s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Callahan, for the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1150.71s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I circulated around noon today through the city clerk some example language from the city of Somerville, a draft jumping off point document for our discussion for a potential home rule petition here in Medford, and a link to some background info from the MAPC.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1173.089s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So you're correct, the original resolution included those ideas for seven home rule petitions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1178.891s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I thought that, you know, seven is a lot to do in one meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1182.033s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm not sure if it's the will of the council to advance with all of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1186.335s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I thought that this meeting, we could begin a conversation about rent stabilization in other communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1191.177s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They've bundled rent stabilization and just cause eviction together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1194.619s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that's what the document circulated by the clerk does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1332.95s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Chair Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1333.79s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1334.671s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And yes, I think it would be great to start hearing from some of the other city staff and advocates that I know are in the room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1345.814s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just quickly, I want to say, you know, I think in my experience, it's, you know, I, sorry, two thoughts happening in my head at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1364.02s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just want to really emphasize that for the purposes of this conversation, we are beginning a discussion about something that has been brought up by the City Council two years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1374.827s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The intent to pursue this at some point has been public record for some time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1382.131s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The content of this resolution has been public record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1384.654s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I hear that people would like more time to look at the documents that have been circulated in support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1391.602s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is true that we very often get supporting documents for meetings pretty close to the meeting time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1396.388s">[Kit Collins]</a>: At least that's been my experience for the past term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1401.053s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I completely respect that people want more time to look through a draft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1405.897s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's why I was hoping that the purpose of this meeting could be to begin the conversation and then give people the intervening two or four weeks to read it and develop feedback and bring that to our next committee meeting on this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1416.426s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think that we're all aligned on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1419.068s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Before we turn it over to other speakers and people who have comments that they'd like to contribute to this discussion, I just want to again really emphasize that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1428.908s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's true that rent stabilization is talked about as if it's one thing, and it has one set of consequences, and those are always the same, and they're always bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1438.755s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But that's really not true, and I think that we have the capacity and the creativity in this community to say, we have this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1448.441s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We know that there are people<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1450.302s">[Kit Collins]</a>: who want to move out of their parents' homes and get their own apartment in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1453.885s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We know that there are people who want to have their own place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1456.647s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We know that there are couples that want to move in together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1458.869s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We know that there are people who can't afford to buy a home, but love it here and want to stay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1464.093s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we know that rent costs are a huge problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1467.415s">[Kit Collins]</a>: for all of those types of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1471.278s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that knowing this council, this is a proactive council, every member, I think that it is well worth our time to say, before we dismiss this, let's take a good long look at rent stabilization, something that other communities have looked at, and see if there's a way to tailor this to Medford so that we could keep more Medford residents in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1491.991s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I also want to note, again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1493.772s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And people will see this when they take more time with the examples from other communities and with the draft home repetition for Medford that are created as a jumping off point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1501.737s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But there are myriad exemptions that we can build in to make sure that this is not anything that is going to be dramatic or drastic for people who do own rental units in Medford, exemptions for smaller types of properties, exemptions for certain types of owners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1517.505s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's all on the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1518.786s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I hope that we can proceed with cool heads because I think that everybody's going to have something productive to continue to contribute to this conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=1526.733s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll leave it there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2862.142s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Chair Levening, and thank you to all of the constituents, advocates, city staff that has spoken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2869.325s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Really appreciate getting some preliminary voices into the discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2874.227s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that this is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2879.417s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What our conversation just in the past 15 minutes has, I think, reinforced for me is that this is a topic and a term that is so heavily connotated that using these meetings to bring that nuance into the conversation and just to really recenter on what exactly is being proposed and how it differs from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2898.208s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the idea that we have in our heads about what rent control is or must be, I think that that'll be where we get a lot of really productive work done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2905.592s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate raising some of the details around what we mean when we say just cause eviction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2910.634s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I hope that as we continue to enter into the details of this process, whether we're talking about just cause eviction or whether we're talking about really finessing the styles and levers around the specific numbers and exemptions and conditions around rent stabilization,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2928.003s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I hope that we can, I think that we'll have a really quick conversation around the nuance and how to, again, make this something that is more helpful than not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2938.429s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that grounding this in the overall context of how big of a problem displacement is in Medford and how increasing housing supply is deeply crucial and the council is very enmeshed in that work and it can never be fast enough to deal with the displacement that we have been seeing for years and continue to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2960.064s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think we just have to challenge ourselves to do more than one thing at a time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2964.106s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I really appreciate everybody being a part of this conversation from the outset and trying to help us do that as well as we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2971.752s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would like to make a motion to recirculate the background information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=2981.824s">[Kit Collins]</a>: sample Home Rule Petition from Somerville and first draft of our Home Rule Petition from Medford that was circulated earlier today to all councillors, the Director of the Planning Development and Sustainability Office, to the Senior Planner, Housing Staff Planner,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=3000.106s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Of course, these will be available on the city website under the report for this committee meeting and to request feedback and comments by February 28th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=3011.094s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And Mr. Clerk, I'd be happy to email that language over to you so you have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=3014.897s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's just a motion to recirculate all of the meeting documents to Councilors and staff and request feedback by the 28th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=3059.67s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I am interested in, I think my next priority would be TOPA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=3066.973s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=3067.434s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I believe that that is included in the governing agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=3070.195s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't know that the others are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=3135.34s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have no objection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=3177.873s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Chair Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=3182.834s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Even though we're splitting off this project, I would still motion to keep the paper in committee because we haven't met on TOPA yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3l8qmINEpLQ&t=3192.297s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I would motion to keep the paper in committee and motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1455.509s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1455.989s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate that and I just wanted to jump in ahead of any other city staff who are going to speak and just say you know I really appreciate that overview and I think it's, it's certainly abundantly clear to me as one Councilor all the time and I feel pretty safe and speaking for my fellow Councilors that the health department, the Office of Prevention and Outreach, everybody involved in this type of preventative<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1481.677s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and supportive work in City Hall, just always doing such an incredible job with the resources that they have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1487.783s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm kind of always in awe of it, and I really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1490.186s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's always a good time to get an overview of what is currently on offer, so I just really appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1496.032s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And Pastor Jerry as well, it's incredible to hear about the work that you and your congregation have done for years in Malden, and I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1504.878s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know the theme that's come up and kind of the testimony that we've heard so far that I suspect we'll hear over and over again for as long as we talk about this topic and future meetings is that, you know, just like we say that the housing crisis is a regional issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1517.307s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So, so too is the homelessness issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1520.649s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so I think it's really<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1523.683s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that really is at the heart of it to think about and how this plays out across a blurry line, across our various municipal boundaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1531.747s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But at the end of the day, we have to think about regional capacity and how we're contributing to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1536.549s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1537.409s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Looking forward to hearing more perspectives on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3596.024s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, sorry, my headset was still muted, even though my computer was not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3601.866s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Chair Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3603.807s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I second everything that you said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3605.207s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I echo everything you said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3606.088s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much to all of our members of city staff for being here for tonight and for really grounding the beginning of this conversation in your years of experience and expertise in helping us frame this conversation that prioritizes<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3624.955s">[Kit Collins]</a>: contributing material benefit to these neighbors and framing this conversation in dignity for everybody that this serves to touch dignity and safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3636.458s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm sure this will be the first of, I hope, many meetings and conversations about this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3641.859s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It sounded like we were trying to wrap this up for now because it's getting late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3646.12s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I would put forward a motion to keep this paper in committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3652.303s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know Chair Lazari did note I do have a paper that I'd love to take off the table if we have time for tonight, but I know that we have another action item to review the governing agenda, so I would be happy for us to proceed to that first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3691.383s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for the question, Chair Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3693.224s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If we are going to continue and try to get through the second<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3697.971s">[Kit Collins]</a>: action discussion item for this meeting during this meeting, which is going over the governing agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3702.532s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The ordinance that I was hoping to take off the table is included in the governing agenda because it was assigned a paper number last term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3709.914s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I might see if my fellow Councilors would entertain a motion on it if we get to it during that section of the agenda, instead of taking it off the table as a separate paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3723.277s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm seeing confused looks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3725.759s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I feel confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3728.562s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, so, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3852.086s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Chair Lazzaro, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3853.807s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I defer to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3855.868s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I am pulling up the draft governing agenda right now just to look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3893.731s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3895.192s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, just to offer suggestion, which, you know, um, as chair, I completely leave it up to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3900.497s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What do you like to do with the remainder of our meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3902.299s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And if we, if we'd like to set a goal end time, I think that would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3907.112s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, fine as well, but I know a number of the projects that are in the governing agenda under public health and community safety committee, and I'd be happy to share my screen if that's helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3917.919s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, a number of these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3921.621s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are new as of this term on a number of them were proposed in the previous term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3927.244s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So, depending on how we want to spend the remainder of our time, I'd be happy to, um, assist with kind of quickly running through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3935.95s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that list of projects to provide a general overview and perhaps the timelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3982.749s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have it up, Chair Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3989.753s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No, I think we're all co-hosts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4005.276s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, is my screen viewable?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4013.24s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm happy to talk through any of these projects, if that would be helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4017.762s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One's from the previous term, myself or Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4020.904s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But Councilor Lazzaro, I'll wait for your direction on which would be helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4024.626s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't want to grab the steering wheel more than I already have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4144.884s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I'd be happy to speak to as I've probably spent, second only to President Bears, I've probably spent the most time staring at this document of the Councilors assembled in assisting compiling ideas from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4166.9s">[Kit Collins]</a>: from all of from all of the Councilors, you and I included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4169.781s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm happy to speak to this is one that I submitted and just quickly run through some of the others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4176.985s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Eternity emergency response slash civilian oversight, being a topic that has been brought up to myself as one Councilor by constituents many times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4189.591s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Kind of I know that we're kind of broadly having a conversation about where these projects will occur.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4195.197s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Over the course of the two years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4197.28s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this one we have a goal date of starting not immediately perhaps beginning this conversation in July.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4208.871s">[Kit Collins]</a>: perhaps with the conversation that we were just having, the hypothetical proposed warming center, ideally a regional collaboration, something that we're starting to do in Medford, and also I think dovetails with the resiliency hub work that several of our city staff were just talking about when we were talking about this need to kind of plug some of our social service needs here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4234.748s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm interested to see how this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4238.573s">[Kit Collins]</a>: this item on the governing agenda evolves as our conversation about the warming center evolves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4248.115s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm happy to speak to any of the ordinances briefly, if helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4312.073s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4312.453s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, the overgrowth ordinance was born out of conversations I've had with constituents and staff about the need to empower city staff to do enforcement around essentially when vegetation on private property is grown so long that it is obstructing the public way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4331.05s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For example, a hedge or, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4334.269s">[Kit Collins]</a>: plants in somebody's yard that are so overgrown that they're spilling into the sidewalk and people can't walk in the sidewalk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4339.691s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They have to cross the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4341.572s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They have to push their stroller in the street, et cetera, just to give city staff the ability to enforce around that because currently they don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4347.914s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that should be fairly straightforward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4350.616s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's the idea there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4352.696s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Similarly, paper 23449 is, again, about giving city staff the authority to do enforcement around<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4362.566s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, not around activities when they become problematic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4366.27s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Similar to the overgrowth ordinance, it's not about policing everybody for your plants must be about a certain height.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4371.475s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's if something is happening to such an extent that it's becoming a problem, we should be able to do something about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4376.841s">[Kit Collins]</a>: With the wildlife feeding ordinance, this is a measure that would empower city officials to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4384.708s">[Kit Collins]</a>: issue warnings or tickets if persistent wildlife feeding is really creating nuisances or health hazards on private property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4393.892s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So after we run through the governing agenda I might put forward a motion to authorize myself as ordinance sponsor to circulate a draft ordinance to the members of this committee and city staff for comment ahead of this next committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4409.139s">[Kit Collins]</a>: After that regulating the retail<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4413.075s">[Kit Collins]</a>: reading facilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4414.716s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There is no draft for this yet, this has come out of another, this has also come out of constituent request for this regulation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4561.412s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4564.013s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A ordinance that we passed in 2023, the community control over surveillance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4569.852s">[Kit Collins]</a>: over public surveillance ordinance requires the annual submission of reports from the city agencies that employ surveillance technology about those uses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4581.062s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this is just an annual procedure of meeting with the agency that submit those reports and discussing them, fielding questions from Councilors in the public, is something that, per the language of the ordinance, belongs with this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4597.815s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So as the chair is aware, we have already scheduled the first meeting to go over an annual surveillance report for this committee's April meeting, which I am myself very much looking forward to, to go over Medford Police Department's annual surveillance report, which should only include the use of body-worn cameras for the part of the year leading up to March 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4621.102s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that process will be ongoing on an annual basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4627.556s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is another sort of maintenance project that has to do with an ordinance passed in the previous term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4633.96s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As far as my understanding goes, the implementation process for the Housing Stability Notification Ordinance, which was also passed in 2023, I believe is still being worked on by partners in the Planning Department, the Board of Health, the Office of Outreach and Prevention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4650.411s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Getting the word out about this ordinance was, you know, no small feat to tenants and landlords alike.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4656.235s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this project would be to follow up with those partners in how broadcasting the news of this ordinance is going, how upkeep, how uptake is going, and how we can enforce that this ordinance is known about and being followed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4675.282s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so this has a goal start date of April.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4677.983s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know our April meeting date, as we just said, is already pretty full.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4681.925s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So maybe the chair and I can work on scheduling an appropriate date to schedule a meeting to begin to take up this project as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4846.257s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes, it's my understanding and again, this, of course, the, uh, the parameters of this project would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4856.488s">[Kit Collins]</a>: put forward by the Councilor that's leading on it, and it's currently listed as no Councilor owning this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4862.332s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's just put forward as a good idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4864.394s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I don't want to speak for whoever leads on this project and their priorities, but it's my understanding that rather than fitting, rather than creating a maintenance plan for emergency equipment based on a particular year's operating schedule, this is more about reconciling our emergency fleet<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4884.8s">[Kit Collins]</a>: with our capital spending plan, which is a multi-year document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4889.062s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think that this wouldn't need to wait for the submission of any annual operating budget, but rather be something that we do in parallel with our long-term budget planning collaboration with the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4903.666s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just for clarity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4929.248s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4929.948s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4930.769s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for making space for that project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4932.93s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think at this point, the clerk has helpfully reminded me that I don't need to officially motion to circulate a draft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4940.112s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So if it is all right with the chair, I would love for and I can communicate about this with you offline as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4946.695s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would love for that paper to be listed as an action item for our next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4950.596s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And in the meantime, I will circulate a draft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4952.917s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Of the ordinance to the members of this committee and to city staff for their feedback so we can have a more substantive conversation next time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4978.633s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4979.374s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A good question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4980.115s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That will be the first time that we review the draft in this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4985.781s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any work and amendments and revisions that we make to the ordinance will be done in this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4989.925s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then when this committee feels that it's ready to be put before the full council, we'll vote it out to a regular session for presumably a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=5012.561s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would motion to receive and place on file 24006, which is the paper to review the governing agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=88.37s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=90.672s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In February, we celebrate Black History Month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=92.613s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The story of Medford is a story of black achievement and black community, from abolitionist organizing, to local icons like Belinda Sutton, to the historic black community of West Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=102.802s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This Black History Month, we celebrate black history in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=105.184s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We endeavor to hold black history and celebrate it every month of the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=108.987s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I hope that we can recommit ourselves to policies that will allow Medford to remain a diverse community for people of all backgrounds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=700.899s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=701.98s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The Planning and Permitting Committee had its first standing meeting to go over the projects that have so far been assigned to that committee over the coming term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=710.831s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and some papers in committee that have also been allocated to be worked on in that committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=716.175s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we'll continue to create a draft schedule for working through those ordinances oriented around the zoning project, which will organize much of our work for this term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=765.096s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would motion to suspend the rolls and take out of order the scheduled public participation appearing at the end of the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=771.358s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Then paper 24037, paper 24038, the elections papers, followed by 24021, and finally 24035.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2627.961s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2629.622s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate my fellow Councilors for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2631.723s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I certainly will be comfortable supporting the resolution tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2633.945s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's also fine to discuss it more with relevant stakeholders and community members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2639.008s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For me, putting aside the medical and therapeutic uses associated with psychedelic plants, it's certainly not my belief that drug-related arrests and prosecutions should be a law enforcement priority, except when it comes to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2650.535s">[Kit Collins]</a>: some of the things specifically exempted in the resolution, such as unauthorized commercial sale, distribution of minors, driving under the influence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2659.978s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Recent history, I mean, not so recent history has shown us that criminalization of substances does not meaningfully advance public health and public safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2667.56s">[Kit Collins]</a>: At the same time, this is a holistic issue, so I look forward to future discussion about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2671.482s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3605.913s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3607.875s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've put forward an amended version of the resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3610.017s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would motion to amend the resolution and adopt the revised language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3613.78s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A copy is in front of, sorry, a copy of the amended resolution is in front of all councilors and in the hands of the clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3619.785s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would motion to amend the resolution and adopt the new language and have it read into the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3974.002s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3974.863s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for reading all of that into the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3978.929s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to briefly speak to why I'm putting forth an amended resolution from what was submitted to be incorporated in the Council's formal agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3986.771s">[Kit Collins]</a>: After I put forward the resolution last week, I was contacted by many constituents who urged me to reconsider the language before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4003.382s">[Kit Collins]</a>: With an issue such as this, it is critical to speak with as much clarity and precision as possible, even when and especially when it's uncomfortable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4012.568s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was called upon to amend this resolution to more authentically and faithfully represent the harms endured on both sides of the Israel and Palestinian border.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4021.173s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In addition, while the ultimate ask of this resolution is for an immediate and enduring bilateral ceasefire, I was also called upon to not let the historical context go unsaid and unacknowledged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4031.539s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I thank everybody who got in touch with me from the original request to put forward a ceasefire resolution to the many people who gave me feedback and worked with me to improve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4051.323s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Despite my note about updating the language of this resolution, I also want to put forth a disclaimer that I don't believe I personally have the ability or maybe it's simply not possible to talk about this issue in a way that does not leave one group or another at risk of feeling diminished or blamed or impoverished.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4075.506s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If you are feeling that way, please blame me or blame the insufficiency of language to talk about an issue that is breaking all of our hearts and has been breaking all of our hearts for decades, and most especially many people in this room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4086.413s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4088.559s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to speak briefly to why I elected to bring this resolution forward, apart from the fact that I was contacted by constituents to do so, that being the ultimate reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4100.527s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I am Jewish.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4101.648s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My ancestors on both sides came to America in the early 1900s because Eastern Europe wasn't safe for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4107.772s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My last name is Collins because my great-grandfather couldn't get a job with a Jewish last name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4112.956s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My family knows that anti-Semitism is real and it is dangerous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4118.976s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I believe that past hardship and trauma and persecution are never valid nor meaningful, but we can seek to make past trauma and hardship, we can seek to get something out of that if we put that experience in service of other people and stand in solidarity with other people who are also facing oppression and persecution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4141.232s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Now we see a right-wing government using the grief of Jewish people, like me, and the name of Jewish people to justify the destruction of an entire civilian population in Gaza.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4150.798s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There are no words that can adequately capture this horror, pain, and injustice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4155.141s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This resolution is long, but the ask is simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4158.023s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Our US government is deeply entwined with and invested in the Israeli military.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4162.006s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Our federal leaders have the influence, the power, and the purse strings to hasten an end to the killing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4168.75s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This issue is painful and divisive, more for some than for others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4173.974s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But ultimately, this resolution is about safety, and I believe that should unify us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4179.117s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Marginalizing Palestinians, whether legally, physically, or in the media, advances no one's safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4185.701s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's simply not right, and I would defy anyone to tell me that the mass murder, displacement, and destruction in Gaza will leave Israeli residents more safe from violent extremism.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4197.17s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Some people would question the validity of city-level resolutions about this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4201.295s">[Kit Collins]</a>: To me, this is a Medford issue because Medford residents are invested in the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4206.262s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And while the U.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4207.323s">[Kit Collins]</a>: government condones the killing and sends unrestricted military aid to Israel, communities right here in the U.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4212.971s">[Kit Collins]</a>: are starved for funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4214.933s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If you attend any average city council meeting, what you'll hear us talk about ultimately is how there aren't enough public dollars to pay for resident services, fully funded schools, affordable housing, road safety, and on and on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4227.556s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Meanwhile, our federal leaders authorized billions to help bomb kids in Gaza.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4233.198s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I find that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4243.174s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I find it unfathomable on a human level, and I find it infuriating as a Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4248.686s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Those dollars should be promoting wellness at home, not destruction abroad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4253.419s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I hope that we can find unity in the unacceptability of this oppression and this loss of life, and in demanding an immediate and lasting de-escalation and ceasefire in Gaza.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4263.565s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I hope that we as a council can join the groundswell of city councils, amplifying their residents' calls for ceasefire, and add Medford's voice to the chorus for peace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4272.99s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I hope we can find unity in diminishing no one's suffering and trauma, and in demanding safety and peace for all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10833.689s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10835.56s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you to everybody who spoke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10837.961s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I already made the motion to adopt the new language and move forward with that new language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10844.485s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to adopt, yeah, that's what I said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10846.606s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'll now motion to amend and adopt the new language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10853.09s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10854.111s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I hear everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10856.272s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I hear all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10860.555s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't know if it's possible for everybody to be heard equally, but I hear you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10865.379s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I motion for approval of the resolution as amended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13149.759s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13150.82s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate Councilor Lazzaro for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13153.482s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm really excited to start a discussion of what we can do to pilot a warming and cooling center of our own here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13160.026s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As Councilor Lazzaro stated, we've known for a long time now that it's not sustainable to keep directing our unhoused neighbors to the resources in other communities to stay safe and warm at night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13170.652s">[Kit Collins]</a>: communities and other resources are already overburdened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13173.893s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We need to start sometime at figuring out a path towards strengthening our own safety net and supportive services here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13180.374s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Obviously, this is really complicated and expensive, but it's important, and we all know that Medford has the creativity and the collaboration and the spirit of service to get it done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13217.367s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to take paper 24028 out of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13261.64s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13265.502s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13265.742s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13266.662s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, can you hear me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13282.95s">[Kit Collins]</a>: 24028 offered by President Bayer's resolution calling on U.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13285.773s">[Kit Collins]</a>: government to end blockade of Cuba.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13289.957s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Whereas for 60 years, the United States has imposed an embargo on Cuba, having a devastating economic, social, and political impact on the people of Cuba.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13297.866s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And whereas U.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13298.887s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Senators Warren and Markey, U.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13300.729s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Representatives McGovern, Presley, Lynch, Moulton, and Tran,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13304.952s">[Kit Collins]</a>: city councils in neighborhood cities, and many state and local officials have called on the Biden administration to restore the policies of the Obama administration, reducing travel restrictions and removing Cuba from the state sponsors of terrorism list that were reversed under the Trump administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13319.164s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And whereas the continuation of this policy has a detrimental impact on Medford residents and organizations who have family, business and research ties with people and organizations in Cuba.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13329.612s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Medford city council that we urge the Biden administration<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13334.54s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and our congressional delegation to reverse the Trump decision to add Cuba to the state sponsors of terrorism list and restrict travel between the two countries and be it further resolved by the Medford City Council that we urge our congressional delegation to pass legislation to repeal any laws regarding the embargo on Cuba and be it further resolved that the city clerk please submit this resolution to the offices of Senator Warren, Senator Markey and Representative Clark.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13360.267s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13434.615s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13436.041s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any further comment from Councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13437.582s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13464.041s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any further comments from members of the Council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13467.028s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any members of the public who would wish to speak?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13495.327s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13497.368s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Feel free to approach the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13583.994s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Before we get to you, I'm just going to go to a hand raised on Zoom, then we'll get right along to the folks at the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13588.676s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm going to ask you to unmute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13589.897s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Please state your name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13817.267s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, Patrick, I think we have your address already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13923.049s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Patrick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13923.629s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it remains to be seen whether it's a zero-sum equation, but your comments are duly noted and appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13929.57s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mr. Castagnetti, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14158.541s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Do I have a second on the motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14160.663s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Callahan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14163.824s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Do folks want a roll call vote or is a voice vote fine?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14168.367s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14169.708s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Would you prefer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14170.268s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14171.549s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14172.63s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14173.09s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14177.25s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion passes with one note of dissent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14635.452s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14635.752s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll be brief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14636.873s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I thank the Councilor for bringing this forward often, either in meetings or out in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14642.996s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When we're talking about our business districts or squares, residents ask of Councilors, you know, why is XYZ business square like this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14651.981s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Why is this vacant?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14654.102s">[Kit Collins]</a>: How can we get X type of business in, you know, XYZ square?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14660.586s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's a pretty obvious limit to what a city can instruct commercial landlords to do with their property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14667.132s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But this is one tool that we could consider and possibly enact to try to incentivize our squares being full and lively and they're always being business tenants and available commercial space and so I'm excited to explore it further.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16135.626s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears this is kind of a procedural resolution to formally begin the zoning project which has been in a crescendo for longer than I've been on the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16149.443s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Right at the end of the previous term into the start of the new one we officially the city officially brought on the zoning consultant that this council selected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16157.707s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this is to assign the zoning project a new paper number and formally submit it to the planning and permitting committee so we can begin meeting with relevant staff and our zoning consultant to dive into that work in earnest on a motion for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16530.837s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Pierce?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16540.699s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16541.059s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16542.479s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One, I'd like to table 24036 to our next regularly scheduled meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16550.086s">[Kit Collins]</a>: is, why is that funny?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16552.531s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, here's what, here's something that will not endear me to my fellow Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16560.751s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, George.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16562.752s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm going to invoke rule 28, motion to reconsider 24021.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16566.553s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's the plant medicine resolution that we voted on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16570.135s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's the plant medicine resolution that we voted on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16572.756s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Previously in the evening, we took a vote to send it to committee as a member of the person who voted on the prevailing side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16580.139s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have the right to ask that the vote be reconsidered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16585.101s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'd like to, I don't know if it'll change the outcome, but the vote that I cast differed from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16716.834s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16717.774s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I do apologize to my fellow Councilors for bringing this back to the table, especially at this late hour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16723.217s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But to leave the meeting in good conscience, going into this meeting, having studied the resolution, having talked to advocates for it, I went in planning to support its passage tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16731.141s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My vote to send it to committee, I think, was more of my personal vote on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16738.564s">[Kit Collins]</a>: was more out of going with the flow than what was really in my plan or what was in my heart for this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16744.231s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I don't know if it will change the outcome, but I personally<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16748.666s">[Kit Collins]</a>: would like to retake that vote and have another opportunity to cast my vote for whether we should pass it symbolically tonight as an endorsement of the decriminalization policy, or if it is still the will of the council to send it to committee for further discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=11.852s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Vice Mayor Collins?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=14.533s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=17.934s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There will be a meeting of the Planning and Covering Committee, November 31st, 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=23.175s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The purpose of this meeting is to review the 2024-2025 Council Covering Agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=28.365s">[Kit Collins]</a>: as amended at the January 24, 2024 Committee of the Whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=55.882s">[Kit Collins]</a>: How about this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=57.242s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, I can hear myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=58.743s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this is our first meeting of the planning and permitting committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=66.105s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Vice Chair Leming is unable to be present for this meeting because he has a prior commitment, but he is the vice chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=76.971s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So much like our first committee meeting for the Administration and Finance Committee last night, the purpose of this meeting is to go over the section of the 2024-2025 Council Governing Agenda that pertains to projects in this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=91.895s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we have a bunch of projects and papers that have already been allocated to this committee for working on and discussing, and there are also<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=101.437s">[Kit Collins]</a>: papers in committee from previous terms of the Council, we can take a look at that section of our agenda, so to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=109.087s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It hasn't been totally fleshed out yet, but it will in coming weeks by myself and President Bears and other members of this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=117.87s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think much like last night, what it probably makes sense to do is to just quickly run through what is currently in the governing agenda under the planning and permitting committee auspices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=130.927s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sponsors of any projects can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=133.63s">[Kit Collins]</a>: give a brief synopsis or summarization of goals of those projects as they put forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=139.372s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If anybody has questions about new or old projects or papers in this committee, totally fair game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=146.334s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is the time to talk about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=149.956s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's a number of very large projects that will kind of be overarching in this committee throughout the term, in addition to ones that might be more quickly dispensed with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=157.318s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we'll also take a look at the draft timeline, which, of course, can be amended over the course of the term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=164.043s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Do any councilors have comments they'd like to make before we start taking a look at our governing agenda?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=171.376s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Hearing none, let me work on sharing my screen so we can look at that together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=197.679s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, is my screen visible for the, say, agendas and minutes at the top?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=204.801s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=205.761s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Clark.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=207.921s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just proceeding right along to the section of the governing agenda for the planning and permitting committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=217.203s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We went over this in some detail in our committee of the whole about the governing agenda overall, so I'm not going to go into great detail about, you know, we also have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=225.006s">[Kit Collins]</a>: sections of our code of ordinances that just live in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=227.527s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think this will probably be more relevant for other committees than it will be for ours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=231.128s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The thinking that if it comes the time for one of our recurring meetings and there's nothing to work on, we can be looking into our code of ordinances to bring up to date other ordinances that fall under our jurisdiction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=243.351s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think that'll be a problem for this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=244.812s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we have a ton to work on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=246.432s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think we'll have a lot of dead time during our meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=249.413s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we can always revisit this first section if we need to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=254.179s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So it makes sense to first talk about or at least first look at zoning reform.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=259.58s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a huge project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=260.76s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This will probably organize most of the other projects within this committee over the course of the next 23 months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=269.582s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears and I have initiated, I mean, this project has been initiated at the very end of last term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=277.524s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The council selected a zoning consultant to work with this council to structure this process to provide<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=285.117s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, specialized expertise in implementing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=287.895s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the comprehensive plan, the housing production plan, the climate adaptation plan, other known goals and shared values that this community has, that the administration has, that this council has, and make sure that those are borne out in a comprehensive review and updating of the zoning process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=302.002s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we're working on finding a date for Planning, Development, and Sustainability staff and the zoning consultant to come before this committee just to serve as a public introductory meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=311.927s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we can talk about the timeline and structure for that project, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=349.605s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Harreld.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=350.586s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just to clarify, do you think what would be valuable is sort of like goals or maybe like last action taken?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=357.43s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is why this is here right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=382.194s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=382.554s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=382.834s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just making a note of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=384.215s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think we can definitely, as we start to spin up our process of sort of end of month updating of the governing agenda, we can certainly workshop that and figure out a way to just quickly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=395.342s">[Kit Collins]</a>: make sure that that like one or two sentences for each project is being revised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=402.405s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this, the structuring, the breaking down this very large two-year project into manageable pieces is something that this committee will be working on in concert with NS Associates, which is the zoning consultant that this council selected, and Planning Development and Sustainability staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=420.412s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But the overall approach, I think, will be to take<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=425.731s">[Kit Collins]</a>: our ambitious goals of reviewing and updating all of our zoning ordinances, find a way to organize that by goal, by topic, by category, so that we can be doing those updates, be making those updates in a way that makes sense and is efficient.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=440.415s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's certainly a lot for us to get through in two years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=443.536s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So what that organization, what that structure looks like is something that we will be meeting about and talking about in coming weeks and months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=453.399s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=624.12s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I really appreciate that kind of approach to how to work through this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=628.243s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that I think that some version of that approach is what we will inevitably end up doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=633.626s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that one way we might come to that approach is we are working with planning development<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=643.325s">[Kit Collins]</a>: kind of have a two track approach to breaking this down into manageable pieces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=649.052s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that our zoning consultant might have a perspective on what categories<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=653.126s">[Kit Collins]</a>: might make sense to work on together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=654.586s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then of course, from this council being representatives of the community and being very well versed in these plans, we then, I think it is, in my opinion, as one councilor, I think it's our role to then come to those topics with a set of priorities and say, this is our priority for what we do in the realm of doing something that affects housing stock, housing density, housing character.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=677.851s">[Kit Collins]</a>: based on what we know from our plans, based on what we know from constituents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=682.734s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that individual Councilors getting very specific on what we would like to do in certain categories, something that we could certainly start to do at any time, and I think that when we are able to sync up with NS associates and planning staff in the next few weeks about what kind of timeline we might be looking at as we work to develop that timeline of what we'll work on when, that might give us some clarity on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=707.273s">[Kit Collins]</a>: when could we collectively have those conversations about what's going on our punch list and figure out a process from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=715.955s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=716.796s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that I suspect that we all have in our heads those specifics that we're shooting for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=723.958s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And quite soon will come the time, sooner than we know it, will come the time to start implementing those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=856.377s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=857.077s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's a really important point with anything, and especially with a project of this scale that we've been gearing up to for such a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=865.701s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it'll be really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=868.062s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well, to me, I'm thinking a lot about budgeting time for this project, because it's such a big, ambitious project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=872.503s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that avoiding duplicating efforts will be really crucial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=876.085s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it dovetails with what Councilor Callaghan was saying about how and when are we getting organized to make sure that we're doing what we want to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=882.728s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Tsenglin, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1089.244s">[Kit Collins]</a>: By all means.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1096.388s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is my living room, George.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1188.985s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you Councilor Tseng I actually think that's a really helpful point to bring up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1194.247s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let me just so that we can look at this visually, as we're talking about kind of timing of projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1200.209s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It makes a lot of sense to me especially that those three projects you mentioned would be very relevant to my gosh here it is finally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1209.892s">[Kit Collins]</a>: would be relevant to our zoning work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1213.093s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I would say to that specific point and to any councilors on this committee, as research into projects continues, as councilors start to get specific on the parameters of projects outside of zoning, especially those that align with zoning, just to feel free to be in communication with me as chair of this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1235.313s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One, to keep the governing agenda updated with what we plan to work on and when, but also if they're, say, for example, green score, I think it intuitively makes a lot of sense to work on that at the same time as some, you know, developer and building standards that will be picked into our zoning code.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1251.106s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We can make sure that as the timeline for breaking zoning into parts gets solidified with our zoning consultant, we can make sure that we're scheduling these things in alignment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1287.101s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I may make a suggestion, again, to what Councilor Callahan brought up earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1295.408s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that we're going to eventually be going, we're going to collectively decide on a sequence through which to work through all of these topics comprised of zoning will decide that collectively will have a draft schedule like all of our other schedules will be amendable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1310.799s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sure that we will all have our separate version of planning and homework and research that will go into the work and the priorities that will take to the zoning discussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1319.507s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If it feels helpful to Councilors, I would be happy as chair to be sort of repository for those notes, lists, lists of priorities and goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1330.1s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that we are going to be working on sort of, as council leadership, matching our main goals and priorities for zoning overall and bringing those to Innes Associates to help draft that sequence of zoning work to bring to this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1343.028s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If councilors feel it'd be helpful to, as they're devising lists of priorities on your own time in preparation for our meetings, I would be happy to be a repository for those ideas and then make sure that they are brought up again when we get to the relevant topics in our zoning work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1364.608s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Anything else on zoning right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1367.049s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Priorities, questions, questions around timing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1375.451s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well, we're going to spend a million more hours talking about it, so let's put a pin in it there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1379.473s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We can come back to it later in this meeting if anything else occurs to Councilors or members of the public, but I'll scroll up again to the start of the section on ordinances, and we can run through that list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1394.304s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So like Councilor Tseng mentioned, a lot of our other legislative projects will align with zoning to a greater or lesser extent, and some of them won't, and that's okay too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1407.487s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just to run quickly down the list of ordinances that are also in this committee, the Condo Conversion Ordinance, this is one that I'm leading on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1414.169s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We started work on this last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1417.998s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The goal of this is to create some conditions and permitting procedures around when rental units are taken off the market by for-profit developers and turned into condos to make sure that the community recaptures some of that value that is just being realized as real estate value.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1437.056s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The status on that is there was a bunch of takeaways and great research questions from our last meeting, which was sometime last fall, that I have to follow up with the building commissioner about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1445.359s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I hope that we can get about that quite soon and get it passed by May.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1453.002s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Next, we have housing home rule petitions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1456.444s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's a few here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1457.824s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Real estate transfer fee, tenant first right of refusal, and rent stabilization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1463.406s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These were originally proposed<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1465.996s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want, oh it was 20, it was 2022, we know from the paper number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1469.517s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I believe the local context for when these papers were introduced to this council was when a particularly visible eviction event was happening in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1483.002s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But we know from the community that petitioning the state for greater power to protect tenants in Medford and do what we can locally to stabilize the cost of rent is something that is important to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1495.164s">[Kit Collins]</a>: many people in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1496.945s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so these are not ordinances, but home rule petitions that we can discuss here in this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1504.491s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any questions on these before we move down to a fee schedule?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1510.735s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears, would you like to briefly describe the fee schedule project?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1651.902s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1653.243s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is your thinking at this point that this will be a process we go through department by department?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1657.326s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Or do you have any other thoughts on how we might meet this out over the term?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1721.323s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sounds great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1721.964s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1724.056s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1788.842s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1789.722s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears, Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1792.263s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sounds like that will be pretty straightforward to dispense with, hopefully meaningful for many of our city departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1798.916s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Continuing down the line, next cycling safety ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1801.218s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a project that I proposed, I haven't formally proposed it, project that I have proposed to propose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1807.965s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The goal of this ordinance would be to align with the city's complete streets project and work with the DPW to see if there are some standards we can create legislatively to ensure that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1822.571s">[Kit Collins]</a>: bike safety infrastructure projects are always considered when road renovation is already being done in the city or see what else we can do along those lines towards the value of increasing safety for all road users.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1876.547s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=1877.507s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2054.365s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2055.505s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2056.305s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think it's also a really an evergreen reminder of how important it is in the conversation of the fee schedule more broadly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2065.369s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So important to be really transparent with the public about, yes, it's a revenue thing, but in service of the things that we all<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2074.873s">[Kit Collins]</a>: need and see the lack of funding and I think that really makes it a less bitter pill to swallow to realize that this revenue is going towards things that are chronically underfunded and then we'll all be happy to see better funded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2089.946s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well, speaking of transportation, we next go to Transportation Demand Management.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2095.49s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Tseng, would you like to give us a brief description of this project?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2098.012s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2229.226s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Very interesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2229.927s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2234.47s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Next, we have some proposed ordinances that I think are linked to energy disclosure and benchmarking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2242.196s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Then we also have the rental license ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2245.419s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Callahan, were all of these your brainchild?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2308.462s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2309.302s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That makes that linkage makes a lot of sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2316.205s">[Kit Collins]</a>: While we're on this topic, let me scroll back down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2322.308s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You could also speak to the rental licensing if you would like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2325.89s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2326.73s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanted to note, I think we would be good at some point soon, not necessarily right this minute, especially since the city clerk has reminded me that the Public Works Committee is beginning at 7 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2337.443s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As these conversations continue on, as we start to get a sequence on paper for the zoning timeline, it would be great to start drafting some goal start dates and end dates for those ordinances, because I don't think we have them yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2352.057s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So open to hearing thoughts on that at any time, inside or outside of the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2359.183s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Cheng?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2512.391s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2513.412s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's an exciting project, and it makes sense that our first step should be to investigate the extent to which a possible state legislation might be relevant here, or if we should not bother.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2526.08s">[Kit Collins]</a>: waiting for that to become relevant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2528.642s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let's move quickly through the rest of these projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2534.885s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Rental licensing, would you like a quick description?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2646.898s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It would also help with the implementation of the Housing Stability Notification Ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2651.083s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So lots of great reasons to, yeah, which has been, I think, a major challenge in disseminating that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2658.951s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So lots of great reasons to prioritize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2660.713s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2663.154s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Moving right along, just in the interest of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2667.076s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Next, Councilor Tseng, would you like to speak to pesticide regulations, blasting, green score?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2777.365s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2779.346s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2783.268s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then, like I said up top, we also have some ongoing projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2788.203s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that are under our jurisdiction for ongoing engagement oversight, including the Subcommittee on Licensing, Permitting, and Signs, chaired by Councilors Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2797.486s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I believe we're having a meeting next week, Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2801.487s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2801.887s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2803.467s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that will be a subcommittee that meets frequently and as needed to go over those sign applications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2812.59s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We also have some projects in here under ongoing oversight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2819.062s">[Kit Collins]</a>: energy efficiency retrofits for existing buildings, transit signal priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2826.026s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have a couple minutes if Councilors want to give a brief overview of those projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2855.227s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2857.349s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Tseng, would you like to briefly describe transit signal priority?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2903.373s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Tsenghia.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2904.353s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I understand from my conversations with Director Blake that this is a project for which there is a ton of appetite in the city, and we're just lacking some of those crucial millions of dollars to do exactly what we want to do, what we know constituents would love.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2919.479s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I'm sure that there's ways that we can collaborate to move the ball forward this term on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2923.74s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you for bringing that forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2925.221s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=2964.962s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What paper is that, sorry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=3259.019s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you president bears I think, and I appreciate the framework of that comments in the context that we have more than enough in this current governing agenda to work on at this committee this term at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=3269.783s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think, taking into account the perspective that you just shared other anecdotes from the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=3278.314s">[Kit Collins]</a>: current structure of the traffic commission with mandatory members as opposed to a more representative model.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=3285.799s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It strikes me as something that's certainly at least worth discussing other models that might make more sense for our community regardless of whether this committee decides to pursue that this term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=3296.785s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So with that we've done our speed run overview of everything that we will definitely fully complete this term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=3304.59s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you to my fellow councillors for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=3310.638s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For any final comments from my fellow Councilors, I would just like to invite everyone, like I said, when we were finishing up our short conversation about zoning, if Councilors, as we're preparing for our sequential digestion of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=3328.777s">[Kit Collins]</a>: zoning topic if Councilors are so moved to submit to me top line priorities for our discussion that we can then batch into categories with the consultant and with planning staff or more nitty gritty versions of those lists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=3345.006s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Please feel free to forward those along to myself as chair ahead of time where we can store those for the appropriate meetings when those topics come up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=3354.511s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would also ask<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=3356.95s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilors, if there are any projects that are in this committee, once they've been proposed, if they don't currently have start and end goal dates, please do submit those to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=3364.818s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That'll be important as we do the monthly updating of the governing agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=3370.183s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any final comments?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=3400.486s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Was there another energy-related paper that should be in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=3421.25s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=3421.47s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that's a motion from President Bears to move transit demand management and green score under the zoning paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=3428.851s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Do I have a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=3429.772s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Callahan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=3434.113s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On the motion, all in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=3437.193s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=3438.534s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=3441.389s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any final comments from councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=3442.65s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Callahan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=3443.831s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I move to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=3445.432s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to adjourn from Councilor Callahan, seconded by President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=3448.194s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=3449.094s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=3450.015s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=3450.935s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FrIQvitIEmA&t=3451.676s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=9.795s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=12.097s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=13.317s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=14.659s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=1168.383s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=1168.763s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I think that looking over the kind of the evolution of the draft ordinances will be most instructive for the newer councilors, but the original form of the ordinance spoke to both the annual budget process and also laid out a fairly prescribed structure for long-term budget planning, kind of revisiting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=1190.268s">[Kit Collins]</a>: five-year financial forecast regular intervals with the administration the same way as it creates a structure for looking at the annual operating budget with the administration every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=1201.777s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The administration has told us a lot about the various reasons why that is a difficult thing for them to operationalize at this point, but we still think that there's value in creating a kind of starter structure for how to begin to have those conversations in a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=1218.73s">[Kit Collins]</a>: regular way, even if we are not being as ambitious as the original form of the ordinance laid out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=1225.577s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So to me, that is the most unfinished part of the ordinance, trying to figure out what can we start so that we are planting a seed for that kind of structure, while not legislating a process that the administration right now doesn't have the capacity to do every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=1492.776s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well, I know that this is something I was actually going to ask about President Bears, which is why I grimaced after I touched my microphone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=1500.441s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The classification and compensation study is a project that the administration initiated with the Collins Center, if I have that right to take a look at how we are compensating the various roles in City Hall to try to get context on if things are roughly right, you know, and this is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=1521.926s">[Kit Collins]</a>: would inform the types of salaries that we're putting out in our attempt to keep positions filled by competitive candidates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=1530.228s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So a question that I have is the status on how complete that study is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=1535.429s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then I believe that the implementation for this council would be in, because pay rates to an extent live in our code of ordinances, personnel ordinances, that would be something for us to take out of the study and implement through our personnel ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=1839.013s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was going to suggest perhaps to request the update come in a week before our next scheduled meeting of this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=1845.899s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=1846.4s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Which would be...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=1850.499s">[Kit Collins]</a>: by February 20th, if we go that route.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2613.439s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2613.799s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I think it's an important point to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2616.18s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I mean, in general, I think the point of these initial meetings and committees, the point of the governing agenda is to try to budget our work over this term to be manageable for Councilors and for projects to occur in the right order to be most effective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2632.687s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that the way that the various<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2639.366s">[Kit Collins]</a>: commercial vacancy tax, for example, these various exemptions that we've considered in the past, the new ones that we're considering, the way that those will intersect with a potential override or debt exclusion is kind of an interesting problem, kind of to the overall topic of like, then what order do we do things in, especially with the exemptions, which we know, the assessor's office requires like a fairly long runway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2664.412s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to be able to implement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2665.733s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that, I mean for myself, for the Good Lord and Lord Tax Credit, as that's a paper that I introduced, I think that the approach may be to study the issue, try to do the research, have the conversations, get our ducks in a row, perhaps like create some scenarios, and then as the conversations about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2683.839s">[Kit Collins]</a>: revenue forecasting potential changes to property tax because of a debt exclusion or override, kind of have some scenarios ready to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2692.225s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And of course, I think in some cases, we might want to deploy several strategies at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2697.589s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If, for example, say we're doing a debt exclusion for a new high school, hypothetically, it occurs to me that that might be a thing that our finance department might say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2710.638s">[Kit Collins]</a>: let's sit down and consider these three to four financial mechanisms together instead of doing these very related things in separate channels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2720.741s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think that we can certainly pursue all of these projects in committee and really get our arms around the issue and study, could maybe create a set of if-then conditions for these various exemptions and new mechanisms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2749.182s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Can you put the screen to Rebecca?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2751.104s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For just a sec.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2846.173s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I just wanted to take a look, see if there's anything I was forgetting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2856.162s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think in general, I feel pretty happy with the draft timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2860.745s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that we're looking at here in the governing agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2863.026s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that this, for the most part, organizes our projects in what I would consider a list of priority and also a list of urgency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2873.392s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's very important to start implementing the classification and compensation study as soon as that data becomes available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2881.456s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's, of course, the annual budget process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2887.099s">[Kit Collins]</a>: is fixed in the first half of each year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2889.981s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think for the reasons we just discussed, it'll be important to discuss the commercial vacancy tax and the good landlord tax credit earlier rather than later, so that if those are things that we do want to deploy, we can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2904.85s">[Kit Collins]</a>: at a time that makes sense because they take a long time to implement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2908.013s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that that will set us up well for these other projects that we currently have slated for 2025, which of course are also very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2917.34s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's why they're up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2918.141s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's why they've been suggested by current Councilors, former Councilors, members of the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2924.265s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think that this roughly follows order of need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=228.468s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=229.368s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that plan sounds great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=230.749s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Of course, with such a long document, of course, this is sketching out everything that we aspire to do over the next two years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=236.55s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that probably the best use of our time is to, as we're going through this, if there's things that Councilors, kind of reiterating what you just said, if there's things that Councilors have questions on, like, I don't understand what this project is that we're<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=247.892s">[Kit Collins]</a>: proposing to be referred to committee or if something seems incomplete.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=251.435s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Essentially, if there are any critical substance-related flags, I think that this is a good time to quickly go over those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=257.581s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But in general, a lot of these projects we have touched on before, either previous term, in this term, we were talking about creating this document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=267.389s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think this is a great time to kind of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=270.475s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've all had several days to look at this after a couple weeks to submit our own proposals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=275.697s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then, of course, the deep dives will occur in committee for any of the projects that get referred there, assuming that most, if not all, of these will end up getting referred.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=286.339s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=897.397s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well, thank you for bringing that up because I was internally debating whether to say I noticed the percent for our ordinance was, as we can see from the paper number introduced in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=908.532s">[Kit Collins]</a>: year 2020.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=909.112s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's a good one to bring forward and see if we can get to it this term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=914.455s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Despite my day job, I don't need to be the lead Councilor on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=917.417s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I just throw that out to Councilor Callahan and all my fellow Councilors if anybody sees this and wants to take point on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=924.182s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would gladly relinquish my sponsorship or share leadership with somebody else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=1075.778s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, my aspiration is to check in with all committee chairs monthly to say, where are we at on what and update this document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=1085.769s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If that cadence doesn't quite work out, I think certainly keeping it updated on at least quarterly basis so we can track where we are and perhaps update further start dates accordingly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=1095.892s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that's the plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=1096.732s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=1508.992s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=1509.352s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=1510.192s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it strikes me, going off of what Councilor Ziaro noted about some committees being, going into this process more flush with ordinances and projects than others, I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=1523.181s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I assume that we'll see some of the work of some of these committees will be more straightforwardly legislative related to, you know, our official functions, promulgating policies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=1532.233s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Others, like perhaps the Education and Culture Committee is a good example of this, their role will be more broadcasting, engaging, synergistic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=1541.957s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, just in line with the, the topic of those committees and I think that would be a great way to organize kind of the various functions that this council serves between broadcasting events, helping to be a liaison between community partners city hall partners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=1558.964s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that that will be a good way for us to budget our capacity because probably realistically if we were working on a full slate of ordinances and every committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=1567.588s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's only so many Tuesdays and Wednesdays in the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=1570.129s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think this will be a great way for us to get a lot done and do the best that we can to complete all the projects that we set out to complete.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=1978.934s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Certainly, I think that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=1983.172s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The way I've been conceptualizing this governing agenda overall has been to try to, you know, and of course, as we've been saying, it's a, it's a living, evolvable document, but I think that this is a tool through which we can try to project magic to ourselves, because in this committee alone, there's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=1998.576s">[Kit Collins]</a>: certainly two years worth of work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2001.299s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thinking through how to prioritize and how to structure and schedule these projects so that we can get to everything that we want to get to for the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2011.189s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that this is a topic that we can revisit as a committee in our first couple of meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2015.834s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2019.122s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Zoning reform is certainly going to be the characteristic project of this committee and indeed of this council this term, one of our major projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2026.128s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that will live in this committee and I think that so many of the major projects and ordinances that have been proposed for planning and permitting do dovetail with our zoning reform.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2035.957s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Some very closely some are related.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2038.339s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2039.6s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it might make sense for us to begin a conversation in committee about organizing our year, you know, the work in this committee around zoning reform and structuring ordinance projects around that based on what we're talking about and when and how to make sure that our work is aligned and how to, you know, if we're touching on a topic, let's touch on it at the same time and hopefully get through our work efficiently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2063.369s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's just because there are so many projects lined up for this committee, and they're all good ones, and we should try to get to all of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2440.896s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's probably a lot to be said on this, so I'm happy to take, you know, one swing at the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2445.679s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that there's many answers to the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2447.12s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it, in general, depends on the project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2450.081s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that, for me, I've always found it valuable to involve potential partners and stakeholders and experts and staff that are related to the project early.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2464.269s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Of course, it depends on what you are trying to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2466.61s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Like we've talked about, some of our projects are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2471.041s">[Kit Collins]</a>: serving as liaison to bring together people who could work on implementing a program that's outside of our legal jurisdiction, but it's something that we have the platform to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2480.796s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There are other cases where it is an ordinance that is something that we have the power to promulgate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2485.219s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If we're thinking about how to tailor this in a way that enforcement is going to go most successfully because we can do the legislation we don't do the enforcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2492.885s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I found it valuable to involve those city staff and other partners who'd be involved in enforcement and implementation early in the process so that what we are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2502.151s">[Kit Collins]</a>: creating can be that balance between in line with our values and our aspiration, and achievable and actionable and doable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2509.236s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think the short answer is, there's no right answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2513.619s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I found it valuable if, since most of our projects are deeply collaborative, it's I think it's completely fine to involve collaborators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2521.724s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Before the paper is formally introduced, as soon as it's formally introduced at the first meeting at the second meeting, depending on your goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3891.838s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3892.659s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate the, the question around this just, and I think that's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3898.844s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, the best encapsulation in terms of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3902.006s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, for the newer Councilors in the room in terms of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3905.421s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the ways that this frequently comes to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3907.162s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Certainly, we all have some level of understanding of the problem in its totality and why we're here and for how long it's been going on and the big pieces of why the problem is so widespread, which is our incredibly high percentage of private ways and very old infrastructure and a lot of rehabilitation and renovation that needs to be done and is incredibly expensive that we can't currently right now pay for, capital improvements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3935.157s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In my experience, how this comes up to the council on a week-by-week, month-by-month basis is residents continue to raise the issue, as is their right, and it's important for us to be a forum for them to come to with questions, whether it's, this keeps happening, who can I talk to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3952.304s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Or this keeps happening and I live on a private way, and we very frequently have to be the bearer of bad news because it is incredibly financially burdensome to people who live on private ways to do<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3965.445s">[Kit Collins]</a>: ideal renovations in many of those cases and it is also financially infeasible for the city at this point to just assume all of those private ways because they have to be brought to code first and that's millions and millions of dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3979.372s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So in my experience, when constituents come to this body and they say, hey, me and my neighbors have been having this problem, it's an opportunity to have a conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3987.858s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we've had that conversation at least many times in the one term that I've served so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3992.121s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it's a way to convey that information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=3993.942s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think it's a way to continue to resurface the kind of the bottom line issues that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4000.677s">[Kit Collins]</a>: partners in City Hall and the PPW engineering are already working on that is, you know, unfortunately, but necessarily long term projects and deeply involved with the capital future of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4879.796s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4882.108s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Like we talked about at the beginning of the meeting, I think it makes sense for council leadership to keep a relatively close eye on this document and be in communication with committee chairs to make sure that this document stays useful by staying up to date on a reasonable timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4895.832s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I would motion for council leadership to review this governing agenda monthly and for the full council to review it every six months in late June and late December so that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4908.567s">[Kit Collins]</a>: as a cohort, we are discussing and keeping updated with what's where, how things are progressing, if timelines or goals need to be adjusted, that we're making those decisions as a group twice yearly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1046.343s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for being here, Representative Donato.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1048.045s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry to make you stand up again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1048.946s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Feel free to say so if this is a question, but are directed to the folks at the Office of Housing and Livable Communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1055.493s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So these migrant, sorry, these temporary shelters are being set up because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1060.267s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're at a crisis level in terms of the lack of shelter space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1064.969s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You mentioned the permanent shelters that are coming online to be sort of the more long-term solution to this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1072.252s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Can you provide any sense of the status of the permanent shelters that are being set up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1123.505s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1123.865s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1124.506s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And the reason we're here in the first place is because even<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1127.571s">[Kit Collins]</a>: permanent, sorry, the longer term shelter beds in the hotels and motels, those are actually, we don't have as many beds as we used to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1167.477s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1972.295s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1974.036s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Representative Donato, sorry, another question for you, if you're willing to speak to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1978.619s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In the couple weeks since the mayor started circulating information about this temporary shelter, I've heard from a number of residents who have asked, you know, obviously folks are coming here because they're in this crisis situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1989.705s">[Kit Collins]</a>: How can we as Medford residents help these folks who might be coming temporarily into our community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1994.128s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know, again, this might be one of the many questions<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=1996.343s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That can only be answered by our partners at the state level, but is there anything you can share about folks that here in Medford can have on their radar about how to help out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2054.652s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Understood, Representative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2055.533s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2055.833s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think it's very clear that the bottleneck here is at the state level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=2058.716s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you for the updates that you're able to provide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=4214.431s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to suspend the rules and take 23474.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5074.939s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Pierce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5076.7s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Manager Ripley, commissioners, thank you so much for being here today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5078.822s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate the diligence and effort gone into the after action report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5083.165s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate my fellow councilors' comments on this so far, and I think that my initial observations from the report follow the same trends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5092.813s">[Kit Collins]</a>: really appreciate that this is kind of a comprehensive overview of the beginning to end of the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5098.235s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I agree, I think that, you know, for myself as one Councilor, I was hoping for kind of that diagnosis of, you know, these issues that we raised before the election, on election day, after the election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5112.079s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5114.386s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Everybody can relate to, you know, when you're looking at something that didn't go the way that you wanted it to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5119.888s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have to start out, okay, what exactly, what were we shooting for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5124.349s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Didn't quite happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5125.569s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You need to know the why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5126.63s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We need to know the why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5128.07s">[Kit Collins]</a>: None of this is personal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5130.271s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But as Councilors, as electeds, as representatives, as a community,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5135.272s">[Kit Collins]</a>: if we're going to have faith that our three very consequential elections this year, which are going to see much higher turnout probably than the one in November did, if we can trust and tell the community to trust that those are going to go as well as we know that we can, we need to know exactly why, exactly what we're going to do differently than what we did in November in the lead up to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5156.398s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So, you know, for example, you know, I appreciate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5162.881s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For example, under election preparation, you're noting every part of that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5167.765s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You mentioned at this point in time, we have destroyed all old supplies from the state, talking about the information sheet that was sent in and mail-in ballots that referenced an election in 2022.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5177.532s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5178.393s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For example, I would love to see<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5180.498s">[Kit Collins]</a>: or maybe talk about in subcommittee, if that's a more reasonable timeline for this, what is our policy for when old elections materials are destroyed or removed from the office so that we know they will never be put in a ballot for which they're irrelevant, that kind of procedure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5199.448s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, similarly, I know one of the issues that I was hearing the most about on election day was the interfacing of wardens and voters at the polls around things like voter guides or how people were checked in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5215.044s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Totally heard that most of the wardens did a fine job, you know, did the role that they were hired to perform.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5223.831s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, this is one of the areas of the city where we really have to strive for perfection because voting rights are inalienable and we have to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5235.706s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's just essential that everybody has the full accessibility to their vote and everything that comes along with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5243.231s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this is why this has been a project for us to deliberate on this and meet on this and want to go over this to make sure that we're all entering into a resilient election year together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5255.638s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that the interfacing between the poll workers and those going to the polls, that is an issue where we have to, again, we have to strive for perfection every single time because it's a voter enfranchisement issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5266.369s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's a confidence issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5269.389s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know on the issue of staffing, that's one that we brought up when we raised this paper to begin with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5276.793s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And among our questions and directives, it's not just for this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5279.695s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And again, I really thank you for the detail you've put into this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5283.137s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We also had a motion to the administration to say, clearly there's a staffing need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5287.86s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's a demonstrated, there's an articulated staffing need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5290.321s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We wanna know how we can help expedite that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5292.843s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this council is pretty young.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5295.704s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The previous council was unified in saying,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5299.056s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the election department needs staff, let's get it staffed up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5303.604s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But if we need to dial down on that to get specific on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5307.318s">[Kit Collins]</a>: here's exactly what we need in the next budget cycle for a fully staffed elections department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5312.862s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let's have those conversations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5314.504s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If we need to get specific about here's how many wardens and poll workers that we had for the November, 2023 election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5321.569s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it was a little thin and we know that turnout is going to be different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5325.712s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So here's what we need to shoot for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5327.093s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And let's talk about and communicate and make public the plan for getting to that number as close as we can to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5333.498s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that these are conversations that would really behoove us to go over publicly, you know, for our edification and again for that project of reestablishing some of the confidence that has been lost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5347.803s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And ideally, hopefully to, you know, add to the efforts of advertising the poll worker positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5359.284s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate Councilor Scarpelli's motion to continue this conversation in a subcommittee of the government's committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5365.352s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that that will really help us to flesh out some of the additional detail and specific next steps that we'd like to see beyond this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=5373.863s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And again, I thank you for your time and for all your hard work all year round.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8191.257s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8192.017s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to again thank you for the level of depth in this conversation tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8195.399s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And, you know, I know that there's always an appetite for going deeper and working together to help us better understand the workings of your office and go over<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8206.26s">[Kit Collins]</a>: your goings-on, you know, talking about successes as well as the problems that, you know, I know that we have a shared goal of shoring up every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8215.406s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm glad to end this conversation or put a pin in it for now, you know, on the issue of resources and capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8222.99s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think in our ongoing conversations, I think that we'd all, you know, benefit from taking the time when it's available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8230.355s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Certainly I can understand that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8232.196s">[Kit Collins]</a>: November didn't go the way that any of us thought that it would.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8235.258s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And of course, that has an impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8236.498s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's a limited number of hours in the day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8241.281s">[Kit Collins]</a>: To have those conversations about the specificity that we're looking for so we can have that transparency piece, the prescription, the what would fix it, and a prescription is not a solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8251.546s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, the solution is we're going to get the prescription will be implemented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8255.528s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know that that is a multi-agency effort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8259.99s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm hoping that we can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8263.268s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What was that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8265.669s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm looking forward to that collaboration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8268.05s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And thank you for your, thank you for your willingness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=8485.868s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'd like to withdraw the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9344.687s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9346.827s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Appreciate the discussion around this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9350.999s">[Kit Collins]</a>: either the third or the fourth time that we've discussed this in these chambers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9357.547s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I, as we've said before, I appreciate the dialogue with my colleagues about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9362.853s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate the very many community members that we've heard from about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9370.37s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I withdrew my motion and I'll second Councilor Tseng's motion because I believe that this is the most actionable compromise that we have on the table right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9378.796s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My alternative proposal went even further.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9380.757s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It would have achieved pay parity between the school committee and the city council by 2027.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9384.019s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As I've said at the beginning of all of our conversations on this topic, I really believe that pay equity between the school committee and the city council is the right thing to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9394.826s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that somebody has to be the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9396.747s">[Kit Collins]</a>: First person to do the right thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9397.829s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't know if that'll be us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9399.933s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that we need to move the ball forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9403.57s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As a Councilor, I don't know what the, I don't know what a day in the life of a school committee member looks like, but I know a little bit about the role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9411.197s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know that the role is different in every community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9414.44s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know a little bit about what it means in our city from our charter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9418.564s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I believe that our roles are equivalent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9420.185s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I believe that the role of the school committee is mission critical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9423.168s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I believe that there's no space for passivity in that role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9425.53s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's why I believe that our role should be paid equally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9428.833s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, so this proposal advances compensation for school committee members at percentages that are aligned with MTA contract increases over the past 24 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9441.107s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In any case, I think, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9444.379s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to the headlines of this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9445.52s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's been 24 years since there's been a pay adjustment for the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9452.527s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a one-time adjustment spread out over two years, and then it stops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9457.892s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've already referred to the governance committee, apart from the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9462.937s">[Kit Collins]</a>: motion that will vote on from Councilor Callahan, the recommendation to study within the concept of our, sorry, within the review of our city charter, which we'll be doing later this year, a mechanism for triggering some sort of automatic or regular evaluation of all elected salaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9478.585s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9480.655s">[Kit Collins]</a>: not so that the salaries necessarily go up, but I think that part of the issue here has been, since there was not any sort of regular mechanism other than the city council deigning to consider an increase, we've gone 24 years without considering it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9495.665s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's why the initial proposal was for a triple-digit percentage increase, because we had so much time to make up for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9504.096s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So with all that being said, I'm glad that we're going to have that conversation later this year so that we can continue having this conversation about how to align compensation with our goals and our values and how to promote the elected bodies that our community deserves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9521.611s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm looking forward to voting on compensation increase, one that I believe is fair and reasonable and very certainly the product of compromise tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9530.619s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11049.237s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11052.298s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, is there a song going on in the chambers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11054.94s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I thought I heard something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11056.901s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've already made my thoughts on this clear in our subsequent couple of meetings, but just before I move the question, just to put a couple facts out on the table, especially since I know a lot of our deep conversation about this occurred in committee of the whole last week, but residents, I think it's easier to tune in during these regular meetings rather than committees of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11077.148s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I wouldn't want this conversation to seem truncated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11079.869s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just to remind folks that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11082.927s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There was a whole conversation, discussion, disagreement, predicating this conversation and vote that we're going to take tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11091.051s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I said this the first time that this issue came before us, but where I'm coming from on this is really that I just completely believe that we can do more than one right thing at a time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11101.136s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This proposal, the original proposal, which this is less than, was 0.05% of a $200 billion operating budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11114.468s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that we need to challenge ourselves to do more than one right thing at a time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11117.949s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I really appreciate the reminder that if we think that paying one city employee fairly is a grievance to another, then we are phrasing the question incorrectly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11135.313s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And this has always been a tough topic to talk about because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11142.591s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have so much work to do when it comes to paying all of our city employees fairly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11147.055s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think what's been painful about this process is the knowledge that so many of those issues are unresolved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11154.401s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's not okay, and it's not acceptable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11156.702s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is the one opportunity that this council has legally to instigate a pay increase for any city employee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11165.57s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is the one appropriation that we get, and it's kind of a weird quirk of our power.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11171.514s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But as<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11172.802s">[Kit Collins]</a>: folks who are familiar with our work and the parameters of our jurisdiction know, when it comes to the budget and its appropriations, we get to vote yes or no, and that is it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11181.529s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We cannot appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11183.751s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so this does put us in this awkward position where we can instigate these compensation adjustments, and we can't do that directly for anybody else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11191.657s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think for that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11195.272s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that we do in these chambers the entire rest of the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11197.874s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a really unusual topic for us to be talking about the entire rest of the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11201.717s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we can be we can challenge ourselves to be the allies that the community deserves by supporting all other city employees and bargaining units by one vocally supporting them and standing with them and advocating for them and also by doing the bulk of the work of this council, which is doing the ordinances and the zoning and the business development work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11222.011s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in this chambers in collaboration with the administration, in collaboration with private partners that will bring up the city's bottom line and enable us to, as swiftly as we can, roll out improved living wages for all city employees, because that is all of our goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11238.317s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do not believe that this stands in the way of that goal, and that goal is not diminished by this change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11243.679s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's my opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11245.06s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Move the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=280.353s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=281.714s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, everybody, for being here today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=284.376s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=285.236s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A lot to discuss here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=287.978s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just want to start by saying I know that this discussion of this in the community has surfaced some painful and necessary truths about the underfunding of the schools and the need to provide every school worker with a living wage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=303.545s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate that that's been one of the reminders that's come out of the discussion I just want to frame with that as a reassurance that as we talk about raising compensation for school committee for the first time in 23 years that that is close on my mind to speak only for myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=322.603s">[Kit Collins]</a>: City Council is no legal authority to make allocations within the school's budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=327.505s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sure that there's been times when we all wish we had that authority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=330.827s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We don't have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=333.027s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is one thing that we do have authority over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=336.669s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The mindset that I'm coming to this discussion with is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=341.823s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We know it's been 23 years since school committee had a cost of living adjustment or any sort of rationale for a compensation increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=350.167s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As a Councilor with a vote to change that, I feel a responsibility to change that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=354.429s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's something that I have the responsibility to change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=356.69s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We don't have any jurisdiction over any other salaries when it comes to the school's department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=361.392s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is one thing that we do have authority over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=364.334s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And as a Councilor, knowing a bit about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=367.375s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Our job, knowing a little bit about the school committee members job though of course, not with that level of granular detail, but knowing how hard our school committee members work as all public servants do in our various roles that are, you know, hard to compare but all contribute to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=384.582s">[Kit Collins]</a>: necessary work of the public sphere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=387.406s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Contemplating an increase for school committee members is something that, you know, I've gone on record and say I think that these jobs are equivalent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=394.695s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'd like for us to consider, you know, leveling pay between these two legislative bodies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=401.383s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I'm just, I'm excited to hear the perspectives of my fellow Councilors now that we've all had a few weeks to digest this and to think about the amendments that President Morell and former Councilor Knight made during our first meeting on the topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=413.006s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I do have some proposals to bring to our discussion tonight, but I'll hold those until we hear from, you know, some of my fellow Councilors and others in the space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=421.128s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2466.7s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2467.68s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate hearing from my fellow councilors about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2474.991s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A lot to respond to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2475.932s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I already started out my comments with where I'm coming from in my overall approach to this issue, so I'll do my best not to reiterate myself because I don't want to bore you all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2487.057s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm going to make a couple of proposals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2490.599s">[Kit Collins]</a>: First, I do just want to, I do feel like it's important to emphasize this isn't about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2499.226s">[Kit Collins]</a>: feel like this shouldn't be a controversial statement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2501.008s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This isn't about this school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2502.769s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is about the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2504.731s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Whoever is on it, any changes that we pass will be in effect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2510.43s">[Kit Collins]</a>: into the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2511.951s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What, speaking only for myself, what we'll be voting on, I would vote on regardless of who was in those chairs, because I think that, and it was mentioned also tonight, compensation, the need to, sometimes it comes up, we discuss how should volunteers be compensated?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2526.576s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Should we compensate volunteers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2528.416s">[Kit Collins]</a>: How should boards and commissions be compensated?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2530.157s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have been a little bit obnoxious in saying whenever it comes up, I believe that we should compensate members of all boards and commissions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2536.379s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just bring that up to say, I think it's,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2539.974s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's really understandable that these conversations get personal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2542.619s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For me, this is not personal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2543.6s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is about how I think this body should be compensated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2551.514s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Moving on from that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2554.729s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate Councilor Tseng's motion to raise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2560.872s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It wasn't a formal motion, a bit of a hint of motion, pre-motion perhaps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2565.634s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate Councilor Tseng's idea around raising school committee compensation to follow the same year over year percentage increases that have occurred in the MTA contract from the numbers that we received, which would arrive at that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2583.746s">[Kit Collins]</a>: $22,105.60 number in the year 2025.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2593.021s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If you make that in the form of the motion, I am happy to support that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2596.923s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I like that for a couple of reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2598.863s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One, I've made it clear I'd like to support a proposal for a school committee compensation increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2605.346s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've been clear about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2607.347s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think anything that we do at this point, I think it makes a lot of sense for it to be not effective immediately, but go into effect at the start of the next fiscal year and be phased in in accordance with the start of future fiscal years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2619.761s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If you make that in the form of the motion, I will support that tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2622.904s">[Kit Collins]</a>: However, I have also been clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2626.227s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are a legislative body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2627.688s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We make policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2628.509s">[Kit Collins]</a>: School committee is a legislative body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2631.171s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They make policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2632.232s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't feel comfortable as one Councilor Tseng that I know our job to be more substantial or more work than theirs because I frankly haven't seen evidence of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2641.724s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I would also like to make the proposal in the form of a motion that school committee compensation be raised over the period of four years to be leveled to city council pay, July 1, 2024 through July 1, 2027, first two years meeting parity with that MTA contract line number, and then closing the gap in 2026 and 2027.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3369.457s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3370.859s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for your deference, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3375.704s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we have two proposals before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3378.808s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And again, I say this a lot, appreciate my fellow councilors comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3381.871s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a sticky subject.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3384.955s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate the conversation that we're able to have about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3388.323s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know I've already put forth a proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3391.624s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Tseng has put forth another one that I also support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3395.386s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't know which of these will advance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3398.186s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Coming into this meeting, I know what I want to see is some increase for school committee members, and I would also like to see us create some sort of mechanism for regularly evaluating and updating and increasing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3413.135s">[Kit Collins]</a>: school committee compensation and that of all elected officials in a regularized way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3418.879s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Maybe it's an automatic COLA increase, but I think one of the things that has made this conversation very difficult is that talking about school committee pay at all is an entirely discretionary conversation for the city council to bring up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3436.381s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so it's been 23 years since we have, since I think it's been very murky, who controls that and why and how does it get brought up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3442.926s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that that's just been a disservice to the conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3447.79s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All that to say, I don't know which of, if either of the two proposals that have currently been proposed will go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3454.675s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'd like to propose a third towards that goal of setting some sort of creating some kind of mechanism for us to revisit this more than once every 23 years when everybody thinks of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3465.743s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The motion would be for this council to refer this paper to the governance committee for consideration during charter review with the goal of creating a mechanism within the updated city charter to trigger automatic COLA increases and or compensation review for all elected positions at regular interviews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3487.482s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I can forward that language to you, Mr. Clerk, if you like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3492.403s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just to reiterate, the goal here is to come out of this with some sort of mechanism for looking at elected compensation so that it doesn't fall by the wayside for 23 years, because I think that that is one of the ingredients in this scenario when we haven't talked about it in a couple decades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3507.796s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so when we do, one of the things we contemplate is a triple digit percentage increase because it's just been so long since we talked about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3517.998s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, that's my motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8109.933s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8110.833s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate you putting this into a visual format on the fly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8114.617s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think at this point in the discussion, we've all spoken and heard and listened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8123.745s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's a couple ideas out on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8127.773s">[Kit Collins]</a>: personally, I think it's time to move the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8130.755s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that in the intervening days between this goes on, the regular meeting agenda will pay time for us to reflect and absorb what we've discussed together, what we've heard from the public, and to think about path forward that makes sense now that we have some alternative proposals for us to vote on providing different ways forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8155.686s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry for my halting language, I'm like a nurse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8159.595s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to again reiterate, you know, I'll probably say this the next time this comes up as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8167.73s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do what I have the jurisdiction to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8169.371s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, last year, a couple times, we were given the opportunity to vote on cost of living adjustment increases to non-union personnel while there were still unions being negotiated, while there were still union contracts being negotiated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8182.516s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that was a discussion, which makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8183.937s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm glad that it was, and it was brought up for an understandable reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8188.318s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I voted yes, because when I have the opportunity to vote yes on a raise, I'll vote yes on a raise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8193.699s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I intend to do that here, depending on what my fellow Councilors support and what we decide that the best path forward is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8200.841s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If we had the jurisdiction to vote on raises for teachers and paras and custodians and other public servants, I would do that, but I don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8209.823s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll vote for the raises that I have the opportunity to support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8214.644s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, and I just want to note also for folks here and folks watching, um, you know, if there are people here who don't usually attend our meetings, which, you know, I know sometimes people come to some meetings and others, it's super normal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8227.639s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, this is a really unusual topic for a city council meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8232.176s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We, a lot of issues were brought up that are more of what we talked about all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8237.46s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They can store fronts, the need for commercial development the need for business development, the need to reevaluate our zoning and our housing, and all the other things that are really what we interface with as residents on a day to day basis that is the bread and butter of the city council, and that all directly feeds into.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8254.671s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the bottom line budget that affects how much we can appropriate to the schools for the schools to then appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8260.034s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Once it enters the schools, we don't touch it, except for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8264.517s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I just also want to, while reemphasizing the validity of everything that's been said today, I believe that that work that takes up most of our time on this council exceeds by magnitudes in terms of what we can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8280.902s">[Kit Collins]</a>: do in terms of revenue and support that feeds into necessary services in the schools and elsewhere throughout this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8288.516s">[Kit Collins]</a>: it is more impactful than what will be at maximum, a 0.05% increase over as much as four years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8296.199s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I don't say that to minimize the issue, the values behind the discussion are really important, but just to frame it in the larger discussion of what this council is trying to do all year long during budget season, creating more mechanisms and ordinances to bring more clarity and reality and long-term planning to our budget process, working on our commercial tax base through zoning and licensing and business development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8318.448s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That is all part and parcel of this work, and it is, in terms of dollars, more impactful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8328.791s">[Kit Collins]</a>: With that, I would move the question to vote on these proposals tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8332.332s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=71.327s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I nominate Councilor Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=805.669s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I see the role of vice president as being the person who<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=817.617s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this is a body that strives to be professional and effective, proactive, and prolific at doing our duty, which is to pass policies that make life better in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=829.946s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I look forward to working with President Bears to set the conditions to make us all individually and collectively do that work as effectively as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=840.925s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and to have a term together that we can feel proud of and be accountable to the people that put us in these chairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1127.063s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is to ensure that all papers that haven't been<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1130.424s">[Kit Collins]</a>: dispensed with in one form or another from the previous term to remain live in this session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4437.029s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Whereas many cities and countries prohibited evictions between November 1 and March 31 due to winter cold that puts lives in danger and whereas Massachusetts has yet to implement a statewide policy to protect families from becoming unhoused<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4451.4s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and put out on the street in dangerously cold weather, and whereas over 1,200 households were evicted in Massachusetts in the winter of 2022 through 2023.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4461.926s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we request that the Board of Health declare an annual state of emergency and implement an eviction moratorium each winter to protect the health and safety of residents who face potentially fatal illness if evicted during the winter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4477.515s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5148.933s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5194.675s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5197.662s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the good landlord tax credit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5199.703s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is kind of the colloquial phrase for a local option that was included very recently in the state tax relief package under Governor Healey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5210.987s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Essentially, this provides now a new way for cities to give a property tax break to landlords who choose to keep their rents below market rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5221.871s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So it is a way to, in different framings, either incentivize or reward or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5227.432s">[Kit Collins]</a>: thank, if you want to put it that way, small landlords who opt to offer more affordable rents to their tenants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5235.56s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's not a one-size-fits-all mechanism.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5237.562s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Cities can have several levers that they can pull on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5244.209s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They can choose<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5252.003s">[Kit Collins]</a>: up to what percentage of property tax to exempt landlords from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5259.072s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They can choose whether to enact this option for landlords who, oh, I always get this wording messed up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5271.55s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You can enact this if rents are affordable up to 200% AMI.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5275.214s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have the option to narrow it so that it's just for landlords who provide only much deeper affordability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5281.562s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's like a whole spectrum that this council could investigate and decide what might be the best fit for this community, and all communities have that option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5291.513s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So there's a lot to deliberate on to explore this option further and decide what might be the best fit for Medford, for our landlords that are offering low market rate rents, all towards the goal of incentivizing small landlords to do this, because we have such an acute and ever-worsening affordable housing scarcity and crisis in Medford, as we do throughout the region, and as a way to make making that choice to offer affordability<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5320.276s">[Kit Collins]</a>: a little more doable for landlords and to further incentivize them to do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5326.063s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so my motion is to send this to the administration and finance committee where we can have a start discussion about it with our chief assessor and our finance director about implications for the city and get their insight on how to implement this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5812.51s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, now that we have approved the resolution to adopt committees with titles, I should just amend this to refer to the Administration and Finance Committee and not committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=8324.106s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just by way of quick recap for the new Councilors in the room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=8328.951s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Again, this is an update to the existing Chapter 70, which governs solid waste in Medford, how we deal with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=8336.96s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The updates align our current ordinance with best practices promulgated by MassDEP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=8344.148s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We worked closely with the Planning Development Sustainability Office and the DPW Commissioner to make sure that this would align with what we are looking to do to hold the waste haulers in our community more accountable to our goals for having this be a smooth and efficient process for residents and businesses, as well as getting us closer to our waste reduction goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=8407.207s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=794.81s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=797.131s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=798.132s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for being before us again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=799.733s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We always appreciate you keeping us updated meeting after meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=804.188s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would second the motion to table this to a date certain, and I certainly appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=807.611s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know you've put time into keeping us briefed on where negotiations and putting together the agreement is at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=813.896s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think you've done a wonderful job of putting the project into scope pretty efficiently for us in the past, and it's my hope that if we meet on this at our first or second regular meeting in January with those final details ironed out, hopefully we can approve this and dispense with it and get you and the offices on to the next step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1257.425s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell, and I appreciate you bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1259.927s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Vice President Bears, we've spoken at length already in previous council meetings about the original reasons for bringing forward the request for an election postmortem and report, the errors and mishandlings that happened on election day, which again, were addressed, which should not have happened, and we need to know exactly how they won't happen again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1284.144s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then the issues and mishandlings that happened leading up to the recount and needing a full accounting of why those happened and how exactly we'll know they won't happen again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1294.989s">[Kit Collins]</a>: To me, this is on the institutional scale, an example of people don't plan to fail, they fail to plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1306.374s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've discussed how going into this election,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1309.147s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There were serious concerns about the capacity of the elections department because its staffing had dropped so low below its previous levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1319.554s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think we really need to see, we need to see the diagnostic of what exactly happened and why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1324.597s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we need to investigate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1326.411s">[Kit Collins]</a>: First, the Elections Commission, the Elections Department, and then as a community, as a council, we need to investigate what needs to happen so that we can go into our three very consequential elections in 2024 with the Elections Office and the Elections Commission feeling professional and organized and competent so that every voter and every resident in Medford can feel confident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1346.89s">[Kit Collins]</a>: about the three, again, very consequential elections that we will have in 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1351.512s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I do think it bears emphasizing that by the time that we hear back from the Elections Commission at our January meeting, it will be less than two months until the first of those three elections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1364.636s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think everybody shares a sense of disappointment that it's necessary to have this conversation at all, that it's necessary to put a deadline on it because we haven't gotten a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1376.004s">[Kit Collins]</a>: really any response so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1379.326s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But if it takes imposing accountability at the outset until this commission and the department can be imposing accountability from within, it's non-negotiable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=1389.792s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2843.852s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2846.906s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2848.167s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate you asking the question in a public forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2851.629s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My impression is that nothing is certain here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2855.371s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We got this heads up that Councilor Scarpelli, thank you for sharing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2859.073s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My impression from receiving that same communication a couple weeks ago is that this is still in flux and the mayor is still<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2867.375s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in conversation with state partners who is in conversation with this landlord to determine when the state picks a site, will it be this one or will it be another one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2876.738s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think in this case, no news really is no news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2881.579s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I just don't want us to get ahead of ourselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2883.679s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's also, and again, I think if this were to go forward, we should get solid answers from the people who really know for sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2891.241s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think the conception of this temporary shelter is not to be a months long<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2897.664s">[Kit Collins]</a>: for any of these migrant families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2899.145s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's more like away station families would stay for a couple of nights, so I don't think it's in any way certain that this would cause a burden on our public school system because we're not going to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2932.301s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2932.761s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And yeah, I think it's certainly, certainly be great to circle back with the executive office to ask the question of what's the status?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2938.826s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is this going forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2939.767s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I interpreted that email as not, we're extending this so that families, any given family will stay through June, but rather this will remain a way station for two or three nights at a time, just for a couple more months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2951.237s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So certainly appreciate all the questions asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2954.119s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My assumption is that this is just certainly still up in the air as many, you know, large infrastructural, you know, sure social infrastructural or if I could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2961.61s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also think that, you know, certainly asking for an update I'm sure that, you know, trying to sort this out at the end of the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2972.11s">[Kit Collins]</a>: but sort of recentering on the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2974.572s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We know that we have a shelter crisis in Massachusetts at this time of year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=2978.636s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If this is an opportunity where marshaling state resources, Medford can be a port in the storm for vulnerable migrant families, I think that's another important safety piece to put into the conversation is the lack of safety that's putting these families into the situation to begin with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3618.604s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Garabiello, it's been an honor to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3625.982s">[Kit Collins]</a>: serve alongside you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3629.103s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Nobody knows I have the best seat in the chambers because Rick has the best gossip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3636.124s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You've always offered me advice, unsolicited advice that's been true every time, solicited advice that's been very useful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3647.435s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, I know that you care about the success of this community, and you care about the success of this city, and you care about the success of this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3655.06s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No matter who's behind the rail, you want us to be doing the best work that we can for the benefit of the people that live here, and that's evident in everything that you do and how you spend your time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3663.344s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you for your partnership with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3666.626s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for working with me in good faith every week over the past two years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3670.469s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for your service for so many years, and excited to see what you do next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3676.481s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6154.738s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6158.421s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Knight, we're sorry to see you go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6160.282s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You leave big shoes to fill on this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6164.206s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know a lot of people have remarked upon it, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6166.499s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Your depth of institutional knowledge has been such an asset to this council in the two years that I've been involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6171.98s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're going to need somebody to step up and learn every line of parliamentary procedure to save us from those future kind of borderline situations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6180.381s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we're like, oh, is that a simple or a super majority?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6183.322s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Because we always counted on you to know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6186.182s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But in all seriousness, I think that your respect and your affection for the city is spelled in the rigor that you've always brought to this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6195.071s">[Kit Collins]</a>: role, you have a razor-sharp sense of right and wrong, you don't suffer fools gladly, and I think that there's been many topics that we've discussed on the council, many papers that we've deliberated where that has been an asset to the outcomes because we've always been focused on making sure that the city is headed in the right direction and that the council is doing the right thing, that the council is doing its job as you see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6220.462s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's always been very clear and I as one council have always appreciated it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6225.247s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Best of luck to you and your family and everything that lies before you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6227.868s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for your service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6229.368s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6969.331s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Maybe this will be one of the last very long list of unenviable tasks in your tenure as president of the City Council is calling on people to then speak about you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6981.18s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well, Nicole, it's hard to know where to start in congratulating you on your two terms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6987.145s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Surely this must be one of the densest tenures of any Medford City Councilor to serve two years during a pandemic and then two as president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6997.754s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's pretty remarkable what you've been able to accomplish in your two terms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7002.778s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think, you know, a phrase that I heard from you that I learned from you is occupying spaces that weren't designed for people like you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7010.624s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think often about how you were running for city council two years before I did in completely certain terms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7022.503s">[Kit Collins]</a>: gave the way for myself and people like me to think about engaging in civic life in ways that are not traditional, that never felt possible or likely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7031.835s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's a gift that you gave to not just myself for this opportunity, but for the community of Medford for allowing, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7040.828s">[Kit Collins]</a>: representation to blossom and become better and become more representative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7046.353s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And as that continues to expand and to blossom over time, you will have been a crucial ingredient in that for future generations of Medford City Councils.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7059.364s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it deserves repeating that you've presided over a really effective, a really civil,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7067.597s">[Kit Collins]</a>: a friendlier Council than has always been true and I think that's a real benefit to the effectiveness of this Council I think that's a benefit to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7075.26s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that it makes City Hall more welcoming and inclusive space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7079.681s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's just so important and that will continue after you as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7087.083s">[Kit Collins]</a>: so many projects that I hope that you can really feel the gravity of as you leave office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7092.608s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You were pushing for our zoning overhaul for two years before I was ever elected, and that's going to be a defining feature of the term ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7102.637s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In so many ways, you've teed us up for, you've teed up the future council, perhaps the council after that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7109.083s">[Kit Collins]</a>: for success with the projects that you've advocated for, that you've worked for, with the relationships that you've cultivated with members of, with City Hall staff, and with the new and better expectations that we have come to set for this City Council and that residents and staff have come to set for this City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7126.997s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So my hope for you is that you feel as positive and as proud about your tenure<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7134.662s">[Kit Collins]</a>: on city council as everybody else does, because it's a gift to leave us in such a position to be so much more effective and inclusive in our future work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7148.781s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7150.363s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for the sacrifices that you've made to be here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7153.587s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know that your life after city council will continue to be extremely full and busy doing incredible work on MIT campus, as well as taking care of the cutest two-year-old in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7166.113s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I, too, hope that we can lure you back in in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7169.994s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Nicole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R05RUR--lkc&t=129.548s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would nominate Councilor Bears for President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R05RUR--lkc&t=206.798s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Bears?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R05RUR--lkc&t=208.179s">[Kit Collins]</a>: He stays full name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R05RUR--lkc&t=209.12s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R05RUR--lkc&t=210.609s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Isaac B. Zach-Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R05RUR--lkc&t=212.95s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm not going to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R05RUR--lkc&t=214.831s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Stephanie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R05RUR--lkc&t=373.371s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Even though this is the non-binding vote, we'll do this again in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R05RUR--lkc&t=376.793s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to thank my co-workers and future co-workers for their support and I look forward to supporting the work of the council over the coming year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R05RUR--lkc&t=384.256s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1916.118s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1916.998s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell, sorry, to the chair you're sitting in, for introducing this paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1923.142s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I thank you to everybody who's reached out over the past several days and took the time to be here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1927.284s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to acknowledge, I know that there's a lot of engagement around this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1931.446s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know there's a lot of strong feelings about this proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1933.527s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I just, before I state my own thoughts, I just want to acknowledge that and thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1937.869s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for engaging in this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1941.09s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As Councilor Bears said, this is a process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1942.871s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is the initial introduction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1944.738s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is what this process looks like coming up and sharing opinions and working through things together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1948.68s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1952.081s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Want to use my time to explain my support for looking into this proposal, my support for achieving pay equity between the city council and school committee, my view on what this proposal is and what it isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1965.956s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do not believe that this is in any way incompatible with what I think has been a core and shared goal of the City Council, at least in the one term that I've been a part of it, which is supporting all of our public school employees, supporting Medford Public Schools, and trying to ever improve the conditions of everybody that touches our public school systems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1985.408s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The students, their families, the teachers, the paras.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1989.232s">[Kit Collins]</a>: all of the workers in our schools that help students and students' families thrive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1995.2s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do not believe that this proposal is incompatible with that shared goal whatsoever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2000.287s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2004.056s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the equity between the school committee and the city council is something that I've wanted to, that I've hoped to have the opportunity to vote on ever since I first took office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2012.458s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These are two elected bodies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2014.118s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know how hard we work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2016.018s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have some glimmer of perspective of how hard the school committee works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2020.299s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They have responsibilities that we don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2022.14s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it is outdated that our bodies are paid differently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2026.06s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That is the core reason for my support for this proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2030.181s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And even if it were to stop right there, that would be enough for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2034.802s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I see that this draws in a larger conversation about what we can and can't do in Medford, what we have and haven't done in Medford so far, especially every June during budget cycle and really all year round.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2046.427s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If you watch the city council meetings, if you watch the school committee meetings, we are constantly talking about the resources that are afforded to Medford public schools, the people that work in them and everybody that experiences the work that is done in those buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2058.953s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we are constantly in this conversation about why aren't we doing better and how can we continue to do better<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2064.659s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to better value and better resource what goes on in the schools, and better value and better resource the people that do the work of the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2072.785s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This proposal, I think, has brought up those values and those feelings and that imperative that we have to keep doing better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2081.252s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What I don't believe is that this is an either-or, and what I don't believe is that this is a zero-sum game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2087.797s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that if this proposal were to go forward even as written before amendments,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2094.221s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is not, this would not take from the same bucket of money that would otherwise go to the workers that contribute to MPS students experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2103.888s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Hang on, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2108.471s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, thank you for letting me speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2112.915s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This year, we found out that we had a 25 million sum of certified free cash, $25 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2124.67s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When we talk about what we can and can't do in Medford and what we have and haven't done, I think that we need to stay, I try to stay, laser focused on what our real opponent is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2138.082s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Our real opponent is austerity budgeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2141.024s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I believe that we have the money to value the people who choose to nominate themselves for school committee and go through the process of running and seek election and serve in that role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2152.674s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that we have the resources, that we can marshal the resources to do better by everybody who contributes to the Medford public school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2160.017s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We talk about it all year long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2162.538s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We talk about how little authority the school committee, sorry, we talk about where the city council's authority lies and doesn't lie when it comes to making direct appropriations to our budgets, including the school budgets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2172.383s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We talk about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2173.823s">[Kit Collins]</a>: all the time, often in great frustration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2176.064s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We don't have the power to influence bargaining units here in the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2179.846s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We don't have the authority to make appropriations whatsoever that is out of our purview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2185.228s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know, speaking for myself, there's been countless times when I wished it was in our purview, because I'm so frustrated by what I see in the line items in the budgets that we have to vote yes or no on, because that's all that we can do on those budgets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2197.734s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So when it comes back to this proposal,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2199.662s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Due to the constraints of our jurisdiction here, this is something that we are legally allowed to vote on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2206.587s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And there are many things that we will never have the opportunity to vote on, because that is not within our purview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2212.072s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When something comes in front of me that is an opportunity to discuss and interrogate, is this an opportunity to do a good thing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2218.637s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to take that opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2221.219s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I do not think it is in any way incompatible with continuing to do better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2225.834s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in the many areas, the many school-related areas where we need to keep doing better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2230.057s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's not a zero-sum, and it's not an either-or.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2232.239s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I look forward to hearing the discussion tonight, and I look forward to continuing to hold ourselves accountable to do this right, and to do right by all of our public employees, and to do as many things right as we can, all at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2246.43s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I don't think that we have to choose between one or the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2248.812s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8318.934s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8319.454s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8320.756s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There was a lot of, it feels cheap to say, there was a lot of really important perspectives shared tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8327.884s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I feel like even just saying that doesn't really do it justice, but I wanted to leave the last word to a lead sponsor of the paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8336.091s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I did just wanted to quickly clarify one of my previous comments, because I think when I mentioned the free cash number, I was unclear, and I apologize for speaking unclearly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8344.356s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was nervous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8345.916s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What I really meant to say was to try to recenter my comments on what I think is the most important part of most of the conversations that we have in the city council, which is that tight budgets are a choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8358.663s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And they're not a choice that we make in this branch of government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8365.061s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I hope that a silver lining of this conversation can be elucidating for this body and for the school committee and for the residents, how our budgets get made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8374.443s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's an ongoing process of making the budget every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8377.223s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And for us, it just means approving it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8379.043s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We cannot appropriate, we cannot weigh in on collective bargaining.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8382.584s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We cannot move money from one salary to another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8386.305s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're sorely limited in what we can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8389.305s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I hope that this ongoing process allows us to have the conversation with the community<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8394.005s">[Kit Collins]</a>: how our budgets are shaped, and who shapes them, and what limited power lies where, because I think it's beneficial for the community to get a better sense of how that pie gets baked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8403.61s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think what makes me frustrated, what I hear in this room tonight, is that we, the administration, willfully keeps urgently needed funding away from the people and services that need it, year after year, on a scale that exceeds by magnitude the scale of these proposed COLA increases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8423.098s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that is what I'll be focusing on as we continue to discuss this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8426.62s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I hope that we can continue to center the conversation around this conversation and achieving equity and just what we need in our operating budget year after year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8438.427s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I thank you to everybody who brought that to this conversation tonight and will in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8442.51s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=10599.223s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just want to say, excuse me, thank you for bringing your concerns to us tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=10606.43s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Glad to hear that we have some action steps we can quickly take on the construction infractions piece of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=10613.875s">[Kit Collins]</a>: really appreciate you speaking to, especially appreciate you actually reading the housing production plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=10620.338s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well, I think that's probably the average way to read it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=10624.159s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think that your comments resonate with a lot of the work that we've laid out for ourselves on the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=10630.002s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've been trying to work on this term and we have a lot more ahead coming up over the next two years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=10635.224s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that aligning the goals of the housing production plan in terms of making sure that the development we're building is not exclusively or heavily weighted to luxury development,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=10643.846s">[Kit Collins]</a>: serving a wide range of users and households is deeply embedded in the work that we're trying to do through our zoning overhaul which we're very much gearing up for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=10651.754s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have a condo conversion ordinance that's still in progress so there are some, there's some ongoing council projects that touch on exactly what you're speaking so just encourage you to, you know, we'd love to, you know, have you be engaged in the public process and those as they unfold and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=10667.21s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These are projects that have come about because of what the community has said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=10669.692s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We want housing to look like and not look like in Medford, so we welcome your continuing participation in the high-level policy that we try to implement to make sure that we don't just turn into a community of luxury condos where nobody can afford to live in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12023.256s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12024.499s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll echo that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12026.633s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm excited to vote on this tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12028.313s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate your office and the consultant making yourself so available throughout this entire process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12033.175s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And to echo what President Morell said, if there's a lack of deep questions and comments tonight, it's because we've had so many opportunities for that in recent months and weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12041.757s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that the recommendations that came out of the CD board, they affirm what's distinctive and significant about this district, its transit proximity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12053.059s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Had some really interesting conversations with your department about making sure that this is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12056.6s">[Kit Collins]</a>: dialed in to have the right incentives for like really what we're trying to promote in this district, excited to see what comes out of this and you know for residents who are, you know, further curious about what this means for Wellington and in the greater context of, you know, development and rezoning and Medford, you know, as we talked about the last time<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12074.679s">[Kit Collins]</a>: a couple weeks ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12076.299s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We still have the opportunity to look at the underlying zoning in the course of our already planned zoning overhaul beginning next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12084.721s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we'll continue to talk about Wellington and the conversation of comprehensive rezoning for Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12091.723s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But for today, excited to hit the deadline on this for state compliance and excited to make sure that this works in concert with the rest of our zoning for Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12100.684s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12363.902s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Roehl.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12366.104s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this is a project that we've been working on in subcommittee since March.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12372.39s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The real seeds of this project were in the Solid Waste Task Force that met for a lot of 2022 under the direction of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12380.503s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Director Hahn and consultants towards the goal of looking at tools available to us to start our next waste hauling contract with best possible deal for the city both in terms of cost effectiveness and in terms of progressing towards our zero waste goals which of course is integral to our overarching sustainability goals and one of the things that came out of that conversation not just recommendations for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12404.514s">[Kit Collins]</a>: our next waste hauling contract was actually to tweak the existing Medford legislation around solid waste in Medford to make sure that we had the legislative foundation to make sure that we could hold our future waste hauler vendor to account in accordance with our sustainability goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12424.065s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So in the Subcommittee on Ordinances and Rules, we worked closely with Director Hunt and her department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12432.93s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There are a couple<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12434.179s">[Kit Collins]</a>: main changes that we made, but overall we just took our existing waste hauling ordinance, which was pretty outdated in a lot of ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12442.144s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we made sure that it was updated to align with best practices coming out of the MAS DEP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12448.308s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And the origins of this document start with their template language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12451.249s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So it's been thoroughly vetted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12452.35s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This aligns with what other communities do in terms of waste hauling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12457.881s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One of the most consequential changes is that there's now a bundled service requirement, which essentially just says, if you offer trash pickup in Medford, you have to also offer recycling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12466.849s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And this is significant, because that way, vendors that only offer trash pickup cannot undercut vendors that offer both on price.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12474.496s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And this will allow us to recycle the most in Medford in the most cost-effective way, which affects people on the city contract as well as everybody else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12485.327s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's the main strokes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12486.327s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We did work with Director O'Connor from the Board of Health to make sure that this document aligns with current Board of Health regulations for waste haulers because they do, they operate the permitting side to make sure that everything is consistent to make this legible and understandable for generators as well as vendors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12503.093s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do have a few last amendments that I'll make from the floor just on the definitions in article one after any further comment or questions from my fellow Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12540.597s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12578.561s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Amendments?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12579.702s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12581.183s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And thank you so much for your comments, and to everybody who worked on this with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12586.308s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just quickly, just some quick amendments for Article 1 in general.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12596.731s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This was the last piece that we didn't amend in subcommittee, but I have some amendments that were run past a whole host of department heads, and I have a list if people are interested in seeing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12609.797s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We just wanted to take section 71, 72, sorry, 70-1, 70-2, and 70-3, put those into contemporary language and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12620.76s">[Kit Collins]</a>: make sure that everybody who ought to be, every department that ought to be mentioned in those sections so that they could be tasked with enforcement would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12630.951s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I can read off those amendments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12633.654s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They're just a short paragraph each, and I'll also email that language to the city clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12640.861s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes, I'll email it to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12642.799s">[Kit Collins]</a>: have the draft queued up but I didn't send it unless there was any controversy about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12656.914s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Who will speak for the cinders?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12674.731s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well, I don't know who speaks for the cows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12679.638s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So for Section 70-1, the motion would be to strike the existing and replace with, you should have this in your email inbox,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12687.231s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No private property may become a gathering place for debris, refuse, discarded, or abandoned items or other waste.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12693.073s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any property owner who has received written notice from the Department of Public Works, Medford Police Department, Code Enforcement Officer, or Medford Board of Health to remove any such material from their property must do so within the timeframe directed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12706.764s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Second is to take the existing section 70-2 and strike that and replace it with no debris, refuse, discarded items, or other waste, including yard waste and construction debris may be placed or dumped in any public place or public way in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12720.134s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All waste must be properly contained and properly placed for collection on scheduled collection days in accordance with the regulations, schedules, and policies promulgated by the Department of Public Works and Board of Health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12729.602s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any person who has been ordered by the Department of Public Works, Medford Police Department, code enforcement officer, Medford Board of Health, or designee thereof<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12737.051s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to remove any improperly discarded material or waste from private or public property must do so within the time frame directed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12744.433s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then finally, to just strike 70-3 because that information has been subsumed into the proposed 70-1 and 70-2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=12752.916s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=15.0s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=368.713s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Merlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=369.674s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Director Hunt for helping prepare these RFP responses for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=375.619s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Having looked at both proposals, I echo comments from my<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=378.888s">[Kit Collins]</a>: fellow Councilors, it's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=380.349s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It would have been great to get back 15 excellent responses, but I'm glad that we got back two excellent responses to compare and look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=388.634s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I, you know, I think it's hard to say no to working with a really experienced, really qualified consultant that knows both our community really well from working here recently, especially on the kind of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=402.779s">[Kit Collins]</a>: well, comprehensive projects that we've hired them for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=408.221s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's hard to say no to that kind of springboard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=410.622s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They've already put their arms around the community as a whole through the comprehensive plan and other projects with your department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=416.864s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm also very encouraged by the work that they've done with other communities around Massachusetts and communities that share various characteristics with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=428.449s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=430.578s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That strikes me as very encouraging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=431.898s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I see that they've worked comprehensively with the communities, I see that they've worked with the communities on kind of more targeted specific projects, whether it's kind of a gateway cities approach, a creative district, the MBTA Communities Act, and they also have the comprehensive experience with the communities as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=447.463s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that seems like a really good fit to me, because I think that our voting overhaul will require<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=456.067s">[Kit Collins]</a>: both that bird's eye view approach and also the, you know, I think we have areas of the city where we want to take a really specific lens and say we're trying to do this here in accordance with part of what's, some of the goals that's been laid out through our various plans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=470.57s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, looking through Fisher's portfolio projects, it's really compelling as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=477.292s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that they have deep experience in their region that they've done a lot of work in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=484.4s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The Innis proposal shows a real depth of experience in communities that share some characteristics to ours around Massachusetts, and I find that especially compelling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=494.467s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=22.606s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2722.236s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Not a question, but I just wanted to thank you, pardon me, again for speaking to us about this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2728.001s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know it, I think it speaks to the need for, you know, I know it's an ever-evolving project too, because protocols around private ways have been shifting for such a long time and there's been kind of a systemic lack of clarity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2741.712s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's not totally surprising that this comes up every six months or 12 months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2746.356s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's good that we're talking about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2749.835s">[Kit Collins]</a>: options for getting the word out to more residents within our capacity, like a mailing or, I mean, even just, I agree, even a really simple webpage, I think, would help folks in our position who, you know, kind of have to dole out information about private ways to residents when it comes up multiple times a year to try to, you know, over the long term, get more people on the same page throughout the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2774.846s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So it's great to have a conversation about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2776.507s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that we're going to try to move the needle on that as we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2781.358s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and I think it's to everybody's benefit, you know, to just be reminded of what we're working against here and the responsibilities that we have that govern that public funds overall and how unfortunately incredibly expensive it is to do what we really want to do, which is to, you know, have that full jurisdiction over all of the roads that all residents live on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2803.477s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's just helpful to get sobering as it may be, you know, and reminders of what a big task that is for the city to do comprehensively and what we need to do in interim steps to try to improve resident enjoyment and, you know, equal enjoyment of residential roads in the meantime as we try to keep our eye on the prize for what will it take to, you know, fully adopt private ways over the long term and what are the reasons for doing that and what can people do in the meantime.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2833.284s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate this conversation and for me it's helpful for communicating that to residents and I hope that it's helpful in our ongoing efforts to let residents know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=3027.407s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have a motion to receive and place on file and adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1175.302s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, really appreciate the work of the planning staff that went into this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1180.164s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know there's been a lot of back and forth with the state, so thank you for staying on it for many months to make sure that we can be in compliance and really appreciate the presentation as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1190.108s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Emily, thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1191.549s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was hoping, could you speak a bit more about the maximum height with incentives piece, how that works, how those triggers kick in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1200.032s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's not feeling super intuitive to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1202.533s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If you could walk us through that, I'd really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=64.182s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=65.623s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=116.455s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=119.237s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2186.384s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell, and I appreciate the councilors who brought this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2189.585s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to affirm what all of my colleagues have said so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2194.146s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It shouldn't need to be restated that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2197.489s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Our constituency deserves an elections office that is fully equipped at any time to defend full and fair access for every single voter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2206.836s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Individual staff members and volunteers and elected should not be having to fill the gaps or notice gaps or individually lobby or push staff members to do the right thing and correct issues at the 11th hour on election day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2219.425s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But this was the case last Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2221.266s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That was my experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2222.767s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's alarming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2224.515s">[Kit Collins]</a>: for anybody who works with City Hall in any capacity as an elected, as an appointed, or as a volunteer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2230.02s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That should never be an option, let alone be necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2234.184s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we all agree if even one voter is unable to cast their ballot because of incorrect mail ballot return information or unable to cast their ballot because they were<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2247.612s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, aspersions were cast about, can I bring my voter guide into the ballot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2251.296s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Or even if that concern is arisen, that concern isn't supposed to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2254.979s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's why we have voter rights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2256.06s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's why they're extremely important in this city, throughout the Commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2260.905s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If we are condoning those issues in our elections office, even for one voter, then we've failed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2266.45s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that's how high of a bar that we have to have for elections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2270.271s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As Councilor Scarpelli and others mentioned, we're in an age where, unfortunately, people are out looking for reasons to cast aspersions on the voting process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2278.233s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We cannot continue to open the city up to this kind of liability, and it's extremely frustrating because the City Council has brought up this issue before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2289.896s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've tried to prevent this issue from happening before it happened for a second time, and it did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2297.291s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we are saying now, as a council, we can't condone a disorganized and inconsistent voting experience, or even really a difficult voting experience for any voter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2306.341s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's not how it's supposed to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2308.923s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Voting isn't a privilege.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2310.185s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's a right, and it shouldn't be difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2312.007s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It should be easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2312.627s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it was difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2317.599s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate the resolution to ask the administration for appropriation to fulfill full staffing in the elections office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2325.525s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2327.167s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we saw it was necessary before this election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2330.748s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And now I think that we're again seeing the symptoms of an underfunded essential municipal service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2337.392s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that we need to see this office restored to its full capacity because this is what a lack of capacity looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2343.676s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We need to see what accountability looks like, as Councilor Tseng said, and we need to know what went wrong specifically, and we need to know what will change specifically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2353.728s">[Kit Collins]</a>: tomorrow, next week, the week after that, so that our multiple elections next year will be airtight and that every resident that has felt a lack of confidence or disenfranchised by this process can know that our next elections are multiple, very consequential elections next year will be airtight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2371.999s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I hope that the administration is listening and I hope that they will respond with the urgency that we feel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2376.802s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9245.002s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9246.123s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have some general comments, but I know a lot of commenters brought up concerns about traffic in the neighborhood, which I know is an existing concern for the neighborhood as is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9255.486s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We brought our previous meeting on this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9258.295s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We did get some more in-depth analysis of how the MHA arrived at the recommendation of 0.5 parking spaces per unit, and as I recall, at the time there was even some discussion about are we even overshooting the need based on the analysis of residents and frequent visitors and staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9275.541s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Since that was raised a lot in this meeting, I was just curious if the MHA wanted to speak to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9282.182s">[Kit Collins]</a>: While we have this platform for further discussion, just because my recollection was that this number was arrived at after rounding up rather than rounding down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9330.409s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9345.889s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If there is no further discussion from my fellow councilors, I would motion to approve pending the public comment period, if that's the appropriate motion for this public hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9393.443s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11497.576s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11498.436s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm bringing this forward after some back and forth with residents who are concerned about excessive wildlife feeding that they've been noticing in their neighborhood that they've been unable to resolve through neighbor outreach alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11512.283s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This proposal would be simply in the interest of curbing excessive or inappropriate wildlife feeding, not talking about rural bird feeders, not trying to steal anybody's joy, in residential areas in the interest of keeping homes<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11524.797s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and porches and yards free from animal traffic, food, waste, detritus, harms to peace and health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11532.563s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There are some nearby communities to ours that have passed similar ordinances just in order to enable code enforcement to intervene around this when necessary that we can look to as a jumping off point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11544.532s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I would motion to approve and send a subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11595.413s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell, and thank you to yourself and Councilor Tseng for joining with me on this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11600.913s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Transgender Day of Remembrance is observed on November 20th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11604.535s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is the day to think about and remember those who have tragically lost their lives due to hatred and bigotry and violence simply for being who they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11616.482s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it's a day to contemplate those who paved the way for others in the trans and greater LGBTQ plus community to be able to live their authentic lives and thrive in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11630.367s">[Kit Collins]</a>: against the history of hardship, enduring hardship.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11634.229s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I appreciate this opportunity to reaffirm our solidarity with the trans community and to have a moment to contemplate sacrifices and tragedies that have come before us and the work ahead to a fully equitable and safe society for all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11648.634s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11843.769s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11845.449s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This proposal was brought forward by a constituent who's been active in local efforts to ensure that commercial sales of pets and pet shops is done in a humane way, is kind of observing best practices around making sure that commercial pet stores in our communities are not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11868.694s">[Kit Collins]</a>: promoting or participating in inhumane raising and selling of pets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11874.878s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this would be an ordinance project to look at what nearby communities are doing to try to take local action to make sure that is the case and to see what might make sense to tailor for Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11886.426s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12254.046s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12255.106s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12257.288s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I famously was not in Medford for high school,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12260.197s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But, you know, I think we can all relate to having that one or two special teachers that stay with us for, you know, as students that stay with us for our entire lives, that are mentors, leave such a big impression that we never forget about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12271.219s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it's clear from what I've been hearing from friends about Mr. Lazzaro after the past few days that he was that person for just hundreds and hundreds of students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12279.421s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it's hard to imagine having a having a greater impact on your community than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12284.302s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm just thinking of his family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12285.582s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My heart goes out to them, sending my most sincere condolences and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12289.066s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It makes me wish I had known him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=14.619s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=281.079s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell for putting this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=284.263s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Everyone who knows Henry and Evelyn knows they truly have some of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=288.254s">[Kit Collins]</a>: one of the most enthusiastic, energetic households in the city of Medford, and we're all very lucky that they choose to direct so much of their energies towards positive causes, typically, and for families in Medford, and I'm just so happy to see them getting some of the recognition that they deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=306.108s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you, Henry and Evelyn, for a really lifetime of positive contributions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1084.698s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1085.658s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate, uh, Councilor bears for putting this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1089.359s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, I see this issue in action every time I try to drive to my house in South Medford from Wegmans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1096.162s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, and it's this is a citywide issue of, you know, every apartment that I've lived in in South Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1102.584s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1103.576s">[Kit Collins]</a>: one intersection that I look at 100 times a week where it seems to be a cut through street that inevitably has a daycare on that street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1109.96s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And you see the people get impatient with the main thoroughfare and they use the cut through, they speed down it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1114.583s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it's, I agree it is a citywide issue and it's horrifying to see it every time because you're just waiting for something, you know, hair raising to happen and residents shouldn't have to live with that volume of high speed cut through traffic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1127.431s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I completely agree that the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1133.433s">[Kit Collins]</a>: widespread nature of this issue throughout the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1135.414s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it shines a light on how what we really need is the resources to support citywide approach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1142.899s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think a lot of the time with these issues, we can't control for every person who would speed if they got the opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1149.163s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's hard to devise a perfect<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1151.778s">[Kit Collins]</a>: quick fix.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1152.498s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Often those aren't as those aren't the solves that we want them to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1157.581s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So in the absence of resources, you know, tomorrow to type of street redesign work that would really result in safer, appropriately speeded streets, you know, I'm hoping that our traffic and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1168.53s">[Kit Collins]</a>: transportation departments can look at Willis Avenue with haste because, you know, it's been getting, you know, this seems like it's an acute issue right now in neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1176.918s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Neighbors have been speaking up about it, and it's my hope that absent, you know, the resources for a redesign, at least the solutions that seem to be working best on Willis Avenue, when we get the chance to roll those out, we can be taking the best practices and hopefully adopting those for the other many, many problem areas across the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1193.673s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2278.728s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell, and I appreciate you sharing that update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2282.09s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also appreciate Councilor Scarpelli<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2285.234s">[Kit Collins]</a>: bringing this forward, and I appreciate your efforts to get out ahead of the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2288.856s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I have a lot of concerns about this, and one of them is making sure that we're, since this issue is known, that we're being proactive with how we're communicating about it, and letting people know that this election is going to be, you know, has been above board, will be above board, and not sowing confusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2310.069s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Because obviously,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2312.114s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think you said it very well, Councilor Scarpelli, that's the last thing that we need and it's unfortunate to have issues like this come up at this point in kind of the national mood around elections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2321.601s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so, using this platform to reassure the voters, I think is very productive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2328.186s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I reached out to the Chief of Staff after seeing the update this afternoon with some questions, really glad to hear that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2335.351s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Manager Ripley already responded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2338.733s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to shed some light on the scale of the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2343.277s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That was one of the questions I had, as well as, you know, when we say checks and balances, I think it's important for us to know exactly what those are so that we can, you know, again, be reassuring residents about, you know, exactly the how and the why of this not being an issue for election integrity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2358.711s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So it's great to know, you know, the nuts and bolts for those who don't already know about how the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2364.085s">[Kit Collins]</a>: state-assigned voter IDs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2365.766s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2366.326s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's great to know about that process so that we can all feel assured that, you know, extra ballots, if they're not disposed of before people get to City Hall, will not be counted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2376.93s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's really important to emphasize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2381.191s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So it's unfortunate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2384.352s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's important that we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2386.496s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, be transparent about the mistakes that have been made and be transparent about how exactly they're getting fixed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2391.499s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm glad that we are being properly hasty and responsible about fixing the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=2398.682s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And clearly, you know, making sure that this type of snafu does not keep happening in this office is something that I'm sure we'll all be, you know, very keen on communicating with that office about in the future, because this isn't what Medford needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JvWfg4Gsiwo&t=12.731s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JvWfg4Gsiwo&t=396.802s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JvWfg4Gsiwo&t=397.843s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'd just also like to extend my deepest condolences to Dottie's family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JvWfg4Gsiwo&t=402.165s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a sad day for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JvWfg4Gsiwo&t=404.707s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll be thinking of her and of the family in coming days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JvWfg4Gsiwo&t=407.328s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JvWfg4Gsiwo&t=501.334s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I find them in order and I move for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2698.937s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2699.857s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for the presentation tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2702.317s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's exciting to get to look through the visuals to go with the story of the development that you are developing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2712.26s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think, you know, of course, all of us behind the rail, I think that we have the same vocabulary for the known challenges on that Mystic Harbor intersection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2723.791s">[Kit Collins]</a>: pedestrian safety, traffic, of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2726.812s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sure in the course of your research, you've driven down Harvard many times and seen it for yourself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2732.334s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think what is exciting is that it's interesting to see the mock-up of the building now in the current context of this zone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2740.696s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that what is exciting is that we're at a place in the city right now where we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2746.278s">[Kit Collins]</a>: have some of these PDDs beginning to come in because we just kind of enabled this mechanism.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2750.921s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have a comprehensive plan that was passed this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2753.142s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're kind of at the very beginning of our ability to make decisions to have this be the first of many.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2760.546s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And along with that, I think comes making some modifications to the environment to, you know, change the resident experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2773.996s">[Kit Collins]</a>: as this neighborhood is changing and being zoned and being developed into, you know, I think we've had many conversations as a council about how to have this mystic corridor fulfill a lot of potential as a mixed use area with some incredible development like the type that you are developing and also have it be a real boon for residents residentially and as a place to go and enjoy the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2798.301s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's what makes me optimistic about a project like this going forward is the fact that, you know, we have some,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2804.021s">[Kit Collins]</a>: guiding frameworks for how this is a part of a whole that we've already talked through and we've talked through with our city partners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2810.242s">[Kit Collins]</a>: At the same time, I am curious, and I know that you mentioned the cooperative agreement, and I know that linkage is a part of this in whatever form it gets passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2818.825s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Because of the specific siting here, Mystic and Harvard, it's already a really difficult area to be a pedestrian.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2824.486s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's already a really difficult area to be a biker and to drive in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2829.247s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm curious if you have any kind of, even at this preliminary stage, if you have thoughts about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=2833.957s">[Kit Collins]</a>: traffic, pedestrian, bike lane, et cetera, mitigation that could affect the experience of getting there, the experience of residents for the better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4191.455s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Rowe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4192.536s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I really appreciate the discussion here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4194.096s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think, you know, this is housed within a broad topic that we as a Council and I think the community talk about all the time, but it's still helpful to hear the particulars, hear some of what you have in mind for a couple steps further down the process and put this in the context of those community conversations about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4213.596s">[Kit Collins]</a>: this hyper specific area in particular that intersection that street address mystic of quarter in general, and our aspirations for making certain areas such as this area more mixed use more community friendly and also contributing more to our tax base and kind of putting it more concretely in the context of those ideals is very helpful so I appreciate the back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4239.031s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Morell just mentioned, this is just the vote on the PDD and not this project specifically, but I really do appreciate this process and the level of granularity that we're able to have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4251.595s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And with yourselves as proponents, I think it is, I think that, how to put this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4265.347s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It makes me feel good about a development coming in saying we're going to invest in the community and going through this process when really nothing is certain yet and doing the legwork and doing that and really responding to the values that the community has put forth to say, this is what we want for this area and taking the time to put forward an application that is still in many ways hypothetical, but doing the zoning changes to presuppose that and make it possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4290.847s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's heartening and it's helpful to go back to the community and be able to say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4295.099s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, we have all these conversations about making this intersection less scary to walk across, more possible to walk across, like imagine walking to Wegmans, something that feels completely impossible to me, a person who lives a mile away from it, you know, being able to cross that crosswalk and beginning to see the early seeds of, you know, a more vibrant corridor that is contributing to the city's bottom line in real ways and kind of the harbinger of a walkable, interesting,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4324.874s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4326.456s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that's very appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4328.337s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm excited to be at this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4330.339s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think fellow councilors expressed this, excited to be at this stage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4336.364s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And yeah, and with that, I would motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4341.348s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, we haven't done that yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=5217.434s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=5312.988s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would motion to table until our next regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=5315.189s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I didn't get a chance to review them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=5778.068s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=5779.389s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate you bringing this up, Councilor Caraviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=5783.511s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, we've talked about resident issues on private ways in many ways, for many reasons on this council over the past couple of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=5790.975s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think this is, you know, as we all observe, this is a really tricky issue where we're doubly constrained or constrained legally with rules for what we can and can't do under certain conditions on private ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=5806.704s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're constrained by<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=5808.193s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Our resources, I'm sure that everybody who works for the city would say, well, if money was no object, we would fix every street and trim every tree in a private way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=5816.115s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Unfortunately, as we know, we're just not in the budgetary position to do that, nor to adopt all of the private ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=5830.307s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I am not contesting that whatsoever, just flagging that that's the issue that we run into, because we know and residents know that they're entitled to safe streets and, you know, traversable sidewalks and the same quality of their environment as everybody else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=5843.56s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we're hampered by this rule and our resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=5846.042s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's really the issue, because I think we're all in agreement that these are things that residents deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=5851.171s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm glad that we're opening this conversation again, and I think that this is a problem that ideally has some, you know, some short-term action steps we can take in addition to the long-term one, which is just to get the budget where we can incorporate all of these private ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=5863.516s">[Kit Collins]</a>: More to the point, I would just, you know, ask if you were open to also inviting the tree warden, since this, you know, pertains directly to her jurisdiction, as well as the DPW commissioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=5873.44s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we could have a really productive conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=5879.403s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=5879.923s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=259.602s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=262.323s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Rosh Hashanah was this past weekend, as Jews who are celebrating are well aware, and Yom Kippur is coming up next weekend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=270.045s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So to everybody who is celebrating, I say Chag Sameach, and may the new year be a sweet one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=274.106s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2408.836s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell, and thank you, Director Hunt and Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2413.318s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Storrs for being here again and for all of the context leading up to this vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2417.319s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate the discussion around this, this week, last week as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2422.841s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, as we discussed in our Committee of the Whole on this topic last week, you know, coming into this topic, my big concern was essentially, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2433.308s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What we don't want, I think what we know that nobody wants is to privilege any one part of the city over another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2439.949s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's not what we're here to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2441.87s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Nobody wants that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2442.55s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Even the folks who, you know, talking about Medford Square and how it's in desperate need of revitalization is the first thing out of their mouths.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2449.031s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think everybody's very aware that all across the city, we're in dire need of reversing chronic underfunding of infrastructure and resident quality of life and roads and sidewalks and infrastructure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2459.913s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We can go on and on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2461.453s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So, getting confirmation on, you know, what the diff is and is not was the first thing that I wanted to talk about in our committee of the whole last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2469.598s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And, you know, what has led me to, you know, want to enthusiastically approve this plan and then get to, you know, see it run out over the course of several years and, you know, kind of get the experiential evidence of how it's working.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2484.628s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's clear to me, or at least it's clear that everything that we know about this tool tells us that we know that this is not going to take anything away from the general fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2492.706s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have a reason to believe that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2496.304s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the infrastructure improvements this will allow us to make on the city-owned parcels in Medford Square may very well increase the size of the pie for the general fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2506.153s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's important to me because I care a lot about revitalization of Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2510.817s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would love for it if it was easier to bike down here and just enjoy the riverfront and not have it be a place that I have to figure out how to get to safely or meet friends at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2520.305s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think a lot of people feel the same way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2523.348s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that that's a thing that a lot of people share, you know, we see that and the comprehensive plan that was passed last year and I hear that whenever I just amount in the community talking to people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2532.076s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that that's I think that that's very much a community value and then the other part of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2539.951s">[Kit Collins]</a>: is the possibility for this really to be that flywheel effect that will become a feeder source for the rest of the general fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2547.418s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If we can see this as a unique opportunity to have this grant and develop this uniquely city-owned parcels right in the back of this building that are empty parking lots right now and have been for a long time, that's what's important to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2562.31s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If that then turns into increased capacity for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2565.233s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, I think that's a win win.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2566.314s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, starting to refund the rest of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2568.535s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um you know where there's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2570.497s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Where we see the evidence of chronic underfunding day in and day out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2574.46s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2576.461s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that can be a win win.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2577.822s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And you know, hearing that analysis, um, from Director Hunt and the consultants on this, um, you know, I think I'll echo what Vice President Bear says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2587.329s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's let me just<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2593.282s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it seems that at the very least, it's not going to be taking capacity away from the rest of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=2596.803s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It may well increase it over time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3144.843s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3549.522s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell, and I want to echo Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3552.084s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I really do appreciate the debate about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3553.744s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that between last week and this week, I think that, you know, especially for residents of this community, it's important that we look at this from different perspectives and that we share that openly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3567.693s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that I've made my stance and my opinion on it pretty clear, so I don't want to go on at length.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3575.157s">[Kit Collins]</a>: or beat a tired horse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3576.118s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But the other point that I do want to make that I forgot to make before was one thing that I found really compelling from our committee of the whole last week is that defunds should the city council decide to appropriate them and approve an appropriation to this effect would in fact, one thing it could be used for is improving our capacity for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3594.125s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Developing plans for Medford square for implementing plans from the comprehensive plan from the deaf master plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3600.329s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, I mean, to me, that's just 1 part of looking at this as a tool that increases capacity that doesn't subtract capacity from anything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3608.535s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It increases our capacity for getting grants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3611.016s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It increases our capacity for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3614.024s">[Kit Collins]</a>: taking our existing plans, comprehensive plan, et cetera, and making them more concrete and actionable as we're attracting development and investment in our infrastructure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3627.396s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But with that, I think I've said a lot about my stance on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=3630.279s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would motion to approve for first reading after further discussion with my fellow councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=4286.513s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to waive the remainder of the reading for a brief summary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=4399.728s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Monroe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=4400.808s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I wouldn't wanna preclude any discussion at this point, but since this is just a procedural step, I would motion to refer the zoning amendment to the Community Development Board, pending further discussion, questions, summarization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6082.906s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6084.147s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm, um, I'd like to hear what my other fellow councilors have to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6090.373s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6092.294s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I really appreciate the extremely compelling presentation from Attorney Dash, and thank you so much to the Alice family for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6100.117s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Certainly, the purpose for which you're seeking this deed amendment is, you know, I think it really speaks for itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6107.88s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's really in the spirit of what this council wants to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6113.903s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I see Director Hunt's concerns, and I think that one thing that's very appealing to me is thinking through this process, which is complicated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6121.729s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think that a deed amendment has come before me in my term on the Council before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6125.152s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I feel like I would appreciate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6127.018s">[Kit Collins]</a>: a little more chance to get into the weeds with Director Hunt, perhaps to make sure that we are taking this opportunity and optimizing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6135.543s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would like to have that conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6137.504s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that we have a motion on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6138.745s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would make a motion to perhaps refer this to the committee of the whole, with all haste, to meet on this, to meet with all relevant department heads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6147.67s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would like to make sure that I have a full grasp of the situation before<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6151.392s">[Kit Collins]</a>: quickly taking a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6152.853s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I will say if what comes out of that conversation is the best case scenario is just to approve the deed amendment as written.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6160.36s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll take that vote, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6162.201s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think I would just appreciate a more in-depth conversation about it before we take that vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6165.924s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I know we have a motion on the table, on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6169.547s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If we didn't, I would make the motion to refer this to committee of the whole and then back to a regular meeting too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6587.691s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I can't move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6591.134s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm happy to withdraw my motion to refer this to committee of the whole for Councilor Caraviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=929.382s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=930.042s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Nothing substantive to add, but just in summary, on top of what Vice President Bears just said, I think the substantive change in A is to bring that use table into alignment with the community's goals for that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=944.653s">[Kit Collins]</a>: through regulating mechanical car park uses to bring an alignment with community wishes and our comprehensive plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=951.116s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The rest I think are technical corrections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=953.136s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And in some cases, Scribner's errors, typos that we've, we and other bodies have noticed are in the zoning ordinance in the, a little over a year that we've been using it since the first pre-convocation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1422.79s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Merlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1423.891s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Director Hunt and Planner Evans for walking us through this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1428.156s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As was just stated, I think that the primary goal of putting these changes forward was to remove some of these uses by right because we want to mitigate how much they're encroaching on our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1438.228s">[Kit Collins]</a>: valuable land in this area that we could put to many other uses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1442.211s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it seems like with these recommendations on the slight amendments that the city board sent back, there's kind of a secondary goal of making it more consistent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1449.317s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Who is reviewing the special permit applications when they do come in aligning that with the right board to be reviewing it and making sure that the same board is reviewing for the same types of uses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1459.805s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think that that is really aligned with what we're trying to do with the zoning ordinance in general, making things both blend with our use goals and also just keeping things more consistent<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1468.59s">[Kit Collins]</a>: user-friendly inside and outside of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1471.051s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1682.958s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2532.279s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Merlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2533.559s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also appreciate this being put forward into the constituents that have been advocating about this, some of them for a pretty long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2539.481s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As Councilor Tseng mentioned, this has been, I mean, this is always coming up, but it's been coming up over the past couple weeks over a couple of different topics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2549.204s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And this council has<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2551.605s">[Kit Collins]</a>: spent a lot of time talking about the lack of code enforcement resources in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2556.029s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This comes up every budget season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2557.43s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's something that we, and by we, I mean as a city, not as a council, can't seem to fund and expand resources for that department nearly fast enough at the rate that we know there's a clear need for and that residents are on a daily basis observing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2573.524s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the need for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2574.744s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Obviously, rules are not self-enforcing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2576.605s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that these suggestions are really good to try to nip in the bud the problem of Airbnbs and things like them proliferating in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2585.388s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then we need an expanded code enforcement office to be following up on problems like these and all of the many other problems from potholes to obstructed sidewalks to overgrowth that residents are reporting every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2600.774s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in our community, and I really do regret and resent that when we exist at these substandard staffing and resource levels for basic city functions, it means that residents have to be code enforcement officers, and I really don't think that's fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2614.041s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think community members should have to be that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2616.122s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3664.056s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell, and I appreciate this bringing forward because it's, you know, essentially an example of what we've been talking about is what can we do to make it so these problems aren't happening in the first place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3673.878s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think the housing stability notification ordinance is a good example because that's using our existing city communication channels just to distribute what is information that's already existing rules that already exist, you know, using an existing communication channel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3689.762s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that that paired with having a liaison to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3692.947s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, Airbnb or a similar company, these are ways of saying, hey, before anybody starts doing anything that you may not know in good faith that you shouldn't be doing, here's how things work in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3702.674s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That paired with more robust enforcement, I think that that's what we should be rolling out for every, you know, all of these frequent flyer city problems that we know we see all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5072.924s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5073.664s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also just want to say thank you, Mr. Scullin, for working with Councilor Caraviello to raise this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5079.228s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sorry that it's taken you such a long time and been bounced from department to department to try to give voice to this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5086.953s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You speak very movingly about the need to, as a city and as working with our state agencies, to keep doing a better job of, you know, not always just catering to the average user, but centering people who are disabled, either temporarily or permanently,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5102.561s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All types of people need to get on the T, and this T station was built for all of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5105.905s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you for bringing this forward, and I'm sure that we're all going to stay on it to make sure that there are disabled parking spaces near this T station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5112.132s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6086.983s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6091.356s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate you bringing this up and I think that this, these two, this resolution and vice president beers is for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6098.705s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They rhyme together because when you look at the experience of this particular household on Emory Street and I had the opportunity to speak with one of the neighbors there as well as with representatives from our Board of Health Department and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6109.457s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There were a lot of details from this particular episode, which would not shock most people in the city who live with, you know, chronic code violations, you know, as a matter of course, but are still shocking to hear, you know, the way in which this particular, you know, quote unquote resolution was trying to be achieved to a truly unsatisfactory way, how much time it took.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6132.401s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But we're talking about the need to reallocate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6137.515s">[Kit Collins]</a>: or find new resources to make sure that we're spending money where it's going to be meaningful for our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6141.82s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Because currently, you know, I spoke to the Board of Health and they said, I think it was about a different household with a vermin problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6148.769s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They said, you know, same thing that you heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6150.791s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The one inspector that we have for that in this apartment is out on vacation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6154.756s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And when she gets back, she will start to work through<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6157.279s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the queue that has been amassing for her ever since she took her vacation, which I'm sure was extremely deserved because she's the only person doing this type of inspection in the entire city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6166.385s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No person is a superhero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6167.766s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is an extremely severe misallocation of resources problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6172.228s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And the downstream effect is that residents feel the lack of responsibility and the lack of communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6177.852s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And they see their complaints going under investigated and unresolved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6181.614s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's not because our city staff are doing a bad job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6184.696s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's because there just aren't enough of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6187.421s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know that we all feel that frustration day in and day out when we get these emails and calls, and we know that we feel it every meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6194.046s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7594.565s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7597.126s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate this discussion and I always find it, I'm always gratified we have the opportunity to make it clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7604.428s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think for the benefit of residents and knowing how to navigate our government, what specifically the powers of this council are and on what matters, we have to be advocates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7616.071s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And sometimes being the role of an advocate can be very gratifying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7618.572s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I mean, we've talked a lot about different ways of addressing this enforcement problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7624.093s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Throughout this meeting we've talked about you know the resolutions that are out because we've talked about we've tried to do in budget seasons, we've talked about convening a meeting with the building department and code enforcement and dpw and the mayor's office to talk about how can we address this from multiple angles we've talked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7640.026s">[Kit Collins]</a>: better allocating revenue to better fund these specific departments that we know need to be at least doubled, it seems like, if not more so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7648.331s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also really appreciate bringing up pilot, you know, pilot agreements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7652.894s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I, you know, as a Tufts alum myself, I feel like it needs to be, I try to say as often as possible,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7659.978s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is specifically an area because the neighborhoods that that affects that Tufts puts a lot of I would call, you know, abstract or immaterial things into its pilot agreement with the city, and we have existing material needs that are going on that that are exacerbated by the presence of the university for all the good that it does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7676.182s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is another issue where I think it's one where this council, what if it could would make direct appropriations more directly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7683.084s">[Kit Collins]</a>: help with these problems, and in a lot of cases we can't do those things, you know, just like making resolutions to advocate in the budget for allocations that should be made to put more resources into code enforcement and whatever else we need to start meeting residents' needs, you know, I would love to see us build up a process like that with PILOT as well, so that it's more related to the actual needs going unmet in this community, and not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7710.945s">[Kit Collins]</a>: these, you know, less than immediately relevant community functions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7716.908s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When, you know, I mean, we've been talking about code enforcement for feels like five hours, you know, it can go on all week just talking about code enforcement with the issues that get brought up to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7728.854s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I, I appreciate all the energy around coming to this issue from a lot of different angles, I think that we need to advocate for all of it, you know, the stuff that we can do directly legislatively,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7740.964s">[Kit Collins]</a>: we'll continue to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7742.285s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll continue to advocate around the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7743.726s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that we should redouble our efforts to, you know, for this council to advocate around pilot as we do around the budget as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7749.309s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I appreciate everybody who's weighed in on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8193.195s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, where are we sending this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8689.273s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell, and thank you, Vice President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8691.414s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that was very eloquently put.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8695.437s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As I like to remind people, I'm a Tufts alumni, so this is my atonement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8701.921s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just kidding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8704.643s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But as an alumna, I do feel a particular responsibility to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8709.79s">[Kit Collins]</a>: speak up in this case for the Tufts resident assistants who are seeking simply just to collectively bargain and a fair contract with their employer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8719.714s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also want to remind people that we're talking about an institution with a $2.4 billion endowment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8725.556s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is the same institution with a $2.4 billion endowment that doesn't pay taxes to us and does not volunteer to help us fill the gaping holes in our various municipal civil service needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8739.581s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Particular to the Tufts RAs fight, you know, I think that, you know, labor is labor and workers are workers and it's time to stop entertaining the narrative that seeking to collectively bargain is anything other than reasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8752.223s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I wish that Tufts would more enthusiastically respond with that attitude.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8756.724s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All experts, I mean, all workers are the experts on their work and RAs are the experts on their role in the campus community, which of course affects the Medford community in myriad ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8768.226s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They stabilize and counsel and provide logistical support for the dorms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8771.708s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think it's also true that the dorms that they serve have become more complicated and more needful in the past few years because of the pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8780.554s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm thankful to my fellow Councilors and community members for coming together to say, you know, Tufts has to quickly proceed towards a compromise solution and a fair contract because anything other than that would be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8795.202s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Candidly, a truly bizarre waste of their administrative time and resources, of which we know they have many.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8800.626s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we know that there's so many more important needs that those could be put to, not just making the campus experience more livable for those living and working on campus, but for the community as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8815.058s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9546.128s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9548.09s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Very briefly, and I think that if I might speculate, I think that the point here is not that there's a strategy that should be taken, but just that clearly the process<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9556.88s">[Kit Collins]</a>: is broken and that's why we see these labor disputes, these labor struggles in our own community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9562.085s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that we all want to see the overarching process change so that workers in our community, whether they're workers in our community that work for City Hall or workers in our community that happen to live on Tufts for now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9573.715s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that they can collectively bargain in a way that they can efficiently proceed to a just outcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9579.399s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm really heartened, and I think that this resolution and previous ones that the city council has worked on are evidence of this, that everybody behind this rail takes the opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9589.147s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And everybody in this community, I think for the most part, takes the opportunity to stand with labor when they can on the actions that they feel that they can take.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9595.391s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And behind this rail, I think it's our right to sometimes have different ideas of what is possible for us to do and what's strategic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9601.676s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's our right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9602.617s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have a diversity of opinions, but I think when push comes to shove, we are all doing our best to stand with the laborers and the workers in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9610.004s">[Kit Collins]</a>: With that, I would move for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9667.894s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9671.176s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2200.804s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2201.124s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that Councilor Tseng covered most of what I was going to say relating to locking bins being actually shown to be a really secure way to rat proof containers, just you know, I think it's a common misconception that composting can increase<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2216.642s">[Kit Collins]</a>: rat problems, I think that's actually not necessarily the case, which is great for the city on a lot of fronts because of those locking containers can actually keep rats out better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2223.443s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that the bigger picture that we're all really concerned about, we all hear about all the time is that everybody's seeing rats everywhere all the time, and it's a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2232.005s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And this is something that we need to start being proactive about so that we don't have to resort to those rat extermination measures that I think nobody wants to use that are also a threat to other beloved parts of our ecosystem, like the bald eagles along the Mr. River watershed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2246.248s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, I think this is something that comes up a lot on the city council this is, you know, to really attack this in a proactive way takes money that we don't currently have in our operating budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2256.872s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it would be great if we can align with our department heads and make sure that we're doing everything that we can be doing with our current resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2263.914s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we need to be pushing for that future operational budget so that we can have, you know, I think Councilor Scarpelli makes a great point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2270.896s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We need to have a standing working committee, working group, whatever that looks like, so that we're really addressing this problem and not letting it continue to boil over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2H_zQ7mI46g&t=2278.898s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=86.161s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=89.322s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Appreciate Councilor Tseng for bringing this resolution forward with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=92.684s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I also want to acknowledge school committee member McLaughlin who helped us with the idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=97.766s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And she actually liaised with Boston City Council member Mejia in Boston who worked on a similar resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=103.728s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I loved the idea of making an official proclamation to recognize Disability Pride Month in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=110.771s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's celebrated across the nation, across the world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=114.792s">[Kit Collins]</a>: disability has always existed, it will always exist, and like any other facet of diversity in our society, it should be acknowledged, it should be celebrated, and we should make sure that everybody across every spectrum of human being is adequately accommodated and embraced in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=129.618s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=339.4s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=1593.098s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=1594.798s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=1596.33s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And thank you both, Director McKibbin and Director Hunt for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=1600.691s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Again, I appreciate our longer discussion about this and our Committee of the Whole that we just wrapped up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=1606.133s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Definitely, I agree with the comments that President Morell and Councilor Caraviello just made as this gets towards finalization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=1613.094s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just for the benefit of residents who weren't watching the conversation that we had at 6 p.m., you know, I think that this, authorizing this contract, which stands to encompass<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=1624.228s">[Kit Collins]</a>: so many of our goals for getting towards zero waste, cost savings for the city, just a better experience for residents and businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=1631.65s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that this positions us to be in a very exciting place as a city and for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=1637.672s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, for me, I don't remember when recycling became the norm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=1640.933s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that happened kind of before I was a fully lucid adult, but I think we're at the point in society now where if recycling isn't available, it feels weird and it feels wrong to most people to not have that option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=1651.436s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think we're at a place<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=1653.317s">[Kit Collins]</a>: societally, where hopefully, you know, within the next 10 or 20 years, we'll get to that place with composting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=1658.439s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's so important for just the experience of being in our buildings and the overall waste stream, not to mention being a large emission source to not be composting these organics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=1669.364s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think that this is really exciting for the city to be in the position to be a part of that pivot in Massachusetts of institutionalizing, just something that we should be doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=1678.668s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=2435.649s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=2437.37s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate Councilor Caraviello for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=2440.832s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I took some time to read over the responses from Director Blake and Engineer Wartella that they sent over in lieu of their presence here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=2448.236s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One of the points that they mentioned is sort of in explaining<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=2455.296s">[Kit Collins]</a>: how the current interventions at this intersection came to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=2458.117s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I thought it was very interesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=2459.077s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think they use shorthand pilot to permanence for saying why we have these plastic barriers up now, which of course are not a permanent road intervention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=2469.059s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think it illustrates to me, you know, why so many of our conversations about every operational and infrastructural issue in the city eventually comes back to money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=2477.461s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that this is an issue that it is currently on the queue of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=2481.843s">[Kit Collins]</a>: projects where it sounds like the city would like to see a more permanent infrastructural solution, not classic barriers, not something movable, just something permanent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=2534.756s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=2535.157s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No, no problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=2535.897s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And you know no disagree with anything there I think that the point that, for me, the bottom line is, regardless of what we wish had been negotiated for at any point in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=2548.61s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My bottom line is now we have to do what keeps that intersection, and that road as safe as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=2553.515s">[Kit Collins]</a>: given the resources that we do have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=2555.237s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And right now that means the plastic barriers I think engineer Wartella, I think I have the number right so that there's been 300 incidents near that intersection the past five years, unacceptable, anything that that can make that intersection safer is what we should do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=2568.113s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I wish I mean this is why we talk about it all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=2571.937s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that we can make every intersection and road and site of passage in the city of Medford as safe as possible to drastically reduce the incidence of any type of accident, because that's just the most basic service that the city should be providing the people who get around here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=2588.167s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we're not there yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=2590.328s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I feel your frustration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=2594.031s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that this issue<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=2597.357s">[Kit Collins]</a>: it does bring up a lot of issues that we're grappling with in the city and our lack of resources to do things that the way that we'd ideally like to see them done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2580.201s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2581.602s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2582.422s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Director Hunt for presenting on this and giving us all the context around it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2587.164s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I certainly hear my fellow councilors observation about, you know, observations around doing things piece by piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2594.807s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I completely empathize with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2596.767s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that we're all, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2599.237s">[Kit Collins]</a>: think that this mechanism is kind of a bridge between what we have now and where we know we're going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2603.038s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have the comprehensive plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2604.339s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have the existing character of the neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2607.28s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We know what there's demand for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2608.48s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We know what's currently there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2609.441s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then we have plans to do a comprehensive rezoning and make sure that all of our neighborhoods are kind of brought into alignment with our comprehensive plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2616.583s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think that this PDD mechanism is a way to make sure that we don't miss out on these opportunities while we're still ramping up for that comprehensive<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2625.166s">[Kit Collins]</a>: project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2625.506s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm really glad that we have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2626.407s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think any of us want to bypass these opportunities while they're on the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2630.149s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And, you know, at the same time, very much looking forward to when we can do this within the structure of a comprehensive, you know, no or very few exceptions needed kind of zoning paradigm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2642.155s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I would motion for approval after many of my fellow councillors additional comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2647.518s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=2647.758s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3279.721s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would motion to waive the comment period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=3284.862s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I motion to approve waiving the comment period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4565.164s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4566.506s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you President role I appreciate this discussion and I think, in terms of my perspective on this to try to put it into a, you know, analogize it to something that most Medford residents, you know, perceive every day or drive over every day I would.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4581.44s">[Kit Collins]</a>: hate for our water and sewer infrastructure to take a similar trajectory to what we see on our roads and sidewalks, where we don't invest when we could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4588.902s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that deferred maintenance becomes more and more and more expensive, more so than if we had invested earlier on and tried to prevent some of those increased costs of fixing depreciated infrastructure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4602.186s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So trying to think about what's the more meaningful help to the constituency, trying to mitigate a short term<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4609.728s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to mitigate a rate increase in the short term, a small amount, or trying to sock away a fairly significant amount of money to deal with the backlog that's going to keep increasing towards doing some truly necessary repairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=4623.634s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5333.835s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well, I thank the resident for coming forward to raise the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5338.979s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think the council had the benefit of seeing some of the photos that the gentleman had took on his phone and I was picturing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5345.896s">[Kit Collins]</a>: delivery trucks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5346.716s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We saw a gigantic 18-wheeler.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5348.156s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is, you know, shocking and ludicrous to see such a ludicrously sized truck for a residential street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5356.378s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Obviously, one of the services that the MPD does perform is traffic patrol, traffic enforcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5361.559s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, this is a safety issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5363.74s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's a lot of the city to cover, but I think it would be, you know, if we know there are these priority areas that these huge trucks are taking advantage of, I'd like to see some increased enforcement around there just so we can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5376.159s">[Kit Collins]</a>: change the change the norms around that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5923.975s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NBziCeHHS8U&t=5928.779s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1581.468s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mr. Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1585.811s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1587.543s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Amy, thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1588.604s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't feel entitled to you sympathizing with anything that I have to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1592.325s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You have every right to be upset.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1593.546s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just, I don't want you to get up here and put yourself out there and may not respond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1597.868s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just want to say, if you think that we're getting everything that we want, I feel like we're not getting anything that we want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1606.593s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm speaking from the heart here, person to person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1612.756s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want everybody in the city to get a raise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1614.877s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1617.099s">[Kit Collins]</a>: cannot negotiate with unions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1619.379s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We can't make appropriations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1620.74s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's why my drumbeat for the past three months has been about these charter amendments, which I hope that I would get a call from the mayor by today saying that she's something to the AG and she didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1629.221s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's why my persistent frustration has been with our lack of power during this budget process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1633.882s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But it's not fair to me that your negotiations are not resolved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1640.103s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's not at all fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1641.783s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The whole process of bargaining negotiations of the city, I think,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1646.576s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Obviously unfair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1647.959s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Not everybody should get the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1649.261s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The people who are paid the least should get the most and it should go up from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1653.229s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All that is to say, I don't want you to think, well, you can think whatever you want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1658.285s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I want to put on the record, I don't think that what's happening is acceptable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1661.348s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I am looking at a situation where so much of what we see is deeply, deeply, deeply unacceptable to me, deeply unacceptable and unfair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1667.613s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it makes me sad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1669.334s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It makes me sad, but I am aware of the legal limits of my power.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1673.237s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So when a paper comes before me to give some employees a raise, if I have the opportunity to say yes to a raise for some people, I'll say yes to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1680.383s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm going to wish with all my heart that I had the ability to transmit that raise to people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1684.827s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that have to negotiate for it and I am sorry that I can't do more materially for you and your union in this situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1757.779s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3903.697s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell and I thank my fellow colleagues for joining with me in this resolution and I want to thank everybody in Medford who reached out to us over the past couple days to advocate for making sure that the spirit of pride and the flag of pride and the celebration of pride is, you know, echoes ever more loudly from City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3923.774s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's important every month of the year to let it be known that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3927.796s">[Kit Collins]</a>: people of all walks of life, especially people who are celebrating Pride Month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3931.659s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're glad you're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3932.559s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We support you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3933.2s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We want you to live your best and proudest life every month of the year, and that we here in the Medford city government, we're here to support you in that, and to let you know that you have allies behind this rail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3946.729s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8218.29s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8221.112s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Rowe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8221.852s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate the thorough presentation that we've gotten and appreciate the targeted questions from my fellow Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8228.396s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I mostly just have a point of clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8231.237s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All of the proposed traffic and pedestrian mitigation that we saw in the presentation, if this is approved, will all of those go forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8273.766s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8274.787s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate the thoroughness there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8276.509s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's always helpful to see sign off from the CDB, from department heads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8280.373s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, to me, I think that this is something that I'm glad that we're starting the public hearing process about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8283.857s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a large commercial space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8285.739s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's an underutilized part of the parking lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8287.601s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it would be great to see another establishment here for residents to take advantage of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8291.885s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11000.194s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The next motion will be to approve the site plan review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11003.015s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is my understanding correct that the CDB recommendations are attached to the site plan review?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11017.061s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sorry, my question was if the CD board recommendations are tied to the site plan review and do not apply if the vote gets less than five votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11027.266s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13429.34s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13429.66s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's a little hard to introduce words into this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13434.79s">[Kit Collins]</a>: climate, and I want to acknowledge that and I'm going to try to speak both my fellow Councilors and to the residents who are watching and I think that's very two very different audiences so I just want to acknowledge that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13450.649s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Here's my timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13452.349s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I went to the administration in May, and I said, these are my priorities, and I don't think I can vote for a budget that doesn't have these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13461.091s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I need an increase to the schools department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13463.952s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I need more money for the libraries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13466.072s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I need our zoning money back in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13468.373s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I need to talk about the clerical union, and I need some guarantees that starting next year, the budget process is going to be better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13474.974s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And at that time, I think pretty loudly, I said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13479.035s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I need guarantees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13480.076s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These are these charter amendments that the budget process is going to be better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13485.64s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13486.081s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That was my bottom line because I found the council's role to be largely unmeaningful and I know that's especially hard to hear right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13496.709s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But with this vote, I'm trying to put, and I hope that my fellow Councilors can, you know, I don't feel entitled to understanding on this tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13505.728s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I hope that in time, we can all relate to the feeling of trying to put a desired outcome ahead of my feelings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13511.212s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And in this case, I have tried to find the utility in being a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13519.226s">[Kit Collins]</a>: protest vote on this budget, and I've seriously, seriously considered it because this budget does not meet my values in many ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13526.668s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Even with the increased appropriation to the libraries and the schools and putting zoning money that we should have already had in there back in the budget, it still is not the budget that describes the Medford that we deserve to live in and that our residents deserve to live in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13539.972s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I just can't in good conscience say that me voting down this budget, being a vote against this budget, is going to be better for the people who live here<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13550.469s">[Kit Collins]</a>: then not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13552.611s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I told the administration clearly, more clearly than is comfortable for me as a person, I cannot vote for this budget knowing that the line item is not going to reflect the values that I have, unless we have an assurance that with this budget comes a better budget process next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13566.562s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it's less than I wanted, but it's a role for the council that I don't believe we would have had otherwise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13574.349s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it reflects investments in long-term budget planning that I don't think we would have had otherwise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13578.812s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I can say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13580.953s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, to residents who probably heard me over the past three weeks saying, I can't vote for this budget if we don't have an assurance that the council, that the residents get to vote on the council's ability to make appropriations starting next year through a charter amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13596.742s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I hope that this, you know, that process is going to continue for me as one Councilor, that process has to continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13603.245s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have to put that, we have to put that to the voters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13607.787s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In this case, I think that this is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13611.536s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My vote is about trying to make the best of a situation that I can't celebrate, that I can't feel good about, but I'm trying to do the best that I can with what's in front of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13619.721s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that's the context for my vote tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13621.962s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=13622.643s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15911.486s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No, I'm actually just waiting to be heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15913.007s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15914.701s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15917.742s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think I've made it clear that I know how I'm voting, even though this is a very difficult decision, and I think that we have a, I know that not all my fellow councillors feel the same way, and you're entitled to feel derisive of that, and I don't regret you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15932.447s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I hope you can understand that I'm coming at this from my own sense as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15937.669s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just to reiterate before I motion to approve,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15944.687s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, this is a difficult decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15947.088s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And when we talk about an individual fiscal year budget, I think it is hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15951.449s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We can't not think about all of the budgets after that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15956.31s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's hard not to think about long-term planning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15957.891s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's hard for me personally as one constituent and as one councilor to not be overwhelmed by the scale of need for everything that both isn't being funded in this upcoming fiscal year budget and everything that is being planned for five, 10, 25, 50 years after that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15971.575s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And in order to not be paralyzed by that and to make a decision,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15979.242s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have to think about what's within my jurisdiction, what can I make sure is in the budget, that we're better off having in the budget than wouldn't be, that isn't possibly on the table to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15988.071s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that's where I'm coming from, zoning, schools, library.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15995.277s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And if there's a way for us to get an edge for a more meaningful participation in the budget process starting next year,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16002.731s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's more than we could have gotten.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16003.992s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Otherwise, am I satisfied?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16006.073s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16006.594s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And if you want to tell a story about me being happy with this outcome, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16009.115s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's a story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16010.616s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But that's where my vote is coming from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16012.197s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=18039.991s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President real.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=18042.032s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just to add my perspective on this, I'm ready to get this done tonight I sense that they're my fellow Councilors, we don't, we don't have a super majority that's ready to get this done tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=18053.762s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But my reasoning is, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=18058.889s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that the idea of a stabilization fund is a good one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=18060.85s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that we probably all share that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=18062.131s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think that's a minority opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=18064.253s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Looking back at the past few years and thinking ahead to do we want this online for fiscal year 24 or not, past few years, we haven't been fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=18071.097s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We haven't been fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=18071.757s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've had a pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=18073.118s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Ask residents, we haven't been fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=18075.46s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What's different about next year is all this one-time funding is going away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=18078.321s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Do I think something catastrophic is going to happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=18080.843s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No, but if it did, I'd want to know that we did what we could to prepare.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=18085.926s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we don't have to do it tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=18089.09s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we should do it by the end of this fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=18091.092s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If that means arranging for a committee of the whole on a special meeting next week, I'll make myself available, but I think that we should do it before the end of the fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=18099.3s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we have had several months to think about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=18101.482s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=283.553s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Apologies, President Brown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=284.394s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm happy for you to open the meeting first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=590.437s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=593.26s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm excited that we've gotten to the point tonight where we get to vote on these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=596.723s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I thank Vice President Bears for noting that this is the sixth time that we've been able to meet and discuss these in public meetings so far this year and have the floor open for public comment and questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=608.934s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But at the same time, you know, I want to reinforce for folks who are watching this meeting that this is the beginning of a process, not the end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=616.22s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, should these pass, this would be no different from putting, for example, a debt exclusion on the ballot or putting a CPA amendment on the ballot, as was done several years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=624.668s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This leads it up to the voters to continue to discuss and consider and then place individual<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=631.313s">[Kit Collins]</a>: votes on these individual amendments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=633.995s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've said this before, but just to reiterate, you know, I think that these amendments would be additive for this whole community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=641.522s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Administrations change, but we always deserve a council that is truly empowered to represent our community members and act on their behalf, not just be a grandstanding body, not just be a rubber stamp.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=653.451s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Right now, this council can't appropriate resources to ensure that the policies we do pass actually get enforced or if they are just left to gather dust.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=661.114s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We can't hire staff to allow us to do our work confidently or effectively or with the resources that we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=666.937s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're not empowered to really collaborate with the administration to craft budgets that reflect what we hear from our constituents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=673.299s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So to me, these are important because these amendments would leave the community with seven more avenues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=678.301s">[Kit Collins]</a>: for meaningful representation in their city government, and that's really what it comes down to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=682.806s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The community's representatives should be able to actually materially represent them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=688.431s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this is about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=690.413s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, just making some important targeted tweaks to our 40-year-old charter so that we can start working for a better community now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=697.558s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Because I think that the work we have to do, the work that we've been trying to do, will be done better and faster with these amendments with a more balanced and collaborative government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=706.204s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I don't think that that can wait, you know, half a decade or more to be able to work more effectively for the constituents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=712.208s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2682.045s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell and I think the two specific questions that Councilors are probably raised at the end are important ones to resurface for constituents I think if he's making a motion to have a committee of the whole on those two I think, I think that these are topics that we've talked about a lot this term already and I think that our city engineer and others in the engineering department have offered really helpful insight I mean just for me as an individual Councilor and resident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2708.021s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The issue of how private ways interact with the rest of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2712.165s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Obviously, it's it's genuinely confusing and they've given us good counsel before and I think that sort of that causal chain like if this then what if you live on a private way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2721.393s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Clearly there's still more residents that we have to reach with that information I agree that we need a better communication strategy for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2728.339s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanted to raise you know I, I, I think that, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2733.655s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2734.657s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is clearly an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2736.64s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One, because it's come up again, because it's come up so many times before this term, whether we've been talking about in the chambers, and I know that I've had one-on-one conversations with residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2745.463s">[Kit Collins]</a>: many times in my pretty short term so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2748.426s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've had to go to the engineer and ask him for insight that I then relay back to the residents just about the various issues involved in living on private ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2755.873s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And the other thing that I think is important to note in this conversation in terms of, you know, what are the reasons that we're not serving our constituents and our constituents on private ways, you know, to the best of our ability is everybody is trying to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2769.046s">[Kit Collins]</a>: make do with pretty scarce resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2771.43s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I remember one of the things that I've heard from members of our DPW staff and our engineer in the past is, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2778.896s">[Kit Collins]</a>: matters of public safety are always prioritized when possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2782.899s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But our ceiling for what's possible is really low, and budgets are extremely tight when everybody's operating on skeleton resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2790.564s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I don't think that that is always the decision of individual staff people, but just operating in a very austere environment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2798.249s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think that's important to bring into conversation, because when we're talking about safety of our residents and safety of our residents in our private ways,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2808.619s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The decisions that we make and the decisions that the administration makes about the resources that we have to deploy around our community in the interest of aesthetics and public safety, that trickles down to individual cases like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2823.18s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so I think it's fair to say we need insight from this position specifically and that role specifically, but also to say, if we don't have resources to go around where most of the people who come to us with an issue on a private way leave that conversation disappointed, we need to take a hard look at our books and see what would it take to be able to better serve those residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2841.094s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Because as I know, we've talked as a council about how expensive it is to bring a private way back into the public fold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2848.866s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, you know, those are residents that were that we are sort of agreeing to leave in that situation when we don't build towards a plan where we can bring those back under public jurisdiction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2859.511s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I just wanted to raise the point that I think that this is this is part of the long term strategy to that we've been talking about all year is, you know, sort of lacking comprehensiveness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2868.714s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3973.743s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4521.336s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4522.957s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I agree with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4523.698s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that having a weekend opportunity is very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4527.961s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, people have different schedules, different work schedules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4530.362s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also want to note to Election Manager Ripley, I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4534.105s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think I misunderstood the previous motion we took.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4536.066s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I certainly didn't want to preempt your office's opportunity to speak on the presentation that you've created, especially since this is an opportunity to get the word out to residents and voters about what to expect for our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4549.221s">[Kit Collins]</a>: elections in September and November, so I know there's a lot of, you know, great kind of FAQ information submitted onto our agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4558.189s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Certainly, if there's anything more that you wanted to share or were planning to share relating to the Miss Paul elections, the sort of know before you go section, I'd certainly be eager to hear that from your office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4570.059s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4041.61s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Merlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4042.631s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you everybody who's been here about the petition or to speak your mind on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4046.513s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We appreciate all of your time and all of your perspectives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4052.137s">[Kit Collins]</a>: To reiterate some of my other fellow Councilors synthesis of what we've heard so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4057.001s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're hearing about parking enforcement, we're hearing about cleanliness code enforcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4061.924s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also heard about the prevalence of large trucks in an area that feels residential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4066.902s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It makes sense to me that this is controversial because we do have a thriving business center, South Medford Square live right by there, right next to what is a residential area and I think we always get these friction points where residential meets commercial and residential is residential and commercial is commercial and we're trying to make sure that both can thrive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4086.809s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Vice President Bears spoke to this at the top.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4089.511s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We so frequently as a council are talking about the many, many, many holes in our code enforcement that we see citywide, whether it is cleanliness or whether it is taking care of tree stumps, or whether it is responding to issues on see click fix.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4105.944s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Certainly we're aware of the same lack of capacity lack of effectiveness in our parking department as that, you know, takes its time to get up to speed, so to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4115.37s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that probably every resident, certainly everybody behind this rail, has just a laundry list of places where they don't see that consistent service that we need to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4125.957s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And, you know, the large trucks issue made me prick up my ears because I know that's an issue that, you know, falls under state jurisdiction as well as city jurisdiction in terms of how do we regulate these huge commercial trucks on our residential streets and how do we make sure that's fair for both users, the commercial drivers that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4141.667s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to get around businesses that depend on them, but the residents that are trying to have a human sized existence on their residential areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4150.453s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All that being said, I think where we're at is how many of these systemic citywide and sometimes statewide issues are relaying at the feet of Oasis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4162.061s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that's where I'm coming down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4163.562s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that we need to be fair here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4165.783s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We need to be fair to the business owner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4167.264s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We also need to work very, very hard to make sure that residents are protected, their quality of life is protected as much as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4174.767s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that Councilor Scarpelli made a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4177.808s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In the spirit of his motion, I'll make one that's slightly different, also for consideration for my fellow councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4196.494s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Certainly doesn't have just just to present a alternative proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4200.875s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And certainly Councilor Scarpelli, I appreciate what you put forward in the spirit of having a discussion where we can see where we convene residents and enforcement staff from the city as well as the business owners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4211.997s">[Kit Collins]</a>: An alternative proposal would be to just approve the license.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4216.558s">[Kit Collins]</a>: with a date certain for a committee of the whole over the summer after a 90 day review period where we do discuss what's working, how are things going, we convene parking enforcement, we convene code enforcement, we have a better sense of where those pain points are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4229.061s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And again, this is potentially under a 90 day review process, we're able to go forward and issuing another extended license to another thriving business in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4237.342s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we get the chance to say, let's hear from everybody about how it's going at a date certain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4242.723s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5800.39s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President real.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5802.292s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well first I want to thank the moms demand action community group for your stewardship of this resolution not just with us on the council with the school committee with various players in the mayor's administration the mayor herself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5816.007s">[Kit Collins]</a>: really always wonderful to see a community group coalesce around a really important matter of community well being, especially with something an issue that the gravity of which really cannot be overstated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5827.834s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you so much for your leadership on this resolution and bringing it forward to many officials and partners throughout the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5834.739s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you to my fellow Councilors for working with this on me to bring it forward to the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5840.262s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, this is a I know President moral.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5844.123s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We made her say a mouthful, but this is really a very simple resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5847.304s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, the safe storage program is something that many in the city have already committed to do something they're ready to do something that they're enthusiastic to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5857.828s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's just a matter of distributing information on how to keep guns that already exist in homes safer in those homes that they're away from kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5866.19s">[Kit Collins]</a>: where they can do no harm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5867.412s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's just about getting that information out to the community through communication channels that already exist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5872.197s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So it's low cost, it's really effective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5875.6s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think when we read statistics like this about something so horrible, something that really defies words such as gun violence, unintentional gun violence, gun violence that occurs in the home, it can be sort of numbing to read those statistics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5889.754s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that I think something like this, the measures that the Moms Demand Action Chapter has been working on, the Be Smart Safety Program, it's such a simple and effective way to make sure that more violence is prevented in our communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5902.442s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so I'm really glad to be a part of this initiative and hope that we can continue to be a part of the implementation to make sure that the word gets out to as many Medford residents as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5912.548s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9708.042s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well, I just want to thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9709.363s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I feel like there's not a lot that I could add that would be additive because you've said so much very clearly, briefly about what you've been going through for many, many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9719.387s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think there's anything that I could add to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9720.947s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That wouldn't just be rhetorical that we've said already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9722.928s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know it's very clear, you know, it goes without saying, but you've said it, what you need is not more statements of support, but actual results.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9731.892s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it's obviously demonstrably true that times are getting harder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9736.516s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Cost of living is going up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9737.737s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's not just inflation, it's cost of living, it's cost of everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9741.44s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we probably all feel this in our personal budgets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9745.904s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it's, we've been hearing about this for months, if not more, but it still is just completely, it's unfathomable to me how little you're being offered compared to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9760.791s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the real value of that compensation compared to what it takes to live in this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9766.355s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't get why we would make it so hard for people who want to serve their community to stay in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9772.901s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9774.302s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Like you said, nobody gets rich doing public service, they do it because of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9778.931s">[Kit Collins]</a>: some kind of you know wanting to invest in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9781.253s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Why are we making it hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9782.594s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm glad the Councilor Tseng brought up the, the $25 million in free cash that was certified last July that we heard about a couple months ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9791.46s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I said it then but when I heard about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9794.582s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I wasn't happy, I was disgusted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9797.284s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's like why are we sitting on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9801.418s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As you said, you're the lowest paid workers in City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9805.18s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So even if you were to get an 8% cost of living adjustment, I don't have the math brain that some other of my fellow Councilors do, but I don't think that would make a dent in $25 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9817.164s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want an explanation for why that isn't being allocated to bring up the baseline on the people who have needed it the most for the longest and haven't gotten anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9825.688s">[Kit Collins]</a>: To make an offer to workers negotiating and then rescind that offer,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9831.412s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's a negotiating tactic that I've heard about in other contexts that I thought was, I'm not even sure what the word is, hostile, openly hostile.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9843.46s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When I hear about that going on between other negotiating partners, it's meant to be intimidating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9850.565s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's meant to be a show of force, show of power.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9854.387s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Why would we do that to our clerks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9856.809s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9859.931s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9860.772s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We appreciate you being transparent with us going through I think we obviously have plenty of options to think through in terms of how we can handle this especially as the opportunity of budget season comes before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9872.502s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for continuing to invite us to your negotiating meetings and I hope that we can all stay in touch both inside and outside of this chamber, as things go on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=225.685s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=830.284s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President really I also just wanted to know this is I walked on this part of Boston have very frequently so I've seen what's you know was currently or was formerly in the space when it was a convenience store.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=844.82s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This strikes me as if the narrative here is you know we're trying to figure out what to do with this ground floor level that has to be commercial we're trying to figure out how to make better use of the space you know I'm certainly willing to go ahead and approve this if you know the owner wants to try it as a cafe instead of a convenience store it is true I almost never saw anybody going into that convenience store.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=863.711s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I definitely hear Councilors Garpelli's concerns about parking I think that making sure that we're not obstructing the roadway to ensure the safety of the roadway is really really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=871.995s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On the other hand, it's kind of hard for me to look at a potential commercial space and have it go underutilized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=876.379s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, I think that we see the issue of cars parked where they shouldn't be all over the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=881.483s">[Kit Collins]</a>: To me, that's an enforcement issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=882.844s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, I don't want us to be tampering down on commercial development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=884.986s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'd rather see rather CSB doing proper enforcement of where people shouldn't shouldn't be parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=890.07s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1475.263s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1476.805s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1477.946s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for being here to share more about your, your business and I was looking also at the definition of this type of retail establishment in our current setting code and I have to agree with my fellow Councilor or the definition that exists in our muni code is certainly outdated included some.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1495.188s">[Kit Collins]</a>: interesting references from whenever it was written, but in this case, you know, clearly from your description, it's a store that's providing services and retail of a spiritual inclination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1506.273s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I agree with Councilor Scarpelli, I think this is going to bring an interesting flavor to Medford Square that doesn't currently exist there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1513.116s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And you know, towards the goal of bringing more people of all different inclinations to our business districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1519.439s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this could be a great thing for Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1520.86s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2915.558s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Rowland.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2916.459s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Henry, and to the rest of the Commission and Elections Manager for being here today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2920.961s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Really appreciate the thorough rundown, you know, as it's been stated, you know, I think we probably all heard from one or two constituents after the last election, sorry, after the last election with some concerns, you know, some confusions, and I think this really details the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2934.509s">[Kit Collins]</a>: commission is pretty forward looking being really proactive on, you know, making sure that every is dotted every T is crossed a couple times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2942.954s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that's really great to hear and it's great to hear all the detail behind that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2945.435s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So clearly this is a team that's really good at working together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2948.336s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2949.337s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And you know, I'm sure we'll be in touch as September and November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2952.939s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Get closer to hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2953.939s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3663.414s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3665.616s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Brown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3666.457s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Director Driscoll for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3668.559s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm glad that we get the opportunity to vote in support of this again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3673.244s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know you were here January last year for an earlier step in this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3676.587s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just think that this is a really great example of how, you know, public housing and Medford investing in public housing can, you know, be a great example of what affordable housing should be in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3687.137s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm glad that this CPC recommendation came through so that Medford can invest in its own public housing locally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3693.48s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that this really exemplifies that, you know, to build to expand public housing in the community is expensive it takes a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3701.124s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We need to be making these investments early and often adding 98 affordable units to our community is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3708.247s">[Kit Collins]</a>: such an important thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3709.527s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know it's been a multi step multi year process that you've been shepherding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3713.089s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that's just really important for people to understand like how much it takes to be adding these permanently affordable units to our community, as well as just exemplifying that affordable housing can look like a lot of things that can be that can look like a lot of different types of households, different types of families, but that it should be rehabilitated, it should be modern, it should be high quality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3732.635s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that this is just a really a really great example of a project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3735.416s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm glad that we are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3736.876s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to be able to, you know, chip again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3737.856s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um you know, part of our fair share of this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3739.817s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3740.357s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3741.297s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5080.345s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5082.386s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that we had a really interesting, thoughtful, deliberate conversation about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5088.066s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Recently, we discussed these proposals in Committee of the Whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5092.087s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As Vice President Bears outlined, we're going to have, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5097.028s">[Kit Collins]</a>: continuing opportunity for Councilor input for public input, as we discuss these proposals further.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5103.712s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But just to briefly reiterate, you know, some of what I said at our last meeting on this and some of what I heard my fellow Councilors say that really resonated with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5110.536s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think Councilors Scarpelli said this is a way to keep the council relevant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5115.199s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that really sums it up, you know, these three proposals combined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5119.702s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We talk a lot about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5121.683s">[Kit Collins]</a>: our frustrations with not having the tools, the resources, the people that we need to function as a legislative body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5128.688s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think the politically easier thing to do would be to stay in that state and say, well, you know, we're doing all we can with what we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5137.073s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a measure to say, actually, that's not good enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5139.255s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're going to make these specific amendments to the charter so that we actually do have what we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5144.258s">[Kit Collins]</a>: so that we can do the work of representing our constituencies that we can do the work of legislating passing policies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5149.764s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that will free up a lot of this council's energy to be a complimentary working partner with the administration across the hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5157.852s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Instead of, you know, unfortunately being forced to expend a lot of energy, really trying to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5163.773s">[Kit Collins]</a>: trying to have that co equal relationship.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5167.216s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, I think that we, it's better to enshrine in policy in the charter, a way to have the powers that our constituents need us to have in order to do our work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5178.787s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's not just like I said last week, that's not just for this term, it's not just for this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5182.991s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's a way of saying to the community of Medford, you deserve to have a city council that is functional,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5188.095s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No matter the, the climate inside this building no matter the political weather, this council is always going to be empowered to be working for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5195.518s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I look forward to discussing this further and I'll certainly be supporting this tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5939.7s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was probably going to reiterate the point that Vice President Bears made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6735.334s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6736.214s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate Councilor Tseng putting this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6738.996s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that this is, you know, for the community, probably one of the better examples, you know, simplest examples that we have about our backlog of capital needs in the community, you know, just demonstrating when we defer maintenance over the cost of, over the length of, in this case, you know, 30 to 40 years, that maintenance over time gets more expensive because we can't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6759.924s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're not paying to prevent or stop the damages that are currently occurring, let alone the ones that we can already, you know, see and observe and that people are reporting on see click fix all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6771.048s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that our engineering department is well aware of the scope of the problem they're doing all that we can I think that it, you know, demonstrates<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6777.03s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the need to be finding cheaper ways to resurface these roads where we can like Councilor Knight said, and it also demonstrates the strong need to figure out how can we start paying for this more quickly so that these needs for repairs are not mounting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6790.973s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we're just continually continually playing catch up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6793.634s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I also want to note I've had a lot of friends of mine who are also cyclists specifically complain about Riverside, which is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6799.835s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, because the pothole situation, basically unbreakable so I just want to throw that in there to let cyclists know everybody is going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6807.279s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Everybody is walking around frustrated because of the road situation in Medford, and you know, cyclists are as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6812.141s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7309.79s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it was, was it 21631?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7313.131s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm trying to figure that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7314.675s">[Kit Collins]</a>: just so we can compare.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7341.871s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7343.912s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If I may, I just want to state for the record, I'm not opposed to this paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7346.993s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this is something we should discuss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7348.314s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that it, you know, I certainly understand the argument for not spot changing our rules, but I just, you know, I hope that this is something that we can discuss, you know, after the cooling off period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7358.018s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If we've confirmed that, that's, you know, procedurally the action we have to take.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7361.699s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8109.428s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8111.411s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8112.292s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate hearing my other colleagues perspectives on this and I, you know, we've we've talked about this issue before we talked about this, we voted on this for first reading, I know that there's a variety of opinion on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8123.446s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think people know where I stand my, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8126.59s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Similarly, we can only vote on what we have the power to vote on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8131.792s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We cannot affect direct change of the things that we do not have the jurisdiction to affect direct change over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8138.816s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is something that we get to vote on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8140.416s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that these people deserve raises.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8142.357s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that everybody deserves a raise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8143.998s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I wish that we had the opportunity to affect that, but we don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8147.179s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I also, I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8148.68s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The more important point here I think the it's not really an elephant in the room it's just what's on everybody's mind because I think everybody's really worried about the only piece of the budget that we have had an indication about so far, which is the proposal given to the schools, and it is I think impossible not to consider.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8168.036s">[Kit Collins]</a>: these expenditures in the context of the really worrying number that was given to the schools over the past couple weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8173.941s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know that that's something that we all care a lot about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8177.184s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think I want to, you know, kind of underline something that Vice President Bair said, which is that we get to choose, you know, whether this conversation is about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8189.357s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well, I guess we're in the position of having to choose between this loan order or the schools or this proposed wage adjustment or the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8197.101s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's not the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8198.482s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's not a binary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8200.203s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's not the choice that we're being presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8203.165s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's a version of that narrative where that is what's happening, but that's not factual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8208.708s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that we all wish that we had been in meaningful, deliberate conversations about crafting this budget for a long time now, and that hasn't been the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8218.412s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But we have meetings and meetings ahead of us where we can be saying what I think is already known about our shared council priorities for this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8227.596s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think it's no secret that, you know, in June of last year all of us were very willing to disapprove the budget that didn't meet a single one of our council priorities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8237.521s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And, you know, I go into this budget season really willing to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8240.862s">[Kit Collins]</a>: communicate and collaborate and, you know, be in dialogue with the administration about the things that I need to see in the budget in order to be a yes vote on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8249.131s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's no secret.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8249.952s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8252.198s">[Kit Collins]</a>: know, obviously, proper funding for the schools where layoffs are not an issue is a huge part of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8257.64s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We go into this with the information that we have, including, you know, a pretty sizable free cash number that we learned about just a couple months ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8265.223s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All of that is context that we can use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8266.783s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We know that the money is there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8267.924s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's a matter of appropriation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8269.124s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's a matter of allocation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8270.165s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't buy the narrative that it's sidewalks or schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8273.266s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't buy the narrative that it's non-union personnel or schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8276.467s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it can be both, and I'm willing to have the conversation to get there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8279.288s">[Kit Collins]</a>: for tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8280.749s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that these are things that we should approve, and I just wanted to explain my reasoning on that, and I hope that over the next couple months, we can be unified as a council on lobbying for a budget that our community deserves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8290.656s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9437.677s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9439.098s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Bernal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9439.918s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9441.199s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that the frustration that we felt around some of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9450.277s">[Kit Collins]</a>: information or lack thereof that we've gotten in the city's financial health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9453.599s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think that that anger and frustration is fairly directed at the department head so we might be receiving it from I think that it's all a symptom of the same problem, which is that this city does not have the resources and the tools that it needs to be thriving and fully functional and reasonably staffed and have all staff be reasonably compensated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9469.946s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9474.418s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, I think that we all share the same values here and I really want for us to be able to continue this conversation over the next couple months with our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9483.786s">[Kit Collins]</a>: knowing that we share the same values around this and knowing our real roadblock and adversary here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9488.65s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do not think that this is unionized personnel against department heads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9493.775s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think this is unionized personnel against non-unionized department heads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9497.218s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I don't think that any of my fellow Councilors are saying that for the most part, but I think that we're in the danger of rhetorically falling into that trap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9505.244s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I don't wanna leave the community with that impression because the non-unionized personnel are not the problem here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9513.045s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the folks, you know, everybody deserves that Cola increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9517.367s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We can't fix the situation of union bargaining in the city by withholding this vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9522.67s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's why I'm not going to withhold my vote of support on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9526.05s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think I've said all this before, but it's just, it's so important to me that I want to say it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9531.212s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we can't fall prey to this misdirection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9535.014s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have to know our real roadblock here because our real roadblock is the one that we all agree on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9539.796s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it's the fact that we don't have the political will to allocate the money that we do have to pay everybody and bargain with everybody the way that they to be bargained with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9551.658s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's why I won't be withholding my vote on this tonight because I don't think that this is the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9557.023s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we've been talking a lot specifically this evening and also in general about the tools that would empower us to deal with the actual roadblock here, but this isn't it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9566.791s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=84.559s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I found them in order and I move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=103.548s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you to President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=104.529s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We had a first meeting on a proposed ordinance to protect seekers of gender affirming and reproductive care in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=113.812s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll be meeting again to discuss it further.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=117.193s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=304.639s">[Kit Collins]</a>: motion to waive the remainder of the reading for a synopsis by the presenter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=309.261s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2180.284s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell and Mr. D Antonio I just wanted to share my, you know, and how unfortunately got hit in that intersection I'm glad to hear that you were doing okay but so sorry that you had to go through that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2190.018s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2190.88s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, I think that it seems abundantly clear to me that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2195.446s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, we talked about the particularly troublesome intersections in the city that particularly troublesome roads, there's so many of them I think it's just clear that roads were not our roads are not built for the Medford of today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2205.389s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So to fix it we need to, you know, approach the problem on all fronts to accommodate, you know, all of the road users that we see right now I think the Councilor car VL brings up a really good point which is, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2218.912s">[Kit Collins]</a>: several decades ago, we didn't have ride share companies inundating the streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2222.274s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We didn't have these delivery companies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2223.654s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's something that I notice all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2225.155s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It drives me bananas when I see delivery drivers blocking traffic, blocking parking spaces, blocking bike lanes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2232.318s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's a lot of new dangers and there's just a lot more cars on the road than there used to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2237.0s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So clearly we need to marshal all of our city resources to make sure that people can cross the street, can get where they're going without<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2245.043s">[Kit Collins]</a>: without being hurt or have to fear getting hurt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2248.386s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you, Councilor Caraviello for putting this forward I think it's one part of the puzzle and Mr. D'Antonio I hope you're feeling better very soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=1767.927s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Hi everybody nice to see you all I know some of you I don't know all of you Hope to know all of you very soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=1780.35s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I can't speak on personal experience to what the Zoning Board of Appeals is doing about Regulating and observing the Development of condos in Medford, but I can't say on the City Council side some action that we are trying to take<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=1795.07s">[Kit Collins]</a>: do what is within our jurisdiction to observe and moderate and regulate the conversion of rental units into condos in Medford because I think especially in this neighborhood it goes without saying what an impact that can have to take rental units off the market and also, you know, these speculative market forces turning neighborhoods into, you know, the commodification of housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=1818.713s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So the city council has begun to look at a condominium conversion ordinance This is something that exists in many similar communities close to us in the region what that does or what it would do what's proposing to do is to put a set of conditions and stipulations on the conversion of certain rentals into condos in Medford and so<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=1838.673s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're in the really early stages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=1840.033s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's lots of time for community input zba input neighborhood input on How this should be targeted where it should be targeted But the main thrust of that is to say if you are a for-profit developer that's coming in and turning Neighborhood homes, especially rental units into condos that are going to be flipped from which a for-profit developer can derive a lot of value we need to make sure that value is getting put back into the community because of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=1864.738s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, it's only fair the developers are making money off of the housing stock and the wonderful neighborhoods and the amenities that we have here in Medford the community needs to be benefiting to maybe that is measures to improve stability for the tenants the residents that are getting displaced because of those conversions in Medford<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=1883.313s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Maybe it's an appropriation into our very new affordable housing trust in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=1887.736s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's something on the ordinance side, thanks to the advocates for that, recently passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6gZWVWRAa_8&t=1892.6s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But that's something that we are looking at and we can hopefully work in tandem with the ZBA to make sure that when condo conversions do occur in Medford, that they're occurring at a pace and in a way that is very careful about the impact on the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=3916.907s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=3917.707s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for the presentation so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=3919.208s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's good to get into the details on some of these plan changes that we've been hearing about for a little while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=3924.81s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll just say this at the top because it's gonna go for a lot of the other planned intersections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=3929.733s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that the RFP here is really important on Winthrop Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=3933.854s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's a busy street, it's a popular street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=3935.655s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's well-traveled even in this kind of tucked away corner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=3940.757s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think as one councilor, I'd very much like for that to be a part of our affirmative vote and for other, just so I don't say it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=3946.9s">[Kit Collins]</a>: six more times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=3947.841s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think for any of these streets that are being considered, you know, Boston Avenue, Salem Street, you know, Highland Ave at Middlesex, like a lot of these are very busy, very commercial, you know, well traveled by vehicles as well as pedestrians.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=3960.93s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As long as we're doing the crosswalk improvements, I think that we really have to see those flashing signs for pedestrian safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=3966.878s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just say that at the top.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=3967.919s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then I think for this crosswalk in particular, I'd love to have the director of traffic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=3971.84s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that you've been liaising very closely with our draft director of traffic and transportation, but just to make sure that, you know, his local expertise is considered on this intersection in particular, before we go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=3982.524s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4003.447s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's a little face talking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4417.672s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Does anyone have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4420.535s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4420.815s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just for clarity, in terms of procedurally, it seems to me that this is also an opportunity to start making that shortlist of additional improvements that we'd like to see at specific sites so just be able to log those for the record even if we're revisiting them chance to get more out of this opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4551.3s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4552.861s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, yeah, this is another one where I was going to, you know, again, request for an RRFP at this intersection as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4563.208s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm in the pro bump out camp, you know, I cycle through this intersection as well as drive and walk through it, and I think that's a, there's a real visceral need for those permanent structures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=5363.022s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Berloz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=5364.163s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was just gonna make a similar comment about an RRFB.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=5368.13s">[Kit Collins]</a>: at this location, and actually just for my understanding, sorry if you just said this, but just to make sure getting the, I wanna make sure my web of jurisdictions is accurate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=5378.636s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So in this case, with this being a DOT jurisdiction crosswalk, we can pass the recommendations along to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=5385.96s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You are liaising with them to get all the permits, but these improvements will be implemented by the DOT.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=5979.435s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I guess just I wanted to add my, I think this has been expressed, but I think obviously talking about different scopes, guys think in terms of the entire transit system, for us, we're representing people, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=5992.077s">[Kit Collins]</a>: get around the city of Medford, get it to adjoining communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=5995.719s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In terms of the average weekly riders, I'm sure that 50 per day is kind of a drop in the bucket in terms of your scope, but in terms of this community and our size, especially thinking about how for a lot of people, if they're taking the bus, it's because they don't have any other option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=6010.667s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just another voice in the chorus for these bus stops that are in the ballpark of 40 to 50 or more weekday riders, I think that I just wanna take another<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=6021.212s">[Kit Collins]</a>: moment or two week period to make sure that you know, effective butters people who for whom this is an important part of their commute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=6027.934s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's a small number but it's also a fairly significant number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=6030.034s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=7900.28s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you very much, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=7902.342s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Margaret Akito was a longtime Medford resident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=7905.105s">[Kit Collins]</a>: She lived on Manning Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=7906.166s">[Kit Collins]</a>: She lived on Luther Road for decades, and her family was and remains deeply connected to this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=7912.512s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also understand that Margaret was a very faithful and dedicated watcher of our Tuesday night City Council meetings, and so I hope that my fellow<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=7921.037s">[Kit Collins]</a>: colleagues will join me in letting her family know that we are thinking of them during this difficult time and holding a moment of silence in her honor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=7965.085s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=7966.186s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So it's that time of year again almost for the biannual Walk, Bike and Roll to School Day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=7971.91s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this is a great way to get young riders out on the streets with the safe chaperoning of adult riders that accompany them along their routes to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=7983.499s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=7985.1s">[Kit Collins]</a>: many in the bicycling community in Medford are organizing these bike trains on April 4th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=7989.461s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I would, you know, issue a heads up to everybody who's commuting or out on the roads that day to make sure to take extra care for additional cyclists out on the road that day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=7998.563s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And as you know, as always much appreciation for much appreciation for the Safe Routes to School program and all of the cycling activists and volunteers that make this celebration possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8010.025s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8024.471s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Really?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8025.071s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8030.453s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we're super prepared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8033.554s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Advance warning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8148.583s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8149.703s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that, well, it's always a good time to celebrate women's history.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8154.384s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's always a good time to reflect on the contributions of women to society, our community in particular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8161.226s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have so many pillars of our local Medford community who happen to be women.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8166.847s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think it's always the right time to reflect on members of marginalized communities that have made outsized contributions to the community that we enjoy today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8174.589s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9700.091s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President real.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9703.851s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Tough to segway away from such a powerful topic, but I wanted to take several items off of the table that are due for third reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9711.037s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I can read those numbers out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9713.299s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's five of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9714.24s">[Kit Collins]</a>: 22519, 21053, 22058, 20024, and 23057.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9742.591s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh yeah, let's do that one too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10057.783s">[Kit Collins]</a>: just keep it consistent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10462.26s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10679.132s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10680.694s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10681.574s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I also want to, you know, I don't want to just bring this up and vote for it uncommented on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10686.496s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I want to be clear that to my fellow councilors, I know that don't agree with voting on this tonight at all, you know, that I, I hear you and I really genuinely do respect your opinion and sympathize with where you're coming from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10698.801s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I feel the cognitive dissonance of having those workers in the room before, and, you know, for weeks and months before this and having those discussions and hearing from them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10707.295s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and then taking this up, I feel it, it's palpable, and I think I really hear and understand where you're coming from and that difference in strategy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10716.26s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But for me, the reason I feel that this is important, and I think that Councilor Behr has put this really well, for me, the cognitive dissonance isn't between this type of positions and the collective bargaining units positions that they represent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10728.307s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's between all workers in the city of Medford and this financial strategy that leaves money on the table while not giving every worker<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10736.618s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the raise that they deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10738.8s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That is the cognitive dissonance to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10741.001s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think, you know, Councilor Bears put it well, what do we have the power to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10745.384s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think if we had the power to say, you have to give at least a 3% raise to all of these unionized workers in the city, we would have executed that already because that's where all of our hearts lie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10755.371s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If we had that power, we would have done it already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10757.113s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We don't have that power.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10758.093s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that all of us are going to continue to try to advocate for those workers how we can, but given that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10765.19s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Our jurisdiction here is limited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10766.651s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Our power here is limited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10768.811s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's important to me to move this needle forward because we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10772.213s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I just, I don't expect that to persuade anybody who sees the strategy differently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10776.034s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanted to explain my view to let you know that I do sympathize with other approaches to this and I, well, thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=11184.382s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=11185.543s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=11186.323s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I appreciate this discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=11187.443s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was going to move the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=11189.003s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1236.465s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell, and thank you, Vice President Bears, for putting this on the agenda tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1239.706s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I too received a lot of messages from constituents after this very sad passing of a very beloved local bald eagle passed several weeks ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1250.01s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think this is a problem that can really only be appropriately addressed regionally, not only because cities kind of can't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1259.543s">[Kit Collins]</a>: address the issue of what rodenticides are being used on a piecemeal basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1262.525s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We can't, you know, influence what private individuals are using.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1267.707s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But also, you know, I think a statewide regional approach is what's going to make these less harmful approaches cost effective for places like municipalities and institutions to implement, so that we can make sure that what we're putting into the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1280.347s">[Kit Collins]</a>: into our food chain, into our ecosystem is preserving the biodiversity such that we have along the mystic that I think we all really care so much about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1286.351s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'll be happy to support this this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1288.292s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I really hope that this advances on the state level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1290.414s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2883.249s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2883.589s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate the discussion on this issue so far for my fellow Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2891.215s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I just want to note I think that this dovetails with the conversation that we just had about the discussion of a capital improvement plan I think that this dovetails with the conversation that the rules and ordinances subcommittee was having immediately before this meeting about measures that we can take within our power of the city council so that we can be a better<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2908.567s">[Kit Collins]</a>: more meaningful, more actual source of representation, source of influence in the budget on behalf of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2916.89s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think President Morell, you say it all the time, a budget is a statement of values.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2921.031s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that the measures proposed in this resolution kind of cut to the heart of some of my most frequent frustrations with what we hear from constituents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2930.853s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Why isn't this happening?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2933.26s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Why isn't this, which essentially comes down to why isn't this budgeted for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2936.241s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Why is the supportive service not exist in our city?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2939.641s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Why are things like this in this department?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2941.061s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Why are things like this infrastructurally?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2943.142s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And to have no real other recourse or explanation, but to say, I wish that we could at least have the discussion about what it would look like to appropriate funds so that this would change in the schools or this would change in the roads or the sidewalks or that we could entertain forming this new department to better support the segment of the constituency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2960.425s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We don't have that power.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2961.785s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All that we have is the power to cut, to make line out of subtractions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2966.248s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think we're all very aware of what that kind of power results in, in a budget process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2971.132s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's not democratic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2973.814s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There are a lot of elected officials in the city of Medford and there's only one that has a meaningful role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2979.622s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in the budget process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2980.602s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think that these measures could potentially get us to a new solution around that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2988.164s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Another one of our, I think our most common refrains in terms of deep, deep frustrations is not having the staff to carry out even the things that are within our jurisdiction to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2997.406s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's, I don't really have words for how frustrating it is sometimes because I think it is a rarity for a council to be this unified on so many issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=3007.335s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's a really big hurdle to overcome in any public body, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=3010.798s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And yet we hit a stumbling block because we don't have the resources, we don't have the personnel to execute the work ethic that we do have on a disparate set of issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=3024.629s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think that whatever form this takes, if it's the form of a home rule petition, I think this is a discussion that needs to happen because I think these are roadblocks that could really be orders of magnitude in terms of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=3036.41s">[Kit Collins]</a>: increasing our influence to better represent the will of the community in these chambers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5191.505s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Merlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5192.722s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Commissioner for being here again to speak on this again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5195.546s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this all sounds really reasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5198.891s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One of the things that I hear about from constituents most often is repairs needed on sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5205.004s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this is something that we all care about a lot because it's an accessibility issue and we need to make sure that, you know, all of our sidewalks in our city are traversable for all residents, no matter how they're getting around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5214.688s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So for a lot of intuitive reasons, I think this is something that it is important that the city is able to continue moving forward with because this backlog of repairs will only grow and get more expensive over time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=5224.631s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm happy to motion for approval for first reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6862.892s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6863.932s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Director Dixon, just a quick question for you, if you're able to answer it, and if it's off the cuff, that's totally understandable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6873.339s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I was just curious, if you knew the amount of our certified free cash when this loan order was being submitted to the council, would it have changed your opinion or your posture on this issue?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=7909.88s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=7910.341s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thanks, guys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=7911.201s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate your deference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=7914.925s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think I probably have what might be an unpopular opinion on this paper, so I just wanted to get it out of the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=7920.229s">[Kit Collins]</a>: First, um, you know, another another Councilor said earlier in this meeting, you know, we've spent a long time since we had a full compliment of department heads in City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=7929.737s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's affecting our ability to move forward as community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=7932.72s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that that's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=7934.081s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, one of the reasons why it's important to make sure that we are doing what is within our power to retain the skilled public service workers that we do have within City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=7946.369s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know for very good reason, we've had a lot of discussions this year about the plight of our unionized city workers for good reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=7958.498s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we've been asked to advocate for those workers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=7960.479s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think whenever possible,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=7962.42s">[Kit Collins]</a>: this council has tried to, and I think that's something that we can be proud of and that we have to continue to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=7968.683s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I don't think that the narrative here is the non-union titles versus the unionized titles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=7974.285s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's a false binary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=7975.745s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that we need to stick up for the city workers that are unionized as well as sticking up for the city workers that aren't, because everybody is experiencing cost of living increases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=7984.528s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And the issue here is fair bargaining for those workers who are unionized at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=7989.402s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We need to keep people in the building, to keep the lights on, to keep the wheels turning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=7992.704s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that's all I'll be supporting this paper tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=7994.665s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I look forward to hearing my fellow councilors perspective on the matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=10517.652s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you President Morell and I appreciate the context around this from my fellow Councilors and from Director Dickinson and I came into the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=10535.015s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Ultimately, I think that a stabilization fund is a good thing for a city to have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=10537.758s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's one of those things that we probably should have had already and it's good for it to be enacted now or at least this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=10545.005s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm fine with the idea of moving it into a committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=10547.187s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do think that there's a broader scope to this discussion that I would perhaps prefer to have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=10555.615s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think a big part of that for me is this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=10561.606s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry, it is getting late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=10563.107s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's not slowing down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=10567.19s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, this announcement of the stabilization fund request arrived at the same time as the announcement of the certification of $25 million in free cash put forth as in the posture of something to celebrate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=10580.039s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't really think that's something to celebrate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=10582.721s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You've been in a pandemic recovery for three years preparing for future emergency spending needs<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=10590.813s">[Kit Collins]</a>: is good, but when you look at the amount of under-investment in pressing urgent needs in this community that have gone under-invested in and frankly under-acknowledged over the past few years, I'm glad if this means that we are turning a leaf towards more investing in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=10607.888s">[Kit Collins]</a>: urgent material needs for our community that we need right now when we need them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=10611.431s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think this very vast overflow is evidence that we have not been good at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=10616.074s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think frankly, that's a source of shame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=10618.376s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think what would make me feel better about kind of hastily throwing together a stabilization fund now is if we can get a commitment that this will also involve material investments in areas of greatest need in our community soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=10634.845s">[Kit Collins]</a>: maybe that could be an appropriation for an affordable housing trust as soon as that comes online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=10638.947s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think that kind of thinking does make more sense in a broader discussion what we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=10643.489s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What is this going to be for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=10644.49s">[Kit Collins]</a>: How is this going to be funded in the future?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=10646.231s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And what can we expect this to be used for based on our track record of not always taking available opportunities to meet urgent needs for stabilization in our community, like the three years that we all just witnessed and lived through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=10659.057s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11330.564s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Merlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11331.425s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanted to thank Commissioner McKibben and Director Hunt for speaking on this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11334.667s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Obviously, I've heard about this issue more than my fellow councilors as a member of the Solid Waste Task Force, and we discussed in the context of that body, you know, how it's one of the things that makes this very, very expensive budget line item, the waste hauling contract,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11350.733s">[Kit Collins]</a>: feasible both for perspective haulers and for the city are these long contracts for some of the reasons that Commissioner given just spoke to, I think if, based on the question from Councilor Knight and what Director Hunt has heard from the legal counsel that we do have available to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11366.207s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, I know that we're in previous meetings, we've discussed the RFP timeline for getting this out to haulers to getting those responses back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11375.675s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If, you know, I wanna make sure that we get a satisfying opinion on that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11379.598s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also wanna make sure that this timeline is proceeding the way that the experts say that it needs to, so that we can be proceeding along and getting these competitive bids and keeping things on schedule again, all towards the goal of getting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11393.936s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the best bids that we can on this really, really outsized piece of our DPW budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11398.537s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'd be happy to motion for approval tonight based on that context from Director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11403.519s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11799.169s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11800.449s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate the discussion around this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11802.75s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate the context from some of our department heads that have been working on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11808.192s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that there's disagreement on this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11810.193s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I am swayed by Commissioner McGibbon's point that I don't see why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11814.914s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And again, this isn't a vote on a contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11816.795s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's just a vote to enable these departments to pursue a contract longer than three years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11822.737s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So we're not marrying ourselves to any<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11826.476s">[Kit Collins]</a>: contractor company, I would motion for approval with a roll call vote to try and move this forward, and maybe we can concurrently get a legal opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11833.778s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11837.619s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's right, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3985.318s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell, and thank you, Vice President Bears for continuing to work with council leadership and city staff to get this ordinance into the version that we're voting on for first reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3998.962s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Tonight, another many years of hard work has gone into this ordinance predating my tenure on this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4005.966s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's about time in many ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4008.627s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This has been a work product spread out over many years with input from many local and regional housing experts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4017.052s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And what's most important to me is that there is a incredibly demonstrated need for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4024.704s">[Kit Collins]</a>: affordable housing in Medford and mechanisms for creating affordable housing in Medford and repositories for funding for affordable housing in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4033.029s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's already a discrepancy between the people who are eligible for affordable or subsidized housing and how much of that type of housing that we already have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4041.434s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So in a lot of ways, creating an affordable housing trust is really just a preliminary step, but it's one I'm glad we're finally taking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4047.197s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6683.645s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6688.266s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6689.806s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell, and thank you, Tim, for being here and providing helpful context around this paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6695.748s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think my feelings are similar to Vice President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6700.288s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I feel that I would be comfortable going forward with this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6704.807s">[Kit Collins]</a>: paper this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6705.908s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm comfortable tabling it if we table it to a date certain, March 14th, our next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6709.851s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this is an issue that we encounter very often as a council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6717.737s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm very sympathetic to our need to take actions that force action because we haven't had a super consistent track record of seamless collaboration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6733.658s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So far, that being said, you know, I feel like I also say this often, there are, you know, I think every individual player has to make decisions about what they're willing to hold up and what they're not willing to see held up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6748.067s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And all of these projects, you know, that come before us are important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6750.528s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's up to each of us to make our consideration of what we're willing to place on hold in order to try to force another action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6758.093s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think this is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6759.409s">[Kit Collins]</a>: a really important paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6760.309s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that, you know, sidewalk repair and road repair is an accessibility issue that touches everybody in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6764.451s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm comfortable tabling it for one meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6766.472s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Beyond that, you know, I think this is really important to make sure that it goes forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6770.213s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And these greater issues of budget and, you know, continuing, I think what we've had are really great first steps recently in greater budget transparency, continuing those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6780.457s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I hope that we continue those<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6783.379s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in parallel, and perhaps if we are amending this paper to ask the mayor for a determination on if KP Law is functioning as an acting city solicitor, if we could also perhaps include an update on where we are at with hiring a city solicitor and assistant city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6805.11s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that that was in the works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6806.471s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I haven't had an update in a while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6808.492s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm taking it on good faith that that's a real project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6811.094s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I believe that it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6812.338s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and I think that we're all incredibly eager to see whether we actually get the opportunity to know when that in-house legal counsel will arrive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7948.852s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7956.704s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate my federal Councilors sharing their thoughts about this, and I appreciate that it is kind of in conversation with the previous paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7964.449s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I will be supporting this tonight, and like I said on the previous paper about the loan order, I would have been comfortable going forward with that paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7977.417s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we heard from the expert in the room that it's not gonna be catastrophic to wait on that for two weeks, so I was comfortable with that middle ground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7985.792s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I also said, I think every council has to make their own decision about, you know, what tactics to use and where we feel comfortable drawing a line in the sand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7995.536s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And as Mr. Bears put it, weighing those balances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8001.398s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As every project that comes before us is important to the functioning of the city in some way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8007.661s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My understanding, this is the first reading anyway, and we know that we're getting that legal opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8014.071s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And this, the creation of this position I think is very overdue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8017.134s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's very important to the city it's important to me, the D the, you know, acting traffic and transportation director person currently in that role once it's codified I think is one of the experts in the city that I've turned to the most of the city councilor on the incredibly responsive it helped me out was scores of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8036.377s">[Kit Collins]</a>: constituent problems and complaints and questions over the past 14 months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8041.659s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I just think that the creation of this position is critical to where we are as a city today in the 21st century with just the sheer amount of traffic and transportation related projects and problems that come across my email inbox.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8057.824s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a motion that I'm personally not willing to wait for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8062.705s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'll be voicing my support tonight,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8066.53s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thanks, my fellow Councilors for listening to my explanation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9451.431s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9452.611s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I wanted to use the council as a forum to make sure that as many Medford residents as possible heard about this upcoming change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9459.954s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Our nation's leaders have allowed for extra pandemic assistance to expire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9464.135s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So on March 3rd, every household that's currently using SNAP can expect to start receiving at least 95 fewer dollars a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9471.918s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is potentially very damaging to households, especially as cost of living and cost of food remains high.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9477.245s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and local governments have been asked to help get the word out so people can prepare as best they can to fill the gap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9484.027s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Residents are encouraged to contact the Department of Transitional Assistance for more information about how they will specifically be affected to see if they can qualify for those new increases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9493.63s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I did hear from the City's Director of Communications today that the City of Medford is planning to broadcast<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9498.832s">[Kit Collins]</a>: this information and those links to resources on the city website and social media channels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9502.695s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So to residents who are looking for those details about how to investigate this further and look into resources that they and their households can potentially use, I would counsel them to be on the lookout for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9514.885s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9597.627s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9599.864s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Love to see mutual aid infiltrate the council chambers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9602.625s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9654.771s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9656.192s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9657.792s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This council has talked about similar legislation in previous sessions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9662.694s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The current pilot program statewide still exempts wealthy nonprofits like universities from paying taxes, property taxes, and that short changes cities like ours from much needed, fairly deserved tax revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9676.398s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These are not the shoestring kind of nonprofits that probably the word comes to mind with these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9684.198s">[Kit Collins]</a>: high wealth nonprofits that are property tax exempt, their revenue is increasing, their endowments are often quite large, and it's not logical for them to be exempt from paying taxes to their host communities, something that every other resident and type of business is required to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9699.505s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this proposed legislation would be to change the existing law to make large nonprofits<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9705.717s">[Kit Collins]</a>: no longer able to pay taxes or compensation on a purely voluntary basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9709.839s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so I asked my colleagues for their support for this bill, which would make larger organizations, sorry, large organizations start paying their fair share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9717.582s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think we can all imagine the very material ways that recouping some of that lost revenue from large nonprofits like Tufts University and my Alma mater, how big of a difference that would make in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9728.646s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10296.547s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell, and thank you for co-sponsoring this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10299.708s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is pertaining to the National Opioid Settlements against the manufacturers and distributors of opioid painkillers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10306.251s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Late last year, it was announced that five additional settlements were reached with more opioid distributors, and states and cities are being allocated funds to go towards prevention and community-wide rehabilitation as resulting from the national opioid epidemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10322.305s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The council did actually receive an update from Director of Communications earlier today with some good news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10328.17s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are confirmed to receive a distribution as a result of this settlement and our Board of Health and Office of Prevention Department staff has already been anticipating the five additional settlements, which is to say the city is on top of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10346.611s">[Kit Collins]</a>: which is great to hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10347.852s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm grateful to hear that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10350.034s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just to share with the community, the update that we received, which I think was also disseminated early December, these funds can be used for sort of pertinent uses such as opioid use disorder treatment, support for people in recovery, harm reduction, prevention of opioid misuse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10366.387s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And the city has a number of next steps that they'll be conducting community outreach about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10372.612s">[Kit Collins]</a>: including establishing a promote prevent support behavioral health commission, um, feedback and listening sessions with the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10382.06s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And the city council will be hearing more about, um, the specific plan and role of that commission as it gets formed over the next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10938.418s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well, I thank Councilor Tseng for putting this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10940.981s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this is a clear example where, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10945.011s">[Kit Collins]</a>: words matter and formalizing the right policy matters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10947.552s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think it's, you know, a really, it puts our community in a very positive, strong light that this is a policy that our city staff are already carrying out and what we can do as a legislative body to make sure that we are using our power as a forum and a speaker box for the community to make sure that it's known to as many communities as possible, sorry, as many constituents as possible, that interfacing with any city department<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10974.847s">[Kit Collins]</a>: regardless of your immigration status, is a good thing to do, a safe thing to do, and that they can trust the outcomes of that interaction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10981.788s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that codifying this formally will help us just promulgate that to more of the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10987.11s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so I'm happy to support this tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10989.17s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2297.667s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you President Earl I'd be happy to provide a summary of this ordinance and a summary of the process that has gotten us to where we are today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2304.15s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm very gratified to be able to put this ordinance forward for first reading the council has been discussing modifying and evolving this ordinance for almost a full year, almost a full year now in the public health and community safety subcommittee and committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2318.027s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and in one-on-one conversations with city administration, our chief of police, and other department heads, legal experts, and with community advocates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2325.431s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This ordinance is about being proactive to safeguard our community against nascent, privately developed surveillance technologies, which are both rapidly evolving and severely underregulated at the state and federal levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2336.918s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this is a very exciting moment for this council and for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2341.24s">[Kit Collins]</a>: While we would be far from the first city to have a CCOPS ordinance, Medford has the chance to be a real leader here and a model for other communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2349.123s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This ordinance, with the inclusion of some floor amendments that I'm going to propose in a minute, presents a clear and a structured way for the community, the City Council, and the administration to communicate and to collaborate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2360.968s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The outcome of that communication and collaboration<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2364.022s">[Kit Collins]</a>: will be the development of use policies and parameters for surveillance technologies now and in the future that are properly weighed benefits and the risks of these technologies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2372.529s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When we do choose to put surveillance technology to use in our city, we will know that we have had the intentional conversations about costs and benefits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2379.694s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We will have discussed the potential risks and the helpful benefits and how to balance both so as to safeguard community members against threats to personal privacy, civil liberty, and over-surveillance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2390.262s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As a city council, we will know that we have a guaranteed seat at the table when potentially large impacts to our constituents' lives and potentially huge purchases are decided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2399.245s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We will have a clear and a structured way to let this people's forum be a people's forum on these very real 21st century issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2406.507s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we will be able to guarantee that our constituents have a chance to ask questions and to be heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2410.869s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Surveillance technology is already in use in communities around America.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2414.19s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's no turning back the clock on this new class of corporate technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2417.531s">[Kit Collins]</a>: However,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2418.512s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We can do what we can under our local purview to take this as an opportunity to involve the public to hear from experts and to build trust between our government and our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2427.797s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So the version of the ordinance that we'll be voting on tonight is the product of four years of advocacy by the community coalition behind it, and months of discussion among city council and the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2438.502s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Since March of last year we have substantially modified added to and subtracted from the original draft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2443.985s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These changes centered around paring down the reporting requirements to make this ordinance more manageable, making it more clear that routine office tools are not considered surveillance technology, and also clarifying the reporting requirements are to be high level and general rather than onerous and granular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2461.587s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Throughout this process we have had productive good faith conversations with this administration, especially this chief of police in those conversations we've been able to address a number of outstanding concerns that were raised even after this ordinance was reported at committee, and I know that no document is perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2477.976s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And there are partners within and without of this administration, who have, who would have preferred different approaches to certain aspects of this ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2485.34s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Still I'm grateful that we seem to have reached an agreement across a broad range of stakeholders on a set of amendments that we believe would make this ordinance doable workable for this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2495.307s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And there is a document before Councilors, along with the clean and also redlined versions of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2501.503s">[Kit Collins]</a>: ordinance tonight, outlining the floor amendments that we intend to propose, and I will move that they be adopted prior to us taking a vote tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2510.968s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So, to sum up, I believe this has been a collaborative process helping us craft what I think is the most Medford tailored version of this ordinance that we could have arrived at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2520.186s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In short, this ordinance would advance the goals of transparency, accountability, community participation, and trust building, goals that we all share, within a scope that our department heads can accomplish within their existing duties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2532.842s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I thank my fellow Councilors for their deference with my preamble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2537.801s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and I ask for your support tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2539.103s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And President Morell, I know that there are audience members here to speak on the ordinance, and I would ask if you'd be willing to invite them up to speak after my co-sponsor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2547.978s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3178.93s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3180.772s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3182.437s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell, and I appreciate my colleagues thoughtful consideration of what's before us this evening, not just a 12 page ordinance, but also 12 floor amendments to go with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3191.459s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And Councilor Scarpelli, to your point, I honestly, I do hear you on the legal council piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3196.4s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that that is a concern that this entire body shares, and I'm sympathetic to your view that, you know, at some point we have to draw the line when it comes to demanding appropriate legal representation for this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3207.262s">[Kit Collins]</a>: At the same time, I've made this clear many times<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3210.577s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to me, serving in public office is a privilege.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3213.279s">[Kit Collins]</a>: None of us know how long we're going to get to sit in this chair and I'm committed to doing what I can while I can for a lot for as long as I sit in this chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3219.282s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So when I hear about an ordinance that a community group has been pushing for for four years, if I have the opportunity to work on it, I'm going to work on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3226.187s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's my personal opinion and I respect yours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3228.668s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On the issue of the 12-4 amendments,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3232.173s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, I think this is something that is procedurally well within bounds so there are other comments that I've heard that I don't quite know how to countenance but if any of my fellow Councilors would like us to go more in depth on what's before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3242.823s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know we did kind of a speed read round I'd also be very happy to walk anybody through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3247.848s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I touched on this in my opening remarks but all of these floor amendments have come from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3253.043s">[Kit Collins]</a>: conversations that we have had with the city administration over the past months, in the past two weeks, as recently as today, all in service of trying to pass an ordinance that is manageable and doable for this administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3266.295s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sorry if that process didn't feel transparent at first blush, but there's, you know, all of this in spirit of this ordinance can be talked through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3274.583s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3276.383s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3498.792s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No, these are, these are, sorry, Councilor Caraviello, these are new amendments that we're proposing after it was reported out of committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4211.288s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4212.827s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you chief appreciate you being up here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4216.149s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, like I said earlier today, I really appreciate your candor, I know that this is a difficult conversation I really appreciate that you've been willing to have it with us with me for a year with others for four years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4225.994s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, I respect where you're coming from and I just want to reiterate that I don't want to repeat our conversation from earlier from two weeks ago, etc.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4234.005s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, to the extent that we're having this conversation in the public forum, just for the sake of responding to you and putting it on the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4240.049s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, I do want to emphasize that, you know, again, our intent here is not to be anti-surveillance technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4247.915s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, that there is a reason that the ordinance is called Community Control over Public Surveillance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4251.718s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's evidenced by our December Committee of the Whole when we had a whole range of city departments petitioning for exemptions or asking questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4259.483s">[Kit Collins]</a>: How will this affect me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4260.384s">[Kit Collins]</a>: How will this affect me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4261.865s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's really not our intent to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4263.897s">[Kit Collins]</a>: target your very reliable department specifically, and I hope that you know that that intent is sincere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4269.699s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've done our best to enshrine that in the language of the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4273.82s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is intended to be proactive, not reactive to anything that your department or any other has done or done wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4281.201s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, I think I try to say often<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4283.989s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, policy and ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4285.83s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They're not about just today and they're not about tomorrow and not about next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4289.331s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They're about decades and even generations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4291.752s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, they're about putting something in place that will benefit the community when nobody who's currently in this room is still in this room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4298.254s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think we've tried our best to create a policy that will be right for the community, even when, you know, there's the next Jack Buckley leading the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4307.478s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And even when the city council looks entirely different so that we still have those structures for community input<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4313.335s">[Kit Collins]</a>: for transparency, regardless of who is at the helm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4318.098s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, over the past year, we've heard your very reasonable concerns about making sure that this is something that you can actually do, because we all know you have so much on your plate, and we've tried to only pare down this ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4329.724s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just want to say all that for context, for folks watching at home, for others who are participants in this process, and to say, you know, I really do appreciate your good faith discussions with us throughout this entire process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4341.11s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's really appreciated, and I hope that you do feel<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4343.608s">[Kit Collins]</a>: heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4344.188s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=4344.669s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6170.547s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Brown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6173.095s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What a treat to have two of my ordinance projects come before the council on the very same night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6177.617s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Good thing it's a holiday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6179.198s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm very glad to be bringing this forward tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6181.619s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This paper was first proposed by Councilor John Falco in 2021.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6186.041s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Very grateful to him for proposing this paper and for the opportunity to carry the project forward as Housing Subcommittee Chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6192.383s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In contrast to the ordinance that we just discussed, this ordinance is extremely simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6196.685s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It creates a new requirement that all property owners in Medford distribute a simple, perhaps one or two page document prepared for them by the city to their tenants at the beginning and termination of any lease or upon eviction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6209.296s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This document would also be provided to homeowners that are being foreclosed upon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6213.059s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The goal of this policy is to make sure that all residents in Medford are aware of the housing rights to which they are already entitled, and the resources that are already available to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6221.106s">[Kit Collins]</a>: People should know what their rights are, what to expect, and where to turn for help before some kind of stressful or emergency situation occurs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6227.49s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This information is often hard to find.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6229.651s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Whether you're a tenant, an owner, or an owner being foreclosed upon, having to scramble for information, or not know where to turn for help benefits nobody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6237.195s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This ordinance ensures that relevant information is distributed through the community in a streamlined way proactively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6242.758s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to just briefly outline the process of this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6245.84s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The council has been meeting on this paper since the fall first in the housing subcommittee, and then in a recent committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6251.563s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We began by discussing the examples of three of our neighboring communities, Cambridge Boston and Somerville, who also have housing stability notification ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6259.708s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We compared and contrasted these ordinances and selected the best parts of each example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6264.13s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We also reviewed the actual notification document that's currently used in each of these cities to inform our discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6269.633s">[Kit Collins]</a>: At every step we discussed the ordinance with the city departments that would be implicated by this ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6274.275s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These partners included the Board of Health, which stepped up to do enforcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6277.977s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability volunteered to create the housing notification document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6283.103s">[Kit Collins]</a>: based on resource documents that their office already has available, and they also consulted on how to best begin the rollout of this ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6290.526s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The Office of Prevention and Outreach, whose work in our community is closely aligned with the goals of this ordinance, offered their insight on equity and implementation strategies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6299.729s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm very heartened that this ordinance has the approval and even the enthusiasm of our city departments that are already responsible for housing stability and community outreach projects in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6310.12s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Finally, I just want to say this is an ordinance that is primarily intended as an educational tool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6314.662s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thanks to the collaboration and the input of our city partners, I believe that this ordinance will be simple to implement and serve as another tool toolbox for promoting stable housing in Medford, through expanding awareness of existing housing rights and resources in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6370.203s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6376.557s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6377.658s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, thank you for that question, Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6379.56s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This doesn't currently exempt any housing situations other than short or long-term like hospital care facilities in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6387.607s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I believe it would implicate student housing situations, whether that's private property owners or the dormitories themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6395.734s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I wanna be clear, this doesn't create any new housing rights or responsibilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6400.339s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It doesn't create the right to remain<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6403.982s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in a housing situation for longer than a person would already be able to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6408.286s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's just a simple document that's delivered upon move in and move out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6485.908s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Collins, Advices and Affairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6488.109s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6488.85s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Knight, for entertaining this line of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6493.854s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that we discussed similar issues with the Director of the Board of Health at our recent<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6500.183s">[Kit Collins]</a>: committee of the whole around enforcement, the fee structure, fine structure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6504.305s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The $300 was booked because it's statutorily defined and also because it's commensurate with other fines for ordinances that we already have in the books in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6512.728s">[Kit Collins]</a>: More importantly, when we discussed, when we were kind of first hashing out who would enforce the ordinance earlier in the subcommittee process after it was determined that it'd be more appropriate for it to be the Board of Health rather than code enforcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6525.813s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, like I said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6527.324s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this is a phrase that I probably borrowed directly from Director O'Connor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6530.706s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is primarily intended to be an educational tool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6533.388s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This ordinance isn't on the books that we can go around issuing $300 fines to landlords that don't know that this is something they're supposed to be doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6540.132s">[Kit Collins]</a>: After all, the penalty for the first warning is a written fine, and this is to be endorsed, sorry, enforced at the discretion of, in this case, the Board of Health Director or their designee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6551.078s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I say that to say, I don't think that this is the kind of thing where<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6554.777s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, if a landlord is delinked and accidentally, or we have some kind of extenuating circumstance, overall, it's at the discretion of the director of the Board of Health to enforce this towards the goal of actually promoting housing stability, not towards it generating revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6570.867s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that was a discussion that we had pretty explicitly with the Board of Health director earlier in this ordinance process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=7077.775s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Can we take those separately?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=7251.019s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=7254.585s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=7254.946s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanted to note before we take the vote on this Council and I appreciate your amendment and thinking through this on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=7263.847s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Having not considered such an amendment before, I think it's worth putting on the record that as a Tufts alumnus myself, I've seen firsthand, I don't think that this is an ordinance that would be in any way difficult for them to implement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=7276.833s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that there is some value for an institution that professes to be a community partner to participate in such an ordinance so that should students move off campus after graduating from Tufts University, like myself, that they are given a headstart in, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=7293.281s">[Kit Collins]</a>: like we're talking about being aware of the housing rights and responsibilities and resources that they can expect from their community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=7300.626s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I don't know that this is a major point, but I just felt it's worth expressing that I don't think it's going too far to ask a major and wealthy community partner to participate in a good faith ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=7313.094s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2499.376s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2501.478s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2502.559s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Mr. South, for being here for tonight and for always keeping us updated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2508.123s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, there's a lot that's astonishing in what you shared with us tonight and what you've shared with us over email in recent days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2516.052s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's hard to even remark on it, but I wanted to just thank the rank and file that you represent for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2521.953s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for your organizing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2523.614s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for your efforts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2527.015s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's so much to really be astonished by, even though we've heard, I don't even, I'm running out of adjectives to use, you know, the scope of what's being offered to your bargaining units compared to what could be expected to be reasonable or fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2542.638s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just one thing that's ringing in my head<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2545.295s">[Kit Collins]</a>: 2% with concessions in a climate of six plus percent inflation, it puts me at a loss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2554.122s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm glad to see that the rank and file is not willing to accept such an offer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2564.049s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that one of the exemplars of this, we're actually outsourcing or privatizing the folks who are negotiating with our collective bargaining units.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2572.835s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And if there's not a crystallizing example of this problem, if that's not it, I don't know what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2579.519s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's a really frustrating time, I think, to be on the city council and have what rounds down to no power over the root causes of this, which is our inability to invest in our city employees the way that they deserve and the way that our city deserves, the way that our residents deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2596.248s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2601.102s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Obviously, this all comes down to will, comes down to the will to invest in our city the way that it serves, and that it comes down to the ability to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2610.108s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're talking about the budget, but all of our realm of possibility here flows from that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2614.451s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we passed this year's budget on June 28th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2618.133s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this probably goes for all my fellow councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2619.955s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What date did we start worry about our next budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2622.076s">[Kit Collins]</a>: June 29th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2623.997s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's a discouraging time to be in,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2628.977s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to be looking at what's going on right now and staring down the barrel of what we're ever going to be able to offer to the folks who make the city work and make the city run next year and the year after that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2644.52s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When it comes down to what we're able to offer the city employees, it's not just the work that they do, it's investing in the people themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2652.861s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I don't know how we're going to expect to maintain, let alone improve our city and the experience of our city if we're not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2659.126s">[Kit Collins]</a>: figuring out how to invest in the people that make that happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2662.568s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I just wanted to share some of my disbelief over what we are hearing tonight, what we've been hearing, and thank you to all the city employees that are standing up for what you deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5340.327s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5342.249s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you to all BJA's representatives for joining us again in the chambers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5348.133s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just to pick up on the thread that Councilor Knight was speaking to, for the benefit of residents that are observing this process, ultimately this is a permit that is allowed by right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5359.703s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I wasn't on the council when this process began.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5361.905s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's, as it's been stated, it's no secret that this was a project that not everybody on this council was convinced was needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5368.89s">[Kit Collins]</a>: here in Medford but it's a by right project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5370.932s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm really grateful for this process that's allowed us to get clarity on hearing from residents, knowing exactly what neighbors want to see from this space in order to, you know, see that reciprocal relationship more fully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5384.45s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, through this process, I think we've been able to arrive at a package of conditions that can address specific things that the abutting neighbors need to see to get to specific outcomes that will help us be as as neighborly as possible as possible when this gas station goes into operation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5403.41s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, and really attach that as a condition to the permit, not a handshake deal something that we can continue, make sure is followed up on and make sure that this relationship is as good as possible for the people that will affect most directly, the butters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5418.9s">[Kit Collins]</a>: your willingness to engage in this process and really deeply appreciate all of the constituents that reached out to us during this process on both sides of the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5429.669s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think what's before us is kind of a best case scenario for this going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5434.173s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'll be supporting this this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5435.894s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=131.491s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I found them in order and I move for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=2797.745s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Rowland.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=2798.525s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for the thorough overview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=2801.487s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On the vegetative screening along Woodruff Avenue, I'm just curious, what's the timeline on the sort of what, if that were to go in, when can residents expect to be able to fully enjoy that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=2811.011s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't know to what extent it's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=2812.823s">[Kit Collins]</a>: planting of existing adolescent trees or waiting for a lot of growth to happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=2986.661s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=2987.482s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One more question while you're up here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=2989.243s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate the notes about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=2992.107s">[Kit Collins]</a>: pursuing better signage and a towing policy for unauthorized trucks in the parking area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=2996.87s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that we also heard from residents about some problems, noise pollution coming from potentially authorized trucks with a lot of offloading happening into the evening hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=3006.737s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was curious if, is there currently a policy around that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=3010.779s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is that something that could be resolved as well?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=3067.54s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5589.699s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5592.801s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Rowe, and I appreciate everybody who spoke tonight from the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5599.716s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the web of BJ's related individuals and constituents and those representing the constituents local to this site as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5610.362s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think my fellow Councilors who have kind of spoken and in summation, I think they've put it well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5616.405s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This has been a pretty long road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5618.006s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Most of this happened before I took office last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5620.808s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And, you know, I just wanna acknowledge the community of neighbors that have lived through the nuisances created by BJ's sometimes for decades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5629.78s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sure that if I don't I don't live in the Wellington neighborhood I live in South Medford but I'm sure if I was one of those neighbors I would also have the, I'll believe it when I see it kind of attitude that we're hearing I think that's really understandable I think that's really justified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5642.748s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, this is, I think the context is helpful here, the legal context and the very kind of strict parameters that we ultimately have to operate within.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5650.311s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think this situation where we are trying to do the least harm overall and end up with the best outcome possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5658.253s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And again, that's very constrained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5662.855s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5665.33s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've gotten to a place where this special permit application is now attached to a whole slate of mitigating and improving conditions that is broadened, even from what was looked at two years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5678.716s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's my hope that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5680.345s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, this process, while unfortunate, you know, it's the type of thing, as Councilor Scarpelli said, I wish that we never had to go through this version of this special permit review process in the first place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5693.108s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But it's my hope that we've been able to use this to negotiate the best possible terms under which this gas station might come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5700.59s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I appreciate that investment, that renewed and increased investment that has been proposed for all the work done to create that and for all the work ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5709.209s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, and, um, you know, it's to the constituents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5713.052s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, I want all the residents of this neighborhood to know that if this goes forward, you know, of course, we'll be holding BJ's accountable to its promises to be a good neighbor going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5724.28s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6909.157s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Partially an attempt to see if we can get Attorney Austin back on the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6912.76s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have shared the same concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6914.241s">[Kit Collins]</a>: She can't come back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6928.234s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well, fair enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6928.854s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In that case, I mean, questions I'd love to have answered by somebody with a JD is, it's my impression that this application to have special early, it's not similar to BJ's in that it's opening at 5 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6944.564s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's not allowed by right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6947.266s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That said, you know, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6950.989s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't have a legal degree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6953.82s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In an ideal world, I would love for this council to be able to stand up for organized labor in Medford by saying, you know, why don't you follow through on those great rhetorical commitments to the value of your employees by collectively bargaining with them, and then we'll see if, you know, you can open your store.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6971.246s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Earlier enough that, you know, for example, it's harder to get here in public transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6974.367s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think these are all conditions for why it's especially important to have an organized labor force in such an establishment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6981.137s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That being said, this is a quagmire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6984.479s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we'd like to know that beforehand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6987.54s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So something along the lines of if we have the time to table to our next regular meeting or to the waiting period, those are motions that I'd be in favor of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=656.691s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you very much, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=659.294s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Myself and others in the Medford Arts community received word just a week or two ago that there is a planned opening for Arts Collaborative Medford's very long-planned, long-anticipated community arts center sometime later this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=674.429s">[Kit Collins]</a>: At this point, it's looking like it's going to be in the spring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=677.332s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This has been the product of years and years and years of work and effort on the part of many in Medford's arts community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=686.434s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As a working artist myself, you know it's hard to overstate how important it is to have a community art center actually within our city limits, it's, it's very hard to find.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=697.238s">[Kit Collins]</a>: space for arts, for community arts within our communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=700.462s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These spaces are really scarce, they're really precious, they really mean a lot to artists working in all types of media.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=706.248s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm really excited to see what this can do to leverage a very rich existing arts community in Medford and I just want to wish a very hearty congratulations to everybody who's worked on this project so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1496.054s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, president Rowland.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1497.074s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I really appreciate the discussion around this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1500.258s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, we all get the emails and the calls when we, you know, usually it's around the big sweep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1504.761s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And, you know, I think it's an issue that I'd be really happy if there was a way for the city administration to look at what can we do short term and what can we do long term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1515.329s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I got a call a couple months ago from a constituent who, real recent resident, I think they live in South Medford, just like I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1523.895s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And they said, you know, I just didn't know my car got towed and it was like her whole paycheck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1528.877s">[Kit Collins]</a>: know, of course, a lot of people have had that experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1531.059s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's not a one-off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1532.82s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, I hope that she was able to, you know, bounce back from that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1536.623s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But, you know, that's the type of thing that I think we have a lot of conversations about and ultimately want to insulate our residents from that kind of penalty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1542.767s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think people want to do the right thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1545.049s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I, you know, of course, we're, we sit behind this rail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1547.911s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1548.592s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're not policy implementers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1549.933s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Like, I don't know how to do the DPW's job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1551.694s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Certainly don't know how to do<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1553.151s">[Kit Collins]</a>: our city staff's job, but I'd really love for this to, whether it's through this resolution, follow-up meeting, you know, either or, I think that this is something that I'd really love to discuss with city administration, just to say, you know, what can we do so that we're bridging that gap?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1565.963s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Because I think we see the patterns where there are residents, as Councilor Bears says, there are residents who have been on the email list all along, they get the phone calls, and then there are folks who just, they don't know what they don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1579.38s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that ideally would be part of a revamped communication strategy, but I'd love it if we could do as much as we could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=1587.109s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=2377.907s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=2378.828s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this is bringing up a topic that has been brought up innumerable times by, I don't know how many Councilors in the past, probably all of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=2385.592s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm really not sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=2386.353s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And, you know, as we're all aware, we still are receiving, we're hearing from residents who are experiencing a level of noise pollution from airport traffic that is disruptive to their daily lives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=2402.885s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The background on why these air transit navigation changes<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=2408.915s">[Kit Collins]</a>: happened and when they happened and why that's now causing additional trouble for certain neighborhoods in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=2414.518s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's all on the city website because it's something that branches of our government have been active in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=2428.313s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is just a following up on some of those recent efforts to follow up on promises that have been made by our federal delegation and the federal agencies that they're trying to work with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=2439.096s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Unfortunately, we are many, many steps removed from the people with the power to affect the navigation changes from Boston Logan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=2447.417s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That could get some relief for our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=2451.617s">[Kit Collins]</a>: but we have to stay on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=2454.418s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One short term step that we can take is just to follow up with that federal delegation and say, where are we at with the FAA reviewing these recommendations that include potential solutions for dispersing this noise pollution and go from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=2467.421s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And if constituents who aren't already very active in lodging noise complaints would like to do so, there's a lot of information on how to do so on the city website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=2475.844s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If you go to airplane noise, there's a couple, there's a few options for where to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=2480.479s">[Kit Collins]</a>: register specific complaints that these all get compiled and eventually make them what make their way to the decision makers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=2487.604s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=2488.404s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3198.411s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3200.272s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell, and I just want to thank Councilor Scarpelli for putting this forward and for your words in describing the intent behind this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3207.495s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that, you know, what I feel that the community is looking for is for this whole Medford City government to work together<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3217.242s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to improve the lives of specifically students and those who work in the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3221.445s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And, you know, isn't that the goal of government in general?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3224.808s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I see this as a really, just a great way to start off the year saying, you know, we're partners in this, we're equal partners, let's strike the right tone, let's have a collaborative meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3234.615s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We all want the same things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3236.317s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What do you need?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3238.278s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And what can we do to support you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3239.399s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know from some informal conversations with members of the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3243.341s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This process of saying, here's what we need to create the school environment that our students really deserve and then hearing back a number that's different process that's baked into the school committee here, you know, better than I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3257.127s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And if we can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3259.028s">[Kit Collins]</a>: help shore up, making sure that we get as close as possible to having NPS have what they need to provide the environment that students deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=3269.495s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a great tone to start out the year with, and I really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=6258.003s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Rowe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=6258.803s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for being here and for this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=6261.655s">[Kit Collins]</a>: found the presentation really interesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=6263.136s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's great to hear about a playground from bonafide playground experts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=6266.338s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I really appreciate you walking us through this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=6269.839s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, as Councilor Scarpelli and others have noted, our requests are appropriated by the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=6274.562s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Our vote tonight is, you know, largely symbolic, but I'm really glad that we have the opportunity to do so because this is just, you know, such an inspiring project, really.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=6282.786s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I mean, the need for rehabilitation, you laid it out very clearly, and we're so clearly going beyond that to create a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=6290.129s">[Kit Collins]</a>: adaptive and inclusive space, some of the concepts that we love to talk a lot about how to work those into our public spaces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=6296.335s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And this is just such a such a clear example of us, putting that manifesting that in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=6301.781s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'll be really proud to have this playground within men first borders and thank you for your work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35lad50Uazc&t=6771.611s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would motion that then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=370.315s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1706.373s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1772.28s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=1840.335s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2096.626s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=2263.57s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4211.496s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Penny, for being here tonight and for presenting, you know, some of the process and progress that's gone into the work that this grant has enabled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4219.101s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think, you know, over the past year, this grant, I mean, I know it's gone on for more than the past year, but, you know, what's come out of this has been one of the things that I, you know, feel most proud of in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4229.067s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's really great to be able to see some first steps towards language equity, doing a better job of reaching out to the people who, you know, historically do not show up to City Hall,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4238.154s">[Kit Collins]</a>: are not reached out to, don't speak the language, you know, in whatever way, I think this is really important work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4242.997s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it's great to get sort of these concrete facts about what specifically has been done, what the grant has enabled the city to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4250.24s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that it's important for us to get a picture of what doing that work of bringing more of the community into community spaces, how that breaks down into roles and positions and programs, kind of gives those numbers some context.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4265.466s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, as a, as a Councilor, and I know that you in your office, you, you, you get this, you know, 10 times more than, than we do, but, you know, we hear from people looking for housing, we hear from people who are looking for pro bono legal representation, you know, the eviction crisis in Medford square several months ago, eviction help, you know, tenant organizing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4283.34s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm been very involved with the mutual aid network for several years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4286.122s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, I, what strikes me every time these conversations come up is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4290.461s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It seems like over and over again, we hit against the fact that even our provider network are very close to hitting their bandwidth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4298.743s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know that it's in my mind so strongly all the time that our regional network of providers is inundated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4308.625s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's so much need, you said for housing, food insecurity, there's so much need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4312.366s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know that that's one of the many things that we need a regional approach for, we need more state assistance for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4318.908s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Where this comes in as I think,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4320.558s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Given that it's so important for us to streamline on the local level as much as possible to make sure that everybody in our community who needs those resources can access them in an easy way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4329.322s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this program is doing that and that everybody in the community can have equitable access to the resources that are available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4335.745s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I really hope that that work can continue in parallel with, you know, regionally and with our other providers working to make sure that we have more places to direct people to, you know, I'm sure it's heartbreaking for your staff every time you have to say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4349.366s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I can get you on that wait list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4350.426s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I can get you on that list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4351.507s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I can't wait.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4352.007s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I can't get you on that wait list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4353.107s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm sure that's, I'm sure that's really hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4355.348s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I just thank you for, thank you for this work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4357.349s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm really excited to see how it continues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=4358.949s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And like vice president Behr said, so any way this council can support you and continue that work, you know, we're partners with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5659.556s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanted to thank you for coming before us for having these numbers prepared and for your candor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5664.038s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we all know that when you took the job here, you didn't sign up for a cakewalk, but we all know how much is on your plates with catching up from our financial backlog, reconciling everything, and we don't want<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5679.025s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, your, your role in, in, in getting us up to speed to be any more, you know, painful than it has to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5685.269s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm hoping that, you know, I'm looking forward to the presentation in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5688.211s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I really appreciate, you know, your help in dialing down how to get us what we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5692.595s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I hope that, you know, at that presentation and the committee of the whole, if we refer it there, we can also at that point kind of assess what do we need going forward to make sure that this back and forth between the council and your offices, you know, having communication wise, what it needs,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5706.817s">[Kit Collins]</a>: just to make sure that that's as streamlined as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5708.699s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So again, thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5710.48s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We do really appreciate your hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5825.808s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7294.493s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7296.434s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, mostly right now, I want to, I know there are community members in the room, I want to hear<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7301.169s">[Kit Collins]</a>: from community members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7303.551s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I just wanted to say at the outset, you know, yesterday's incident was heartbreaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7308.394s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's traumatizing during an already extremely raw and difficult time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7316.219s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These events affect the whole community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7318.801s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As leaders, I think it's our responsibility to hear from people who are the most affected, the students, the families, teachers, and staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7324.705s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we can all agree, nothing is more important than our public schools being safe and stable and supportive<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7331.007s">[Kit Collins]</a>: everybody who has to be inside of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7332.648s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's a really shared goal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7335.529s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think this heartbreak is shared that our schools are not safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7340.151s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They're not secure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7341.072s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They don't feel supportive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7343.053s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And, you know, in this conversation, you know, I want to hear from the people most affected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7347.355s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's the folks who go to the schools every day and the people who love them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7351.857s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As we mentioned, you know, many Councilors, myself included, have papers later on the agenda for ways that this council can act within its power to try and be part of the solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7361.372s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll get into more of that later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7364.693s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's deeply troubling that we have to be having this conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7369.296s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's hard to put into words how to express sympathy for something so painful that's happened to kids just going to school and their families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7379.161s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's a sorry thing, the events that precipitated this discussion, but we have to have it and we're gonna have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7386.865s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli and others were calling for urgent action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7390.199s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're calling for the council to act within its purview to try and be part of the solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7393.841s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I completely agree, completely agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7398.283s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, we have to use our powers as city councilors to try and be part of the solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7402.265s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We aren't the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7404.286s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We can't be the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7405.887s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We can't make the type of the decisions that the school community is empowered to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7410.029s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We can use the powers that we have as the city council to try to direct resources where they need to go to try to be a part of the community-wide conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7417.628s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to emphasize the voices of the folks that are most affected by this, to listen to the people who know best where those resources need to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7424.231s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm glad that we get to be a part of that conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7426.992s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I hope that going forward, this can be more collaborative, that we can all do our specific roles, but in concert with each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7435.715s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And lastly, since Councilor Scarpelli's resolution calls for public input, if anybody's here to give input, I just want to acknowledge that not everybody does feel comfortable speaking in public, especially on live TV.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7445.68s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's not for the faint of heart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7447.356s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And also not every comment, especially when kids and school security is involved, is best said in a public setting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7454.543s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanna restate for the record, whether we're in session or not, I'm available to any resident, to any constituent to field ideas, to hear your questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7465.213s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If you just need a listening ear, if you don't feel comfortable speaking tonight, you can always reach out to me, we're available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7473.218s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I just wanted to say that at the outset of any community input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7477.341s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9175.618s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9176.518s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm speaking off the cuff here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9178.819s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I just want to say, you know, I think that what the community deserves today in the aftermath of yesterday's events, in the aftermath of other traumatic, tragic events, what the community deserves is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9194.111s">[Kit Collins]</a>: a communicative, collaborative city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9199.876s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They deserve clear communication, resolve to work together productively from all their elected leaders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9207.843s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We owe our community better than infighting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9210.386s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, we've disagreed on many things many times before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9214.389s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Behind this rail, it'll happen again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9217.292s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's what we're here to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9219.332s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're here to represent different viewpoints for perspective on issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9222.973s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're here to represent different viewpoints for how to, how to craft strategy and how to respond to problems in our community and how to plan for the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9231.094s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think that we owe today, especially today and all days, we owe the community a productive use of our time, discussing available strategies for what we can do within our powers to try to deal with the problems before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9246.478s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9248.973s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What, what looks like a buzzword to one Councilor might be somebody else's best good faith, earnest approach at doing something that is within our power, within our purview to try to address specifically a problem that exists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9265.717s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's put forth in good faith.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9267.018s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that tracks both ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9268.478s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think it's productive for us to launch into<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9274.321s">[Kit Collins]</a>: veiled personal attacks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9275.682s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, I don't want, I don't want that to be what tonight is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9279.184s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that we have to come together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9280.846s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have to discuss the strategies that we've put forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9283.367s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We might not agree on all of them, but what our community is calling out for is a good faith, earnest discussion of strategies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9290.372s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It does our community no good to spill a lot of ink and spill a lot of airtime, fighting about things that we cannot control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9300.88s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The community deserves better than a performance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9303.223s">[Kit Collins]</a>: we need to discuss strategies that we have the capacity to enforce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9307.105s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And sometimes we will disagree about what those best strategies are, but that's what our time should be for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9311.666s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I have a rationale for why I brought the strategies that I think are most important to talk about here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9317.669s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know those feelings aren't universally shared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9319.85s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll save that for when those papers are brought up, but I really hope that we can maintain<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9325.708s">[Kit Collins]</a>: clear communication and sticking to the issues at hand and striving for concrete strategies for as much of this evening as possible, because that's what the community needs from us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9333.399s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12246.495s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12247.856s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, I it's, it's hard to add anything after a story like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12251.239s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't have anything to add.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12252.12s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanted to thank you for, for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12254.021s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for sharing your story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12256.402s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm not a parent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12257.182s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I can't fathom what it's like to be a parent and go through something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12260.183s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Something that unfortunately a lot of families in our public school systems have to go through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12264.144s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's heartbreaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12264.885s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just want to say, you know, our hearts go out to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=12266.725s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15116.556s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15159.33s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15180.457s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you very much, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15182.439s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Tonight is the third night of the holiday Hanukkah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15185.321s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I hope my colleagues will join me in wishing a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15187.734s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Chag Sameach or happy holiday to all who celebrate this holiday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15191.936s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Celebrates the legend of an oil candle that burned in probably for eight whole nights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15196.597s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think tonight we can celebrate the miracle of a hypothetical candle that burned for a probably five hour city council meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15202.499s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15256.419s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15310.523s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15377.039s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15431.086s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15432.407s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just to keep it very brief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15433.528s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a project that I've already discussed with the director of PBS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15437.11s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This came about because of my involvement in the Solid Waste Task Force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15440.072s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They thought that an ordinance to this effect would help further the overall goals of the task force and further streamline<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15447.231s">[Kit Collins]</a>: standards and operations for all waste haulers in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15450.292s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They've already indicated that draft language is available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15453.853s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'd move approval for referring this into subcommittee for further study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15486.825s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15562.518s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15645.403s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15762.67s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15907.472s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3852.361s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Penny, for being here tonight and for presenting, you know, some of the process and progress that's gone into the work that this grant has enabled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3859.967s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think, you know, over the past year, this grant, I mean, I know it's gone on for more than the past year, but you know, what's come out of this has been one of the things that I, you know, feel most proud of in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3869.935s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's really<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3871.024s">[Kit Collins]</a>: great to be able to see some first steps towards language equity, doing a better job of reaching out to the people who, you know, historically do not show up to city hall or not reached out to don't speak the language, you know, in whatever way, I think this is really important work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3883.874s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, and it's great to get sort of these concrete facts about what specifically has been done, what the grant has been, has enabled the city to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3891.84s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, I think that it's important for us to get a picture of what, um, doing that, doing that work of bringing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3897.22s">[Kit Collins]</a>: more of the community into community spaces, how that breaks down into roles and positions and programs, kind of gives those numbers some context.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3906.643s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As a Councilor, and I know that you in your office, you get this 10 times more than we do, but we hear from people looking for housing, we hear from people who are looking for pro bono legal representation, the eviction crisis in Medford Square several months ago, eviction help, tenant organizing,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3924.197s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've been very involved with the mutual aid network for several years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3928.02s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What strikes me every time these conversations come up is it seems like over and over again, we hit against the fact that even our provider network are very close to hitting their bandwidth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3939.631s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3942.487s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's in my mind so strongly all the time that our regional network of providers is inundated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3949.49s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's so much need, you said for housing, food insecurity, there's so much need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3953.231s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know that that's one of the many things that we need a regional approach for, we need more state assistance for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3959.773s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Where this comes in as I think, given that it's so important for us to streamline on the local level as much as possible to make sure that everybody in our community who needs those resources can access them in an easy way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3970.752s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this program is doing that and that everybody in the community can have equitable access to the resources that are available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3976.597s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I really hope that that work can continue in parallel with regionally and with our other providers working to make sure that we have more places to direct people to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3986.305s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sure it's heartbreaking for your staff every time you have to say, I can get you on that wait list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3991.309s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I can get you on that list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3992.39s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I can't get you on that wait list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3993.991s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm sure that's really hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3997.303s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just thank you for this work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3998.223s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm really excited to see how it continues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3999.824s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And like vice president Baird said, so anyway, this council can support you and continue that work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4005.126s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're partners with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5300.421s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanted to thank you for coming for us, for having these numbers prepared and for your candor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5304.903s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we all know that when you took the job here, you didn't sign up for a cakewalk, but we all know how much is on your plates with catching up from our financial backlog, reconciling everything, and we don't want<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5319.898s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, your role in getting us up to speed to be any more, you know, painful than it has to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5326.143s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm hoping that, you know, I'm looking forward to the presentation in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5329.086s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I really appreciate, you know, your help in dialing down how to get us what we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5333.47s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I hope that, you know, at that presentation and the committee of the whole, if we refer it there, we can also at that point kind of assess what do we need going forward to make sure that this back and forth between the council and your offices, you know, having communication-wise what it needs<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5347.689s">[Kit Collins]</a>: just to make sure that that's as streamlined as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5349.57s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So again, thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5350.81s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We do really appreciate your hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6935.352s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6936.833s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, you know, mostly right now, I, I want to, I know there are community members in the room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6940.934s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to hear from community members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6943.735s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, but I just wanted to say at the outset, you know, yesterday's incident was heartbreaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6950.418s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's traumatizing during an already extremely raw and difficult time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6955.42s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, these events affect the whole community as leaders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6960.242s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's our responsibility to hear from people who are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6962.997s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the most affected, the students, the families, teachers and staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6965.579s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we can all agree nothing is more important than our public schools being safe and stable and supportive for everybody who has to be inside of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6973.525s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's a really shared goal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6976.407s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think this heartbreak is shared that our schools are not safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6981.031s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They're not secure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6981.952s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They don't feel supportive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6983.913s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And, you know, in this conversation,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6986.388s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, I want to hear from the people most affected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6988.229s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's the folks who go to the schools every day and the people who love them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6992.73s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As, as we mentioned, you know, many Councilors, myself included, have papers later on the agenda for ways that this council can act within its power to try and be part of the solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7001.734s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, we'll, we'll get into more of that later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7004.555s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's, it's deeply troubling that we have to be having this conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7008.476s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm just, it's, it's hard to put into words, you know, how to express sympathy for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7015.43s">[Kit Collins]</a>: something so painful that's happened to kids just going to school and their families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7020.051s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's, you know, it's a sorry thing, the events that precipitated this discussion, but we have to have it and we're gonna have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7027.413s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, Councilor Scarpelli and others were calling for urgent action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7031.054s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're calling for the council to act within its purview to try and be part of the solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7035.596s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I completely agree, completely agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7039.157s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, we have to use our powers as city councilors to try and be part of the solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7043.138s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We aren't the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7045.147s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We can't be the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7046.748s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We can't make the type of the decisions that the school committee is empowered to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7050.89s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We can use the powers that we have as the city council to try to direct resources where they need to go, to try to be a part of the community-wide conversation, to emphasize the voices of the folks that are most affected by this, to listen to the people who know best where those resources need to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7065.118s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm glad that we get to be a part of that conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7067.88s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I hope that going forward, this can be more collaborative<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7072.073s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that we can all do our specific roles, but in concert with each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7075.415s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And lastly, since Councilor Scarpelli's resolution calls for public input, if anybody's here to give input, I just want to acknowledge that not everybody does feel comfortable speaking in public, especially on live TV.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7086.52s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's not for the faint of heart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7088.221s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And also not every comment, especially when kids and school security is involved, is best said in a public setting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7095.425s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just want to restate for the record, whether we're in session or not, I'm available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7100.899s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to any resident, to any constituent, to field ideas, to hear your questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7106.083s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If you just need a listening ear, if you don't feel comfortable speaking tonight, you can always reach out to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7112.149s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7114.09s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I just wanted to say that at the outset of any community input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7118.234s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8816.498s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8817.518s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm speaking off the cuff here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8819.72s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I just wanna say, I think that what the community deserves<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8825.088s">[Kit Collins]</a>: today in the aftermath of yesterday's events, in the aftermath of other traumatic, tragic events.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8831.45s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What the community deserves is a communicative, collaborative city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8840.752s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They deserve clear communication, resolve to work together productively from all their elected leaders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8848.714s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We owe our community better than infighting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8851.234s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, we've disagreed on many things many times before,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8855.258s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Behind this rail, it'll happen again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8858.139s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's what we're here to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8860.2s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're here to represent different viewpoints for perspective on issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8863.841s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're here to represent different viewpoints for how to craft strategy and how to respond to problems in our community and how to plan for the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8871.964s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think that we owe today, especially today and all days, we owe the community a productive use of our time, discussing available strategies for what we can do within our powers<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8884.502s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to try to deal with the problems before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8887.364s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I, you know, what, what looks like a buzzword to one Councilor might be somebody else's best good faith, earnest approach at doing something that is within our power, within our purview to try to address specifically a problem that exists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8906.596s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's put forth in good faith.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8907.897s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that tracks both ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8909.358s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think it's productive for us to launch into<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8915.19s">[Kit Collins]</a>: veiled personal attacks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8918.232s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't want that to be what tonight is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8919.833s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that we have to come together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8921.715s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have to discuss the strategies that we've put forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8924.236s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We might not agree on all of them, but what our community is calling out for is a good faith, earnest discussion of strategies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8931.241s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It does our community no good to spill a lot of ink and spill a lot of airtime, fighting about things that we cannot control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8941.749s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The community deserves better than a performance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8944.091s">[Kit Collins]</a>: we need to discuss strategies that we have the capacity to enforce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8947.973s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And sometimes we will disagree about what those best strategies are, but that's what our time should be for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8952.536s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I have a rationale for why I brought the strategies that I think are most important to talk about here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8958.539s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know those feelings aren't universally shared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8960.72s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll save that for when those papers are brought up, but I really hope that we can maintain just<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8966.579s">[Kit Collins]</a>: clear communication and sticking to the issues at hand and striving for concrete strategies for as much of this evening as possible, because that's what the community needs from us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8974.284s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11887.377s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11888.718s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, I, it's, it's hard to add anything after a story like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11892.12s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't have anything to add.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11893.001s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanted to thank you for, for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11894.882s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for sharing your story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11896.739s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, I'm not a parent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11898.04s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I can't fathom what it's like to be a parent and go through something like that, something that unfortunately a lot of families in our public school systems have to go through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11905.024s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's heartbreaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11905.745s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just want to say, you know, our hearts go out to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11907.586s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14821.331s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you very much, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14823.292s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Tonight is the third night of the holiday Hanukkah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14826.174s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I hope my colleagues will join me in wishing a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14828.612s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Chag Sameach or happy holiday to all who celebrate this holiday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14832.796s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Celebrates the legend of an oil candle that burned in probably for eight whole nights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14837.48s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think tonight we can celebrate the miracle of a hypothetical candle that burned for a probably five hour city council meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14843.366s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=15071.96s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=15073.0s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just to keep it very brief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=15074.401s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a project that I've already discussed with the director of PBS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=15077.984s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This came about because of my involvement in the solid waste task force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=15080.946s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They thought that an ordinance to this effect would help further the overall goals of the task force and further streamline<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=15088.121s">[Kit Collins]</a>: standards and operations for all waste haulers in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=15091.163s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They've already indicated that draft language is available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=15094.725s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'd move approval for referring this into subcommittee for further study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1540.348s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3240.183s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3242.064s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3244.796s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thanks, Owen, for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3246.116s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My question is also about sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3249.197s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If the sidewalk mitigation is rolled into the same project by Eversource or their contractor, I was just curious if you had a quick status update on your fingertips.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3258.719s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If not, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3259.459s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was hearing from constituents who were dealing with sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3282.61s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that'll start in the spring?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3293.955s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3294.376s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are there any interim measures for folks on wheelchairs, strollers, with those missing chunks in the meantime?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3308.215s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sure, totally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3308.775s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I understand that added up a bunch of full-time jobs to the DPW's roster.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3313.357s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm just curious, are there added crosswalks just to maintain ADA compliance while all that's been worked out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3330.823s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But that'll happen in the spring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3344.944s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So it'll look the same, but it's just temporary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3348.045s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, gotcha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3348.626s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Essentially what I'm trying to get at is for folks who can't hop over an uneven sidewalk through the winter, do they have recourse right now or is it avoid that sidewalk and toll?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3357.931s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3359.952s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Where in particular are you talking?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3362.073s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'd have to reference my inbox.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3363.514s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4449.774s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morella.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4450.835s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Fellow dog lover here, for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4453.898s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I find myself agreeing with a lot of what Councilor Scarpelli has to offer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4457.643s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also took note of the survey when it was released.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4460.706s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My first thought was just similar to the ARPA Community Survey in general.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4466.373s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In the community, when we see a survey go out, I'm very curious to know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4471.355s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What's the plan for the survey?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4473.938s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What is the goal for how many people to be surveyed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4476.441s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What is the process for making sure that we get a representative cross section of the community actually weighing in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4482.442s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Will that be reported?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4484.043s">[Kit Collins]</a>: How will that feedback be translated into policy with this issue in particular because it involves an ordinance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4490.547s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would love advanced notice from the administration on if we are to try to craft or change policy based on the feedback from this ordinance, how will that go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4500.133s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Especially since that is a multi-jurisdictional event because of the ordinance involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4511.236s">[Kit Collins]</a>: there was one more thing that I had to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4514.077s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But it's left my mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4515.717s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, you know, in general, I think that I think that Councilor Scarpelli's point about the bandwidth of our animal control specialists as well as our communications bandwidth is really a point well taken that applies to most things in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4529.16s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that when we do put out a survey, especially knowing that it's an issue that constituents are looking to hear about, I think that we need to be proactive about managing expectations, both for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4540.303s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the timetable on which things are proposed to maybe change and also the scope that it's possible to change things within.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4547.445s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And again, especially that's relevant here because it would involve city council action as well as administrative action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4552.947s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think that in many cases, that's really lacking when this sort of, we're just putting feelers out there type of action gets done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4560.09s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's really, we owe it to the community to let them know, we wanna hear your feedback and also this is the universe of possibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4566.992s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=5670.906s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Rao.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=5672.186s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate all of the resident comments on this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=5676.829s">[Kit Collins]</a>: At the end of the day, I'm not even overly concerned about a quick change to our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=5685.123s">[Kit Collins]</a>: dog free range policy precipitating here in Medford because honestly, I think Mr. Lincoln said, and if you didn't, I apologize for putting words in your mouth, why put out a survey at all based on the resident impact, that input that we've received so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=5698.051s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We know why they're putting out a survey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=5700.213s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's a way of not having to say in response to resident input,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=5704.745s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Actually, we don't have the operating budget to sustain what you are asking for, and that's why we're not doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=5710.329s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's a way of avoiding making that statement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=5713.171s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that is the conversation that we really need to be having on this and every other important issue facing the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=5721.497s">[Kit Collins]</a>: With that, I would motion for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6657.763s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Roehl, and I appreciate the dialogue so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6661.052s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6664.421s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Like Vice President Bears, I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6666.477s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm glad about the spirit of this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6668.998s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I had similar reservations about doing it by the text offered in the main paper, which the amendment offered, I think I'd be much more comfortable with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6679.001s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that everybody behind this rail, this really feels that frustration of asking for this information over and over and not getting it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6687.584s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And also the frustration of trying to work with KP Law, a lawyer that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6691.895s">[Kit Collins]</a>: is not beholden to us or working exclusively with us and getting extremely variable responses to our requests for legal counsel, which I will not enumerate, but I will if anybody asks me specifically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6706.367s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was going to mention<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6714.442s">[Kit Collins]</a>: well, in the spirit of the amendment that's been offered, I think that, you know, the buck has to stop somewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6719.604s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this is an appropriate next step to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6723.266s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we can, I think we have demonstrated, I think we'll continue to demonstrate to the administration that we are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6729.688s">[Kit Collins]</a>: extremely serious about getting a city solicitor, assistant city solicitor that will be accountable to us for the council to stop all work that requires legal review right here and now before another escalating step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6742.317s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, not to sound overly cynical, but I could see that being a real gift for the administration in the way that goes against what we're trying to do here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6749.282s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Prior to June of this year, you know, we heard multiple times an alleged rationale for why we didn't really need an independent council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6757.128s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The summer we started hearing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6759.886s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6760.106s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6761.227s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Commentary about the fact that we would try to produce two whole ordinances per year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6766.652s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want us to keep making the case that this city council is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6770.135s">[Kit Collins]</a>: By law, a legislative body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6771.817s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We will legislate to create the policies that this community deserves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6775.54s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want us to keep doing that through December.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6778.243s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If we don't get you know the reasonable accommodations that we're asking for, you know, then I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8047.333s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8049.314s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this was a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8050.375s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll be happy to support it tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8051.876s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just to echo what Vice President Bears was just speaking to, you know, I think that as we try to improve the status quo with parking in our community, among other issues, you know, I keep coming back to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8068.481s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What were they set up to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8070.123s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Were they set up to succeed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8071.224s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Were they set up to fail?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8073.026s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that these traveling information sessions is a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8076.349s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Actually, just earlier this week, I was talking to a constituent who actually didn't hear about the big sweep, which is something that even I hear about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8084.438s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I feel like I'm the last person I know about everything in the community, notwithstanding being a council member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8090.804s">[Kit Collins]</a>: To me, that speaks to the fact that we can do as much as we're doing right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8094.17s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We can try to reach as many people as possible with our current communications infrastructure and staffing levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8099.579s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are, it's reality, we're missing a lot of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8103.765s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is going to help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8105.569s">[Kit Collins]</a>: but it's not a systemic approach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8106.949s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I really want to see the city administration supporting the parking department and rolling out these traveling information sessions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8116.192s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No department crafts its own policies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8118.633s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These are directives that are coming down from the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8120.634s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If the administration wants this department to succeed, they need to help them succeed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8124.955s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this is a great tactic to advance that, but it needs resources and it needs support just like the rest of their agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8131.297s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9976.852s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for being here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9978.939s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also want to open by apologizing for not speaking up last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9984.128s">[Kit Collins]</a>: when you came before us and briefly shared your story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9987.99s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This case is very deeply troubling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9990.791s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And honestly, I felt at a loss for what I could offer that in that moment would possibly help given how limited this body is and what it can do to directly impact this or any other situation in public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10003.636s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was distracted by a sense of regret that this issue even had to come so far as to be brought up in a public meeting and risk further pain and exposure for everybody involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10014.428s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I apologize, this is state of my mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10016.289s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've had the opportunity to speak with you privately and thank you for giving me your time and your perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10020.67s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In reflecting, I've remembered that even in the absence of a new good idea to lend to a problem or some idea for an instant fix, which there isn't here, simply expressing sympathy can be a good start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10034.095s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sorry that I didn't offer that last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10036.575s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So for all the families who listen to these meetings, for your family, for all the families who invest in our public schools, I am sorry for my silence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10044.72s">[Kit Collins]</a>: COVID was no excuse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10046.201s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If I wasn't well enough to respond to a resident in need, I should have already been logged off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10050.624s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's just something for me to take forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10053.826s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Like I've said, I'm deeply troubled by what your family and these students have been through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10058.707s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sad that we have to go so far in giving each student what they need to have a safe and stable experience at school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10064.772s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Every student needs to be able to count on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10066.714s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We owe that to our public school students and their families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10070.517s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Knight and Councilor Scarpelli, I appreciate the sincere attempt to create a solve for this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10074.941s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's a policy that will improve conditions in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10078.564s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Talk is cheap, we all know this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10080.125s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Roles change hands, policy is an expression of values.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10084.689s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That being said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10086.67s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to support policies that will help to effectuate direct impact that this body can enforce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10097.977s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't love to share this, but I'm not comfortable supporting the main papers tonight as written.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10102.259s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do want to share why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10104.361s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I believe this proposed ordinance, I share similar concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10107.863s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I believe it would conflict with national law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10109.644s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I believe it would be unenforceable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10112.406s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I believe that we need to pay<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10114.787s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Deep attention to resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10116.028s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Hold our administration accountable to following through on resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10118.649s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A public forum is deeply important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10121.23s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't know that we can enforce that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10122.67s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that we owe our students and our teachers and our school staff more resources to create the environment that our students deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10130.899s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In the interest of avoiding a conflict with mass general law, I feel unable to support this paper as written.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10138.122s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I believe that we can hold school leadership accountable to our shared goals while also maintaining checks and balances in our city government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10144.784s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's not to say that I don't support changes to school policy that would arm our school administration and school staff with better systems and tools to prevent school violence and create the best possible experience for our students and our public schools families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10157.673s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just don't believe that this is something that we can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10159.835s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that our teachers, our school staff, our school committee want what is best for our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10165.02s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that we need, and I think that most of them would agree, that policy changes and resource changes to improve the condition and the environment of our schools, ensuring the best possible environment for kids to learn and thrive in safely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10178.393s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have to effectuate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10181.487s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that the B paper offered by Councilor, Vice President Bears is one piece of an overall puzzle of aligning resources with our values.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10191.097s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'd be happy to support that tonight and continue the discussion about the main paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10196.122s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bm5-jrZInBw&t=1839.348s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Kit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bm5-jrZInBw&t=1842.449s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Hi there, my name is Kit Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bm5-jrZInBw&t=1844.09s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm on the Medford City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bm5-jrZInBw&t=1845.531s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm a member of the Solid Waste Task Force<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bm5-jrZInBw&t=1847.827s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Apologies for being off camera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bm5-jrZInBw&t=1849.468s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm recovering from COVID right now, so not looking my best, but really glad to see so many people on the call tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Bm5-jrZInBw&t=1854.272s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=570.148s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=571.068s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The Housing Subcommittee met again to discuss the proposed Housing Stability Notification Ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=576.51s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We had a robust discussion with relevant city staff regarding enforcement and implementation, and we referred it to Committee of the Whole to continue the discussion with other councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1778.251s">[Kit Collins]</a>: President Merle and I motioned a table, so that we can we can take this up in person at a subsequent meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4756.751s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4757.711s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just since you asked for confirmation, I just wanted to offer mine, what I heard from the chief of staff at our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4763.65s">[Kit Collins]</a>: meeting was that I say, I believe that they said they were looking for feedback, an opportunity for feedback from the city council on these projects, but that they had, the executive office has full jurisdiction to go ahead with the appropriations and that they do not need our vote to complete them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6134.549s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6136.37s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And thank you to Chief Friedman, Director Morrison, and I wanna say project manager, Jim Silva.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6143.151s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I apologize if I got your title wrong, but it's great to see you working in the city hall in any capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6149.693s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I definitely, as one councilor, I definitely appreciate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6153.063s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the clarity and the context around these funding requests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6161.508s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Now that we've heard a little bit about each of them, you know, I would be happy to make a motion to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6167.881s">[Kit Collins]</a>: them all or frankly to just receive and place on file, the Chief of Staff made it clear that our votes of approval on these appropriations were not necessary for funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6181.305s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm not sure if there is a procedural difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6186.086s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But, you know, I think that this is, you know, in a best case scenario, this could be a forum for meaningful feedback on the work of these departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6198.929s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't know that we've really seen that play out in our ARPA allocation process so far, which, you know, I think is a part of the allocation process where there's a bit of potential that I hope we can see used a little bit better as we continue to go on and continue to spend down our disbursement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6216.673s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would like for the community to have meaningful input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6218.974s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would like for this council to have meaningful input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6220.974s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's not to say that there's anything I'd really like to critique about the projects before us right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6229.757s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These are projects that are being advocated for by the city department heads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6234.438s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's not up to us how ARPA is spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6237.979s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so for the purposes of this meeting,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6241.4s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's good enough for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6242.242s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that there's a forum for getting more information about each of these projects in particular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6247.775s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But frankly, I'm not sure that this is it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6250.45s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that the administration wants to let it be known, you know, some of these big buckets that some of our ARPA money is going to be, is considered being committed towards at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6263.22s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, message heard loud and clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6264.701s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6265.361s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's a good start of getting, you know, a bit more on the ball in terms of where those big tracts of our ARPA spending is going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6272.587s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I hope that we can continue to have that level of back and forth and that we can continue to have meaningful input going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6279.071s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But as for now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6280.29s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, you know, I think that continuing to have that broad stroke kind of conversation is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6285.491s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then if there's nitty gritty on implementation, you know, I'd like to have that in a more dedicated setting, um, so that Councilors as well as department heads can be fully equipped to have those kinds, um, of conversations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6300.716s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So with that, I would, I would motion for approval on, on these five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6305.607s">[Kit Collins]</a>: appropriations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6307.228s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I also I apologize if my words are a little garbled tonight, I am on day four COVID right now so not speaking that well but thank you for letting me know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6326.812s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, then I would I would motion to receive in place on file, if that is the case, but I'm open to open to amendment if other Councilors feel differently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=6999.573s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7000.693s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, to echo Councilor Scarpelli's words of support and other Councilors' words of support, just to emphasize, since I didn't earlier, even if we were voting for approval, even if approval were up to us,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7015.366s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would have no hesitation voting for approval for any of these, for any of these suggested expenditures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7023.93s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They heard loud and clear the benefits to our city, our community, to our various departments, the projects that these expenditures will fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7033.354s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't wanna detract from that note of support just because this conversation also brings in sort of the broader threads of,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7043.158s">[Kit Collins]</a>: ARPA's funding in general and how that relates to the overall budget and how that relates to the structural deficit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7049.481s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think the point that I'm trying to make through what I've said is that I think with conversations like this with individual department heads, about individual departments, about individual<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7061.444s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Expenditures, often they become about the operating budget, they become about the structural deficit, they become about the communication that we receive about the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7072.631s">[Kit Collins]</a>: With city staffers who frankly, I don't think it's fair for us to expect to answer to those questions because we're not getting that communication elsewhere in predictable and routine ways from our central administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7086.56s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, I'm always glad for the chance to talk about those things with our department heads and our project leaders, but at the same time, that's not the forum that I want for these conversations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7098.167s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So, you know, I think we can say at the same time, we're concerned about one-time funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7105.692s">[Kit Collins]</a>: being used to fund projects that will then, in a couple years, need another funding source, because maybe somebody knows, but I don't happen to know where that funding will come from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7114.327s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We can say that, and at the same time, we can say, you know, I personally, as one Councilor,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7119.851s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm glad that these projects will be funded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7122.573s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They will be funded because it's up to this administration and the administration, by virtue of the fact that these department heads are here today, they're planning on funding them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7130.422s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I just wanted to make that very clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7131.923s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think there's kind of two levels to this conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7134.586s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They're parallel, but these broader concerns<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7139.035s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in my understanding, don't take away from the fact that these projects are going to get funded unless, you know, the executive office changes its mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7148.242s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And personally, I'm happy about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7151.204s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just to clarify that, and with that, I would move the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=164.889s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell and thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=166.759s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Knight, for your motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=170.322s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this resolution speaks for itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=171.843s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also wanna flag that we have a few representatives of the Resident Assistance Union here tonight to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=181.85s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just to emphasize that this is a call for Tufts University, my alma mater, to voluntarily recognize the union.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=189.036s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We hope that they will do so swiftly as it's the right thing to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=192.078s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3638.217s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell, and I appreciate the discussion around this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3641.899s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also don't want to belabor the points that I made the last time this was on our agenda, but I want to say, you know, I'm sympathetic to some of the other concerns that I'm hearing tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3648.744s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I remember after we, you know, finally passed the budget in June, on July 1st, what was on my mind was fiscal year 24.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3657.11s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, it was, it was so immediately apparent, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3661.647s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Our issues are not behind us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3663.409s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Our budgetary concerns are not behind us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3666.111s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're already kind of staring down the barrel of what we're going to hear about in, you know, hopefully May of next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3671.555s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Hopefully it's not June again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3673.477s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But that being said, you know, like we talked about last month, or like I said last month, you know, to me, I'll be supporting this paper tonight because Medford is experiencing growing pains.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3687.325s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and this position I feel is necessary to help us evolve thoughtfully and appropriately and intentionally and plan for the future that we want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3694.069s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And to me, leaving this position unfilled is leaving opportunity on the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3698.752s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The Planning Development and Sustainability Office is, you know, one of the most productive departments that we have in the city hall for actually increasing revenue for our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3709.279s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Of course, the future is incredibly uncertain and that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3712.2s">[Kit Collins]</a>: creates a lot of anxiety for me and for so many other people who care about this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=3718.104s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I am fearful of what will happen, the opportunities we'll leave on the table, the people that will lose to other communities if we don't create opportunities for growth within our city hierarchy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=5465.101s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=5466.282s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And again, I appreciate all the perspectives being shared on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=5470.446s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I really appreciate this discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=5471.567s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's an important one for the public to hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=5476.111s">[Kit Collins]</a>: To me, kind of in summation, I believe that this council has been doing the work of seeking to change the financial conditions of the city to get us to an environment where all city employees<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=5492.954s">[Kit Collins]</a>: can count on getting raises, can count on being fairly compensated, can count on getting wage increases every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=5499.7s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That is very obviously has been well documented and talked about at great length.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=5506.085s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Not the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=5506.605s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It has not been the case for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=5509.39s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it is truly astonishing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=5510.851s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that all of the city employees who have chosen to remain public servants in light of that is, it's truly astonishing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=5519.057s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's heroic, including many people, I'd say probably in the departments that we've talked about tonight, that they remain committed to this work to serve this community, even as they are going under compensated and without having a light at the end of the tunnel for when that condition is going to change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=5536.992s">[Kit Collins]</a>: At the same time, this body has been doing the work of trying to change the financial conditions so we can get to a place where all workers can be fairly compensated, can count on fair raises every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=5549.677s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I wish that we were seeing more of that type of leadership from the executive office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=5553.699s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In my opinion, we have not been.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=5556.0s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've been doing what we can in our limited jurisdiction to create the conditions for development, to create the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=5563.183s">[Kit Collins]</a>: space and capacity and funding for people who will help us do that development, because at the end of the day, we allocate the resources that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=5571.229s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have been trying to do the work to create more resources to give the people who take care of this community what they deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=5578.995s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think that this is a worker versus worker issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=5585.0s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I hope that the people of Medford, especially those who work for our city, and in many cases, in spite of how the city treats them,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=5593.509s">[Kit Collins]</a>: know that this council stands with them and wants to fight for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=5599.45s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that this particular position is in service of our work to try to better the conditions of the city so that conditions can be better for everybody who works for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=5611.193s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And with that, I'll motion for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=6137.814s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=902.372s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell and thank you Attorney Blake for being here, my, and perhaps we'll get to this in your presentation but my concerns are similar to what Vice President Bears just expressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=913.642s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And in the light of the example of BJS last year that Councilor Scarpelli alluded to I'm curious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=922.808s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are there, with this type of permit application, are there permissible versus non-permissible reasons for denial that we need to know about before we take this vote?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=931.172s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1310.885s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you President real I want to check my understanding here it sounds like from that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1316.675s">[Kit Collins]</a>: description from Attorney Blake that per our zoning ordinance, we can make special exceptions for non-conforming land uses in the case of an exceptional community benefit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1329.501s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But it sounds like the interpretation is in a case such as this, we can't deny a technically conforming land use for a reason that doesn't fit within those bullet points that you mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1343.727s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I just wanna first check that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1346.814s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My understanding is correct there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1417.715s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It does, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2920.037s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion while under suspension to take communications from the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3903.456s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3904.417s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Alicia, for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3905.817s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I support this paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3911.439s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that some of my councilors won't feel heard that I'm saying that, and I regret that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3918.702s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do hear you on this issue in particular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3922.183s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I hear you about the buck has to stop somewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3925.484s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I hear you that we need to find what leverage we can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3928.217s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to get the reports that we have been asking for, to get the level of accountability that we have been asking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3933.681s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I hope you look at my past actions and know that I agree with you and that my metric for what I can support and what affects to our city departments I can condone just happened to be different and that is not personal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3948.513s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In this case, this is not an appropriation from Greek cash that makes a difference to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3954.437s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It already exists within the OPDS budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3957.45s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In addition, you know, I mean, I think that we'd all agree that the, you know, in many ways, the situation here in City Hall is not stable, as Councilor Knight alluded to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3967.993s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, I've spoken to staff in City Hall who, you know, despite their commitment to this community and to public service, they too are feeling the pull to leave, to go to the private sector, to find jobs in other municipalities, because they feel there is no future for them here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3983.587s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No opportunity for growth or promotion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3986.271s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We can't be creating additional reasons for the qualified staff that we do have to leave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3994.603s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, and just circling back to what I feel is the broader issue, you know, to me, the foundational issue, this is, you know, we're a community, putting the HR problems aside, we're going through growing pains.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4004.728s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is the type of work and role that will help us evolve thoughtfully and appropriately and intentionally and plan for the future that we want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4011.031s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't want to hold our future hostage to the problems that we as a body cannot solve on our own.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4019.036s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5344.844s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I found them in order and I move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5557.883s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell, I had the opportunity to meet Steve via the Solid Waste Task Force and I can say he's already very much missed on that body and elsewhere throughout the Metro community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5567.447s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So sending our deepest condolences to his family and many friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5861.599s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5862.419s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just want to note for the record, the parking department is not self-governing any more than any other department in our city, in my view, not any more than the assessor's office, the DPW, or any other department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5875.706s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They've been under a lot of fire since they were established.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5879.328s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm glad that we're flagging resident concerns and that we're making sure that residents are being righted and made whole where appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5886.78s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I just want to make the point that no department is an island.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5889.642s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The administration is responsible for creating the conditions for the parking department's success, same as any other department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5899.11s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These projects are being done at the administration's behest, and so I want to make sure that the administration is being held accountable for these issues that are affecting resident quality of life, and not just the people carrying them out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5911.5s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6159.359s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6161.721s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this is a ballot question that all voters get to vote on on the November ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6167.88s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It would uphold the Work and Family Mobility Act, which passed the legislature this spring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6172.422s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It would ensure that all drivers who can present proof of residency and pass a road test can get a driver's license.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6178.104s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This ensures that all drivers are tested and licensed and insured, which it's demonstrated to make the road safer for everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6185.527s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This bill is also supported by a coalition of law enforcement professionals because it is demonstrated to reduce hit and run accidents by as much as 10% in the states where it's implemented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6195.836s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is why I'm putting this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6198.439s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I believe that the passage of this ballot question would materially benefit people of Medford by making our roads safer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6204.804s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's why I've been personally urging Medford voters to consider voting yes on four, and that's why I'm asking for my fellow councilors' consideration in endorsing this ballot question to make our roads safer for all vehicular drivers and pedestrians in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6218.453s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6390.798s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Be it so resolved that the Medford City Council express support of question four, dot, dot, dot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6944.584s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6945.705s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I want to thank Councilor Knight for putting this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6949.367s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, I think we need to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6951.725s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't know if this counts as outside of the box, but we need to think outside the box about how to resolve heretofore intractable problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6958.831s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's been frustrating for all of us to keep putting out requests for updates and requests that are simply germane to our responsibilities as councillors and not hear back and be kept in the dark.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6967.718s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that affects our ability to be accountable to the people who put us in office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6971.02s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that that's something we all share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6973.102s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm also not against drawing a line in the sand to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6977.827s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, continue to demonstrate to the administration that we are serious about being armed with the information that we need to forecast for this community's future and make responsible decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6991.097s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, I think sort of where my personal limits bump against that, I've demonstrated in some of my votes in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6999.564s">[Kit Collins]</a>: However, I think I'm willing to support this this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7006.935s">[Kit Collins]</a>: was the one other thing I was going to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7009.097s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Second time tonight I've done that long day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7012.441s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, in terms of what we're asking for from the finance department, I just think that it needs to be emphasized, you know, that it's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7026.183s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's not necessarily our best move to try to decrease what we're asking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7030.87s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're asking for reasonable things from the administration because of lapses in staff capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7036.579s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's our responsibility to ask for the policies that we know are in service of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7041.305s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And sometimes, I mean, we see it all throughout the community every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7044.887s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Those are not going to be enforced or implemented on the timetable that we'd like to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7048.189s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That is a feature of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7050.931s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But that doesn't mean that we should not ask for and legislate for and advocate for the policies that our community deserves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7059.856s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7526.686s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanted to make sure that residents heard about this prior to November 1.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7531.229s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a statewide ban going into effect because the majority of mattress or box spring materials are recyclable, which is why they are now required to be recycled and divert them from landfills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7542.618s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also saw this update from the city just a couple days ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7547.642s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A company called Hand Up is now offering mattress and box spring pickup in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7553.567s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So residents can schedule a pickup by going to handupmattress.com.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7559.773s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There is a charge for the service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7563.076s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7626.893s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7627.794s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I peruse this website a couple times a month just for general updates, and I was surprised to see a lot of open positions in the city of Medford not listed on the job board when I checked there last.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7638.521s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I did actually hear from Director Osborne just earlier today and said that they do frequently use this service to advertise the jobs that we are trying to fill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7647.188s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's just that they're taken down after 30 days, so I'm glad it's being used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7651.11s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I hope that it's continued to be used consistently as, you know, obviously this is a place where people qualified for municipal work are looking around and we have a great and urgent need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7661.896s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=70.58s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This was the meeting about the draft housing stability notification ordinance on which we'll be meeting again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=77.023s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1481.065s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1482.867s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm excited for the chance for this council to recognize and for the community to celebrate Walk, Bike and Roll to School Day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1491.174s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This celebration is a project of a coalition across Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1495.417s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Tomorrow, I have the opportunity to take part in a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1498.64s">[Kit Collins]</a>: bike to school caravan, which I'm very excited for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1502.364s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think that these celebrations are, you know, really take on more meaning when they're tied to action and a commitment to policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1510.351s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think it's great that we're recognizing the folks that do already take advantage of multimodal ways of getting to school and doing so safely and encouraging that as part of an active lifestyle for our school-age<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1523.003s">[Kit Collins]</a>: community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1523.984s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And at the same time, I think that it reflects the responsibility that city administration has on this body has to making sure that we're putting forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1533.735s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Policies in the programs as with as much urgency and speed as we can to make sure that our infrastructure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1541.342s">[Kit Collins]</a>: our ability to, our shared ability to get to school, to work, to wherever safely through all modes of transportation, increased cycling infrastructure, protected bike lanes being just one piece of that project and making sure that we're allocating the city resources to actually live and protect that vision, not just celebrate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1564.154s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1564.815s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1565.855s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Vice-President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4075.816s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Merlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4077.057s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4077.517s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Campbell, for being here tonight and to the other residents that are speaking about their experiences with parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4085.682s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The last time we spoke about this,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4089.399s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I know, I'm like, what instance was it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4092.201s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I made the comment, I think something along the lines of, you know, wondering because of the volume of complaints that we've been getting about residents' experience with parking and also complaints from within the parking department itself, from the rank and file and from the leadership wondering, was this department set up to succeed or was it set up to fail?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4110.513s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And listening to, you know, the resident experience,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4119.306s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, the new parking rules as they're filtering through the residence experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4123.91s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It strikes me that, you know, something that my dad used to tell me about writing is, you know, you can't brainstorm and edit at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4131.878s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You can't write and edit at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4134.04s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know from conversations with director Morrison that there's, sorry, this whole circus going on over here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4138.945s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm a little distracted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4139.886s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't know what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4147.687s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4149.248s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, you can't write and edit at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4150.889s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know that it's a huge mantle to spin up a whole new city department from nothing, you know, from a contractor that I think, you know, a lot of sources have said was mismanaging our parking system in the city beforehand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4162.015s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But it brings me back to that same question about was this department set up to succeed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4166.717s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Was it set up to fail?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4168.518s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is it even conceivable that a project of this scale<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4171.62s">[Kit Collins]</a>: could be started and refined and take back resident feedback and be guided and be modifying what it's doing all at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4180.024s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it seems like that isn't really happening based on what we're hearing from residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4186.468s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know that, you know, it's our parking department staff that's executing the work on a daily basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4194.612s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But, you know, we get very strong city communications about certain topics from our city administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4200.915s">[Kit Collins]</a>: about certain types of events and certain types of updates and certain types of developments in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4206.596s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And, you know, I'm really upset about the adverse effects of the new parking program on residents when they've been burdened by this and when they felt unheard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4217.179s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I'm also upset that the city administration isn't stepping up and taking more of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4222.08s">[Kit Collins]</a>: of the Brunton more the responsibility for directing this, um, in the way that I think it's their responsibility to do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4229.182s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so you know, we seem to have a great capacity for communicating about certain types of developments and certain types of updates in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4235.643s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think I think we're past due for seeing more of that capacity spread to the parking department, not just that it's more fair to the rank and file parking staff, the ones that are charged with just executing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4246.266s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the protocols, but also for the benefit of the residents who months later are still struggling to stay up to date with what's already been said about what we can expect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4253.728s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Why is this happening?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4254.628s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When is it going to change?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4255.548s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is it going to change?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4257.329s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6835.874s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6837.735s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was going to make many of the same points when we talked about this project several months ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6843.358s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I like to say we're a community that's very rich in plans, and this is so exciting because this is the chance to actually take<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6851.39s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the vision and those plans, which a lot of our, you know, truly expert dedicated city staff have worked on, you know, preparing the menu of options with which we can guide our future and create the policies that will bind us towards actually manifesting that future in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6865.723s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I appreciate you for bringing it forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6868.045s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Looking forward to this meeting and a motion for approval after the comments of my fellow<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8249.11s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8249.69s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I appreciate the petitioner being before us tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8252.131s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate the motion to table as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8253.971s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this is a matter I'd want to give some additional consideration to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8257.932s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that the point is well noted that this, um, company or its subsidiary already exists in Medford and there haven't been<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8264.555s">[Kit Collins]</a>: grave consequences noted that they've been a pretty good neighbor in the business community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8270.304s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think for myself, you know, it's hard for me as a representative to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8279.891s">[Kit Collins]</a>: further enmesh, you know, the subcontractor based economy in our community, knowing that there's no way of regulating, you know, if these are competitive with living wages, if these are, you know, as good of jobs as our local residents really deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8293.862s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that's not at all a reflection on the petitioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8295.823s">[Kit Collins]</a>: here before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8296.443s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I really appreciate the work you've put into this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8298.944s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's something I want to give more thought to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8301.726s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's the issue of, you know, the day-to-day, the traffic impact, the impact on this specific neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8307.768s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And in addition, you know, what type of businesses do we want to be making up our business ecosystem here in our community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8314.711s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8982.775s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8983.815s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was waffling back and forth on how to vote on this motion now that it's before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8995.617s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I had been thinking, just to speak candidly, I mentioned earlier, I think that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9003.015s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're all acutely aware of the many problems with the parking department and the ways that that's manifested into the lives of our residents and business owners into the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9015.207s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I also think that some of the ways in which that flack has been levied upon the parking department to the exclusion of higher ups in the city administration is not quite fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9024.377s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I have been thinking,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9027.113s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, why spread the grief around?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9029.354s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know from talking to staff in the parking department that as flawed and fraught as this parking meter repair project has been, you know, it was a lot of work to repair kiosks that had been broken and in disrepair because of Reef Republic for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9047.04s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Why not let them, you know, why not say yes to something immaterial?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9052.622s">[Kit Collins]</a>: However, the more I think about it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9057.96s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, everybody in the city works really hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9060.601s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that everybody who works in City Hall deserves an ice cream social for their efforts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9065.224s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think that but please let me finish.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9068.326s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Please let me finish.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9069.526s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that if we're talking about giving staff what they're due for their hard work, what I'd really like to see for the parking department is a bargained contract, you know, the recognition of their union.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9080.427s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that what these staff members deserve, because regardless of the outcome, we know that they're working hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9085.131s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What they deserve is not an ice cream social.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9088.253s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What they deserve is fair bargaining with this administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9092.076s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, this is the chain of thought that's changed my mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9094.418s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't want to keep more grief upon an embattled department, as flawed as it may be, but this isn't what they deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9100.983s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, parking is not what we deserve, but this isn't the reward that they deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9104.886s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What they deserve is fair working conditions, not a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9111.268s">[Kit Collins]</a>: a little pool party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9113.112s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10267.105s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10267.445s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate you putting this forward tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10269.848s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm glad to support it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10270.989s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think related to this, I want to note that I think on some of our previous meetings, if I seem oddly sympathetic to the parking department, when there's a lot of justifiable...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10280.99s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think there's been a lot of, um, angst going around because of you know how how that work is going so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10285.991s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think a lot of that is lodged in what I heard about the condition that the parking department was left in by reef technology at the outset of director Morrison's tenure in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10297.834s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um from various people within that department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10300.795s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have really very grave<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10311.4s">[Kit Collins]</a>: revenue that was who knows how amount and who knows how much of that actually ended up in the city of Medford protocols that seemed<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10320.415s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, just just deeply, deeply far from best practice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10323.217s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that, you know, does trace back to our city's mount on a blind, both in terms of what we were being compensated when brief was doing this work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10330.162s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If it was fair, if we even have a yardstick for how close to fair it was, um, and how that contributed to the high mountain that we now have to climb to get to a good place with parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10339.168s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, so I'm very interested in seeing this investigated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10341.47s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10570.03s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm going to withdraw this motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10571.25s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we better take it up closer to election day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=557.77s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=559.091s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This speaks for itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=560.012s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Rosh Hashanah began on Sunday night this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=562.474s">[Kit Collins]</a>: To all my fellow Jews, I just want to say Shanah Tovah to everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=565.696s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Hope the year ahead is a sweet one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=568.398s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=639.61s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell, and thank you very much for reading those URLs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=642.972s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My apologies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=643.733s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's my hope that maybe some of the folks tuning into the meeting or reading the agendas might recognize themselves in the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=650.357s">[Kit Collins]</a>: eligible groups and follow those links to state support of their work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=655.618s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for reading them out loud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=657.858s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanted to flag these two opportunities for fellow members of the Medford Arts community, individuals and organizations alike.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=666.12s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The local cultural council program is annual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=669.18s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It happens every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=669.901s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's a wonderful local program wherein our Medford Arts Council members of our own community get to dole out state resources to support<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=677.982s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the arts in Medford, for Medford, by Medford artists, and the cultural sector recovery grants is new this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=684.924s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It was part of the state's COVID response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=688.485s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's a way for both individuals and arts organizations to get a little much needed stimulus in that sector to support the work of the creative industry as we come out of the pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=701.748s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=781.127s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=782.008s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanted to help signal boost this latest offering from the Board of Health now that the bivalent boosters are available, you know, as we're heading into the fall months, you know, I think it's especially important for everybody to consider getting the new booster now that it's available so we can keep, you know, all of our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=801.961s">[Kit Collins]</a>: community members as safe as possible should they choose to make that choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=805.644s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I also want to thank the Board of Health as they continue to roll out these booster clinics as they've been doing all throughout the past two and a half years, you know, really big expansion of what their work is in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=816.593s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's so important and it's so appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=818.194s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=848.172s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=849.433s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I had the opportunity to talk with our Director of Traffic and Transportation, Todd Blake, at some point during the past month on a totally unrelated project, and he was telling me about how the MBTA shutdown has just magnified the workload that him and his colleagues have to already take on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=871.324s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, adding a huge layer onto their already very large workload.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=875.387s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Now that the orange line is running again, I hope that they're able to turn more of their attentions onto their already full plates and extend, you know, ask my Councilors to join me in extending our gratitude for their hard work during this really turbulent, deeply unprecedented time in our interactions with the MBTA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=892.457s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2668.056s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2669.117s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't want to belabor this point because we're going to have the whole meeting devoted to parking tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2673.281s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I just wanted to say in advance of that, you know, I know we've been fielding so many resident complaints about parking, and we've been hearing indeed from the parking department itself about the challenges that they're perceiving and working through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2686.872s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2688.464s">[Kit Collins]</a>: logical thing that anybody does is when there's a problem, you look, where did this come from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2693.365s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Who's responsible?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2694.025s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Whose fault is this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2695.746s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know we're gonna be hearing it directly from the horse's mouth tomorrow, but I just wanna, I feel like we need to lay the foundation for that conversation with, was our parking department, you know, whether it was right or wrong to bring them in house this year when we did, were they set up to succeed or were they set up to fail?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2713.71s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, because that decision was made<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2716.285s">[Kit Collins]</a>: before anybody got hired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2718.166s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That decision is unattached to anybody currently in that department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2722.107s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm not saying that the department has done everything perfectly because we all know that's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2726.909s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've gotten the phone calls about it, but I think it needs to undergird the conversation that we have with the people in that office directly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2734.852s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The context has to be, what did they know before their work began?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2739.834s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What did they know about the scope of their work?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2741.515s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What did they know about the Park Medford that was there before?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2746.795s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Were they given the true and authentic lay of the land?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2750.398s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Were they given the resources that they really needed to succeed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2754.762s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's part of the equation too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2756.043s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just want to put that out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4201.873s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4204.715s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Burrell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4208.46s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just in light of I think it's really helpful to get all these comments out in the open in light of the fact that we have a meeting on this tomorrow with city staff present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4217.342s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just I just wanted to remind folks about that opportunity, and also to, you know, kind of bringing it back to the conversation on, you know where actual authority and.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4229.098s">[Kit Collins]</a>: decision making power lies and where it doesn't lie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4231.481s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, I think it's really, really important that the council be sort of a filter through which we could hear what do people need from parking?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4238.531s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What don't people need from parking?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4240.554s">[Kit Collins]</a>: At the end of the day, the question of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4244.029s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, do we have the capacity to think through parking policies, to contemplate parking policies like a commission did two years ago?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4252.658s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Do we have the capacity to implement those?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4255.662s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Those aren't decisions that this body makes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4257.844s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think we have to keep advocating for citywide capacity to not just think through those questions, but then to follow through on the findings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4267.308s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, I see that being a really important role of this council, our ability to take in these comments and use that to fuel our advocacy for, you know, a level of city capacity that can both ask the question and then act on the answers that it's given.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4282.156s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And, you know, I just sort of wanted to end on that note, you know, in terms of my contribution to this conversation, knowing that we'll have a better format for this conversation tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4294.337s">[Kit Collins]</a>: with some of our parking department representatives here as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4297.838s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4298.998s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mr. Paris.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4658.719s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Rural.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4659.419s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanted to say, I think this is a prudent and proactive measure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4662.341s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I thank Councilor Tseng for putting it forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4857.659s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5011.898s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell, and thank you, Roberta, for being here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5014.219s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It was helpful to have the recommended changes and the current ordinance language in front of us ahead of the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5020.023s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Looking over it, it all looks very common sense to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5022.165s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If it makes more sense to discuss it in detail on Committee of the Whole, I'm certainly happy to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5027.324s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, but you know, I appreciate the thoroughness, you know, getting a chance to see it at a time, and it looks like something I'd be happy to support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5034.946s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So looking forward to discussing it further.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1125.559s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1126.26s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much for being here today and to all of you who are here today and for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1131.057s">[Kit Collins]</a>: speaking to the public and for speaking to us about what you've been going through and what you're trying to work on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1135.68s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I really appreciate this update as painful as it is to hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1143.904s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Like my fellow councilors, I will heartily stand with you and for your right to collectively bargain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1150.708s">[Kit Collins]</a>: To the idea that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1155.533s">[Kit Collins]</a>: we can't find the money to pay some of our essential workers a living wage, that that would somehow cause a dire financial situation for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1166.477s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's hard to hear because I think we all know that the work that you do is what keeps the essential functions of the city occurring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1176.121s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And to blame financial hardship on a reasonable cost of living adjustment, much less the raise that you so richly deserve is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1186.91s">[Kit Collins]</a>: a pretty bad faith argument to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1189.432s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, there's a lot of situations where it feels somewhat unfortunate that all the city council can do is advocate and insist and stand with people who are campaigning for things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1199.719s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And this is one of those scenarios, as Councilor Knight mentioned, there are places that our jurisdiction doesn't go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1205.022s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Things that we can't make the administration do, but for myself as another councilor, please know that we stand with you and please keep us updated and know that we're standing in solidarity with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5395.403s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to suspend the rules and take 22500 and 22502.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5410.667s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sure, I just know that my director, Director Hunt can't stay too long, so I wanted to make sure that we got to her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5443.577s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All right, so on the motion of Councilor Collins to take 22-500, 22-502, and 22-503, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5488.83s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5490.591s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've been enjoying serving on the Solid Waste Task Force so far this season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5495.114s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have some exciting opportunities for resident and business feedback on the work that we're doing, and Director Hunt is here tonight to share more information that my fellow Councilors and residents should know about the work ahead on re-evaluating the solid waste hauling contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5512.467s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=7541.485s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=7543.346s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just I think it deserves to be repeated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=7545.448s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think that Medford can currently say that it's delivering the city services and the civil services that the residents deserve and it's not delivering the workplace atmosphere compensation and benefits that its staffers deserve, and that makes these inscrutable dismissals, just all the more challenging to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=7566.497s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to see and to understand when we are already struggling to serve our residents the way that a 21st century city should, why we would dismiss city employees who are willing to forego greener pastures in the private sector for the mission of trying to do good work in a municipal setting in the city of Medford, it just boggles the mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=7589.85s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I thank Vice President Bears for putting this forward tonight because it needs to be said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=8616.696s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=8617.997s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I thank Vice President Bears for putting this forward tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=8620.519s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, the council is expected and empowered to provide financial oversight for the city, sign off on major contracts, transactions, appropriations, but there isn't any sort of binding or consistent structure for what kind of information we are to be basing these decisions on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=8639.913s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Putting these needs and expectations on the books as an ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=8643.837s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that could help enforce that the council actually gets the relevant information and on a timely schedule that we need to make these major decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=8653.685s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The only body in the city government that gets to sign off on these major decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=8657.528s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that could help enshrine more of the transparency and accountability that our constituents expect of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=8663.953s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I appreciate you bringing up the comprehensive plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=8666.435s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that applies to all of the, you know, I've said it before, we're very, very rich in plans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=8671.879s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We need,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=8673.511s">[Kit Collins]</a>: some sort of accountability structure so that we can navigate towards them and not just say, well, how do we end up here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=8681.393s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just navigate from that point year by year forever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=8684.233s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=8842.902s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=8844.763s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes, I think reviewing our pilot agreements, the status of our pilot negotiations should be a routine procedure, especially after the budget season that we just went through, knowing that the belt is already pulled so tight or our budget is so austere already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=8859.373s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's as crucial as it has ever been to make sure that our pilot agreements with our large institutional members are fair, holding these institutions accountable to paying their fair share, just like all other Medford residents do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=9128.697s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you President Morell for reading out the entire resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=9132.659s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The city council was contacted by the directors of the Kids Cancer Connection and the American Cancer Fund for Children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=9139.763s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so I was happy to put forth this resolution on the request and elevate the issue of cancer, affecting children I think this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=9148.747s">[Kit Collins]</a>: spells out the sad facts of the prevalence of this disease on this young population all across our nation and here in Medford as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=9159.735s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I asked for my fellow Councilors support in the statement and saying that our hearts go out to all the children and families affected by this difficult illness and that we applaud all the children and families going through this hardship and all the healthcare workers and caregivers who help heal these children and also help provide moments of joy and relief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=9179.163s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in this moment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=9612.895s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you President real and actually just earlier this afternoon I heard back from director O'Connor with an update about reviewing and updating the coven 19 information on the city website so it appears that as of today a lot of that information about the coven 19 resources that are available to Medford residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=9630.198s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the status of health orders, the new boosters, the ending of the USPS free test kit supply, the revocation of the mask mandates, that's all been updated to no longer display updated information, which is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=9644.803s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Very grateful to Director O'Connor and her staff for their quick work on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=9648.745s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And she also let me know that she is indeed already in contact with the State Department of Public Health on how to secure more of those test kits from the state's most recent offer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=9658.628s">[Kit Collins]</a>: of free ones to municipalities that could augment the tests that the Board of Health is already distributing at City Hall, the West Medford Community Center, Medford Housing Authority, the library, and the Council on Aging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=9672.499s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The second point that I wanted to make with this resolution which has nothing at all to do with the Board of Health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=9677.383s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just think that it has to be said again that the city website remains in very dire need of an overhaul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=9683.567s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and it's not just so that updates and new information may be added in a timely way, but also so that the city website can be simply readable and legible and navigable and looks like the professional website that one would expect to exist for a city of 60,000 people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=9700.777s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I don't mention that as, I feel uncomfortable mentioning that because it's not a dig at any<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=9705.7s">[Kit Collins]</a>: city staff worker or any department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=9708.561s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is just one of the many things that falls by the wayside when the city lacks the capacity to fully implement its projects, any project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=9715.725s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that's one of the many reasons that we need to keep up the drumbeat about municipal resources, because the lack of resources, the lack of bandwidth that translates into residents not having the services they deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=9727.05s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that includes a website that remains untranslated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=9730.412s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And frankly, even for me,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=9733.229s">[Kit Collins]</a>: is frankly hard to read and hard to navigate and hard to find information on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=9737.013s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=385.847s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2291.76s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, thank you so much for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2293.501s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Caraviello already got to one of my questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2295.922s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was gonna ask, you know, with a 0% loan, why stop at $7.8 million?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2300.024s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But if that's the cap, as I understand it to be from your response, then that makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2305.786s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then for my benefit, and perhaps for other less water meter savvy listeners at home, reading this, it sounds like phase refers to the phase of the project, tier refers to project specific<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2319.012s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Buckets of funding, is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2320.713s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is that the difference between phase two and tier two?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2348.666s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So the tier represents when that particular bucket of money expires?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2356.534s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2357.215s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2358.076s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Appreciate that clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2731.042s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2731.422s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, on the point of this being advanced notice ahead of the loan approval, I just wanted to say that from one councilor's perspective, you know, having the opportunity to ask questions before we vote on it is very helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2740.866s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I really appreciate the coming before us tonight, the foresight, it's very helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3025.818s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3026.218s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I just want to thank Councilor Caraviello for putting this on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3029.28s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that it's really normal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3031.321s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's really healthy for us to reevaluate the ordinances that guide what our hospitality industries can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3037.203s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And, you know, I've put things on the agenda in recent months to try and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3041.101s">[Kit Collins]</a>: see how we can work with the Liquor Commission, work with our economic development director to see what needs to change so that our bars and our restaurants specifically can thrive in our square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3051.186s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I hope that we can collaborate with the Liquor Commission and other relevant departments to see what needs to be changed and then go about changing it so that our business owners can cater to what people are looking for and do even better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3064.492s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3535.599s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell and Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3537.139s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that point is well taken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3538.68s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was going to second the motion to send it to Committee of the Whole for a hypothetical future meeting on revenue with the expectation that, you know, when this meeting might occur, we can amend the paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3551.603s">[Kit Collins]</a>: if we were to put the paper forward, speaking in very hypothetical terms here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3557.127s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In my mind, it's more of a placeholder move for now with the hope that we can have substantial future discussions on revenue with the mayor's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3565.394s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's all, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=6554.352s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=6555.192s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanted to thank Vice President Bears for putting this on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=6558.354s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know when I first took office earlier in the year and started getting those emails about the roads, I took a deep dive into the pavement management plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=6565.958s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it really is an encapsulation of a lot of the revenue spending issues that we're facing as a city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=6570.98s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, it goes without saying, when we don't have the money to spend on a problem, the problem gets more expensive to solve in this case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=6580.356s">[Kit Collins]</a>: by multiples.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=6581.717s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We all think the roads are bad enough now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=6583.979s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Certain roads I bike down, I feel like I'm gonna fall in and never hear from again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=6587.522s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that this really just drives home the point that we need to see a plan for how we're going to get on top of this, because it's hard for me to fathom the roads being what they are, and we all hear about it all the time, how that's gonna be in three years if we don't find a way to multiply our investment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=6602.334s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=6749.862s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell, and we have a couple of representatives of the Bradley Road Tenant Association here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=6754.746s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sure my fellow Councilors will remember hearing from some of these folks starting back in April.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=6762.471s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Really, I wanna let these tenants speak for themselves and give us an update on what they've been going through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=6768.135s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7220.484s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Marillyn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7221.525s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Liza, for being here and for speaking for your association.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7225.068s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My fellow Councilors will indulge me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7226.73s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just want to, again, thank you, Liza, and just draw out a couple things from what you said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7231.474s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As we had this discussion back in March, back in April, you know, I didn't want Liza to be here tonight on behalf of the Tenants Association because there's some action that we can take to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7241.862s">[Kit Collins]</a>: materially change their position right now, this week, this month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7246.585s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They're well aware of the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7248.006s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They've been working with professional housing justice organizers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7252.129s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They know the score and they know what they have to do next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7254.11s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But as I think we're all very acutely aware, this is a phenomenon befalling our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7261.255s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's been falling our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7262.676s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's happening right now on Bradley Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7264.257s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's happening on Fells Way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7265.258s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's happening at multiple properties in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7269.181s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We need to keep our focus on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7271.59s">[Kit Collins]</a>: we need to keep shining a light on everywhere this happens in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7278.713s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Specific to the story on Bradley Road, I just want to draw out a couple of points to make sure that they're heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7286.116s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Firstly, that the line was these vacancies are being created so that we can renovate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7292.258s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Renovations didn't happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7294.319s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Secondly, I think we talk often about the value of collective bargaining.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7299.378s">[Kit Collins]</a>: unionization and various circumstances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7302.119s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And when this group of tenants sought to do that, they were punished for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7305.68s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Materially, legally, they were punished for seeking to band together, to be in community with one another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7311.821s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it strikes me as a real double standard for who's allowed to exert pressure over a situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7318.583s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Given the state of the housing market regionally, not just in Medford, but regionally,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7323.564s">[Kit Collins]</a>: tenants and all sorts of residents are impacted by economic pressures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7327.686s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When they seek to do what they can to stay in their homes, to stay in a community that they've invested in, that they have students in the public school system, that they've lived their whole lives here, that type of pressure is allowed to be penalized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7339.692s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So again, I reiterate, I know there's no motion that we can pass tonight,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7345.272s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to make this expense, to make this anxiety, to make these months of work and trauma go away for these residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7353.554s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I felt it was very important to put Liza's story and the Bradley Road Tenant Association story on public record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=7360.556s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Again, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=8155.754s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=8156.375s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And thank my fellow councilors for putting this forward and allowing me to co-sponsor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=8160.798s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that President Morell put it perfectly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=8164.44s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=8167.524s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In my mind, there's no need to defend why these local policies are necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=8173.448s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But, you know, where there is a need for explanation, I'd say, and this goes for anything, your rights exist until they don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=8180.553s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think it's easy to feel in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, one of the, you know, overall bluest states in the nation, that this doesn't apply here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=8191.176s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's true until it isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=8193.117s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it's true in Massachusetts until it isn't, it's true in Medford until it isn't, that's true everywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=8199.28s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that the only responsible thing to do, I think I said this the last time we talked about reproductive justice and protecting medical care for women, for gender non-conforming people, for all types of people was on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=8212.745s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The way things are going, the failure to be progressive is regressive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=8219.048s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We need to be proactive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=8222.013s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All types of people's lives are at stake, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=8622.666s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=8623.466s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes, just echoing that, you know, this would be good to know where to start with this sense and figure out our next steps from there so that we can have a usable through way for pedestrians.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=8635.694s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=9144.951s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=9145.393s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=9146.317s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=9146.578s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Vice president bears first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=9147.762s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You're hurting this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=9149.766s">[Kit Collins]</a>: have been hearing a lot about these power outages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=9152.847s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For me, I mostly hear about it from folks in hillsides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=9154.947s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm shocked it hasn't affected my apartment building yet, which probably means in the next couple of days, since I'm saying that out loud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=9161.249s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But, you know, we were just talking earlier tonight about poor communication, you know, a feeling of lack of respect from some of the entities that affect life here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=9169.391s">[Kit Collins]</a>: To me, National Grid is top of that list, especially lately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=9172.972s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we deserve to know why these problems are happening more frequently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=9177.513s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And as Vice President Bears just said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=9180.314s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in the past time to be thinking long term, I wanna know, even if it's in the beginning stages of strategy for how we're going to protect our utilities, protect our increased load for electricity, protect against increased vulnerability because of increasingly intense storms that we know are coming, that are only gonna get more intense in future years, what is the plan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=9203.868s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that municipalities should be included in those discussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=9208.768s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and I'm eager to hear it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=9210.508s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11367.844s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell, and thank you for the discussion on this resolution so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11371.168s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that, you know, I'm glad that this motion will be discussed in the committee as a whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11375.552s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think there's a really robust discussion to be had here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11377.634s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that, you know, these revisions are made in good faith.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11381.519s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that a lot of folks on the historical commission are also acting in good faith.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11385.082s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think there's certainly a path forward to make sure that the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11390.41s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Values of this ordinance are enshrined and it really works well for the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=12096.081s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=12099.343s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=707.058s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Raul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=707.878s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for being here today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=709.998s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just could you clarify how long has your business been in business at this location?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=714.659s">[Kit Collins]</a>: How many years have you been at this address, or is this the first time you're applying?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=720.814s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Eight months you've been in business here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=723.116s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3671.493s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3671.673s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3674.594s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Not to belabor the points that Vice President Bears has already made, but just to underline a few of them to further<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3682.167s">[Kit Collins]</a>: expand on my perspective and why I was interested in co sponsoring this motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3687.268s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What I hear about the most from my constituents are roads, the library, the schools, trees, city services, as was discussed as we said ad nauseum during the fiscal year 23 budget process over the past month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3701.112s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have a structural deficit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3703.272s">[Kit Collins]</a>: we can't do more with less.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3704.493s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We can't continue to keep asking our city staff or city services to do more with less.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3709.676s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't find it acceptable to continue cutting city services to the bone and asking our residents to make do with fewer and fewer resources and services, asking our city staff to do more and more with less and less support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3725.305s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We heard during the fiscal year 23 budget process that next year's budget will likely be even leaner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3732.878s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think personally, I'm not willing to accept cuts that are even deeper for next year than what we were asked to contemplate for fiscal year 23 because we saw, and we heard from the residents and the staff of the city, how that would affect our city's operation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3749.542s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also want to emphasize as was already explained if the mayor approves this resolution if this resolution proceeds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3756.533s">[Kit Collins]</a>: as it's currently designed, it would become a referendum on the fall ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3760.38s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It would be left up to the voters to decide yes or no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3764.728s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is not a matter to be taken lightly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3767.718s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a big question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3768.599s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to see it put to the voters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3770.78s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This isn't something for the seven member bodies to decide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3775.183s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to see this put to the voters to decide how we invest in the future of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3781.987s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I also just wanted to shore up Vice President Bears' last point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3785.85s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that developing a reliable, sustainable, appropriate revenue plan to fund our communities<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3792.594s">[Kit Collins]</a>: urgent deserved needs is an urgent matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3797.238s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm also willing to collaborate and be flexible on what exactly that looks like, and including some other proposals that are on our council agenda tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3808.246s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm also open to exploring all of the options to mitigate the potentially painful effects of an override, for example, the proposal to increase the senior exemption to the maximum allowable<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3822.407s">[Kit Collins]</a>: for now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=3823.903s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6311.167s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6313.207s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll keep this short.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6313.927s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanted to add a little bit more elaboration around my perspective on the issue and to follow up on some of the points that my colleagues have made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6323.289s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I wanna thank all my fellow Councilors for the thoughtful dialogue around this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6329.85s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I really respect your points of view.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6331.11s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I hear where you're coming from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6332.15s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know that I think where we're all coming from is aspiring towards fiscal responsibility and doing what's best for the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6341.072s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I appreciate all of you for speaking from that perspective, though our opinions differ.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6347.517s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we all want to make sure that we're taking the best course of action for where we are right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6354.623s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And for me, just to explain my own perspective a little bit more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6359.637s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When I think about timing and process, I think back on the past six weeks and I think, well, the clock just started, it's 12 months until another level funded, level service budget that is going to be harmful for the schools, for the library, for constituents who don't know when their road is gonna get paved, not to mention all of the needs, housing stability needs, environmental needs, that we have no timeframe for when those are going to start to be filled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6389.435s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6390.998s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I agree that so many other measures are a crucial part of that formula, growing the commercial tax base being among them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6398.872s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I also know that those chickens aren't gonna come home to roost within the next 12 months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6404.417s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so this is why this issue to me is so glaring and so urgent that I want this override to be seriously considered because the needs going unmet in our community, to me, they're just that urgent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6417.422s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So the people that I'm hearing from, they're just that urgent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6420.784s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I just wanted to circle back to that point to share more on my perspective on why to me, that's the part of timing and process that I'm most preoccupied with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6431.188s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8882.01s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just want to make a point of information and not to clarify only your point, Mr. Penta.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8888.495s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm a renter, so when people talk about Councilors foisting things off on renters, I'm not going to speak for all of them, but I just want to state again, as I have many times this term, that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8898.751s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I am one, and I pay taxes through my rent, as does every renter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8903.853s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Please continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=12046.692s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All of my points have been made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=12047.772s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=12893.412s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=12893.852s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've been hearing from constituents complaining about the uncleanliness of the area around the pedestrian bridge and credit bridge by the Mystic River.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=12900.638s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also ride my bike along that path to get to every city council meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=12904.281s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm particularly attuned to the broken glass that's frequently on the path there, bit of a safety risk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=12909.725s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would love to hear an update from the administration about whose jurisdiction this public space is under and how we can support it being maintained for everybody's enjoyment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=12990.922s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=12991.422s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We'll skip over the part where we recount the funding issues we've been talking about tonight and for the past six weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=12998.146s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Given that our short-term municipal revenue growth is uncertain and we have so many needs already going unmet, and that the lack of accessible, affordable childcare is something that we've been hearing about from constituents all term long, I felt that the least I could do as a Councilor is to try and urge our state leaders to help the communities out with providing for this critical resource.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=13017.796s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The point I try to make every time I put a state bill on the agenda is that state issues are local issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=13022.919s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I wish that we could fund all of these services in-house with municipal revenue, but until we can, I will continue to advocate for state resources to leave Medford families less in the lurch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=13032.684s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3867.514s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President real, not a question for you, Director McGovern but thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3871.197s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanted to circle back quickly to the hundred $65,000 free cash appropriation for the three hybrid hybrid police cruisers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3880.664s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And first just thank you to all the department heads who have provided context around these appropriations more just a comment I know earlier in our budget process, you know we've.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3889.231s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in the scope of other useful amendments to the budget process just to add some accountability transparency legibility for this council and also residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3900.156s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know as Councilors probably said this wasn't something that I think was included in the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3904.358s">[Kit Collins]</a>: budget presentation for the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3907.119s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's good to know that this is typically a free cash appropriation when we buy new police cruisers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3912.46s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanted to reiterate an idea that was floated earlier in budget season that we do a more thorough job of separating out capital expenses, operating budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3922.542s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that it's useful for this council to be able to have a full accounting per department, even where those severances are the norm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3930.984s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think it's helpful for residents as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3934.425s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to be able to get a fuller picture pre cash appropriation operating budget capital expenditures to get a fuller picture of the breakdown per department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3943.932s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=4868.753s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President, I just, um, I just wanted to note for for context.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=4875.97s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't have an opinion either way on if this is a good use of ARPA funds it's an acceptable use of ARPA funds it's an eligible use of ARPA funds, but I just wanted to make the point that it's a $7.2 million bite out of a finite $48 million Apple, and this was brought up earlier in the budget season I just want to reiterate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=4897.213s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The narrative around use of ARPA funds is that there's four categories of eligible uses and there's going to be a robust public process for determining the use of some of those funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=4908.742s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think the fact that we are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=4911.61s">[Kit Collins]</a>: leaning heavily on one of the, you know, I'll be eligible uses revenue replacement for salaries, which is a perfectly fine compliant use of that money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=4919.992s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think that the residents deserve a more transparent and frequently updated view of where we're dispensing our funding, especially since<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=4932.15s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The story that's told about ARPA is that everybody gets to weigh in on how that money is used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=4937.192s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think people need to have a really clear insight as to when they'll get the chip in, how meaningful that input will be because of how much we'll have left.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=4948.936s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15265.415s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15387.548s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15388.688s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Now that we've come to this part of the budget meeting, I want to say I know I've been a little on the quiet side this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15395.751s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's because I think that most of the important points have been made by my fellow councilors and by department heads and by residents who have spoken here in person and on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15408.578s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I concur with so much that has been said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15412.139s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And, you know, I think that this is a moment where, as Vice President Paris just said, this is our last chance to advocate for our council priorities, which are the priorities that we hear from our constituents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15432.711s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So with that said, you know, it's my hope, you know, with the cut to KP law, with other cuts on the table, it's my hope that the mayor will return if, depending on how the budget vote goes tonight, that we can return to an amended budget proposal that maintains all existing funding for all of our critical municipal departments, pending meaningful negotiation with the city council about the council's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15460.842s">[Kit Collins]</a>: priorities as it was said there are several we've been clear about them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15464.366s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We we didn't see those listen to responded to in the budget that was noticed and given to us for consideration tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15476.411s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I do want to say, while I really appreciate the proposals that the mayor floated earlier this evening, I hope that she could empathize with the feeling that I cannot in good faith reconsider my feelings on a $200 million budget in light of proposals that are being raised at the 11th hour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15500.548s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So to that end, I feel that I need a guarantee that our council priorities will be revisited and taken seriously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15509.232s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so with no joy at all, I want to turn to line item executive full-time salary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15515.635s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's line item 0101025110, and suggest a cut of $202,887.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15529.64s">[Kit Collins]</a>: or 202-887.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15531.421s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that this funding is in the budget because it's critically important, but I want to get across in no uncertain terms that there are other critically important needs that are not in this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15539.943s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There must be room for both.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15541.703s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I wouldn't make the suggestion if I didn't know that there is room for both.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15548.405s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And frankly, I don't accept the paradigm that there aren't options to make room for our council priorities, which are the community's priorities,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15558.892s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and all of the departmental needs that are already in this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15562.854s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that's my motion to cut line item 0101025110 by $202,887.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15565.315s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And what line was that for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15567.736s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For the executive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15568.416s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's on page 75.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15632.145s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That is correct and it's my hope that this would galvanize a process of negotiation with the city council that would also include expediting returning those monies to an amended budget proposal that also includes more city council priorities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15670.584s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I believe the proposed amount for fiscal year 23 is $458,185.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15691.211s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That comes from a proportion of aggregated salaries within that department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15696.814s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And again, I just wanna emphasize, it's not my intention that this money should actually disappear in the fiscal year 23 budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15705.599s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As I said, I feel that I need<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15709.757s">[Kit Collins]</a>: some sort of guarantee that City Council's priorities will be meaningfully answered, answered in earnest, responded to in a potential amended budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15721.594s">[Kit Collins]</a>: proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15722.715s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I want to reiterate, it's not about individuals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15725.558s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's not about positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15728.44s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's my firm conviction that we have space to add these positions back and add back our City Council priorities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15734.846s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I wouldn't put forth this proposal, I know it's a controversial one, if I didn't think that this City Council would swiftly approve a supplemental appropriation pending negotiation on our other priorities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15992.961s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Moran.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15993.602s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Before I take the vote, I just wanted to say to Councilor Caraviello, I'm happy to review a friendly amendment if you had a different number in mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=16000.932s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's the spirit of the cut that I really feel strongly about keeping on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=16009.343s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Though I do want to just reiterate again that it would be my full earnest conviction to approve a supplemental appropriation as soon as it came to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=16018.23s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And this, I just, to be clear procedurally was not, would not delete any positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=16023.013s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It would just reduce the amount set aside in that line item until a supplemental appropriation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=16030.299s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just to make that clear and I'm happy to hear your feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17579.208s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17581.269s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanted to take the opportunity to make a statement on explaining my vote on this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17588.353s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And before I dive into it, I just wanted to make it really clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17593.976s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My no vote is not personal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17597.478s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is not a referendum on the skill or the integrity of anybody in this administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17604.362s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's because I see an unambiguous need for a bolder budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17609.638s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and I have to save my support for a bolder budget because I feel that's why I was elected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17617.167s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Since before I sought office, I've been feeling alarmed by our city's lack of capacity for vital basic services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17625.416s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If I knocked on your door during my campaign last year,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17628.58s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You probably heard me talk about my aspirations, for example, for the city to start an Office of Housing Stability and Office of Immigrant Outreach, for the city to be a leader in net zero development, invest in local public health resources, grow our tree canopy, fund a fully modernized website and on and on and on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17646.548s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And my conviction that it is necessary that we push for more and better and more equitably distributed services in our community is why I'm sitting in this chair today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17655.613s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm well aware<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17656.933s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that list I just mentioned comprises some pretty ambitious policy goals and I am very, very well aware of the constraints that our city, like all cities, operates under.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17667.926s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We always have to be realistic about what is achievable in any given term or any fiscal year, but this budget goes far<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17675.216s">[Kit Collins]</a>: below just being realistic and achievable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17679.199s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This budget does not, to me, address the bare bones, basic, uncontroversial fundamentals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17685.965s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're not looking up at the ceiling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17687.746s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are looking up at the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17690.781s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I believe that all of us are painfully aware of just how much we have to build up just to get back to baseline, to recover from the past two and a half years, to repair our roads and sidewalks and municipal infrastructure, to support those who are at risk of getting priced out of this community, to build a more resilient future, to take care of all of our residents the way that they deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17712.138s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it is all urgently necessary work it's urgently necessary work that feels to me unacceptably out of reach, because this budget doesn't even address the basics that our community needs and deserves this year right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17727.947s">[Kit Collins]</a>: just to restate some of what's been already put on the record tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17731.728s">[Kit Collins]</a>: While students, teachers, and education staff are yearning to recover from the trauma and the substantial learning loss of the pandemic, the schools are level funded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17740.132s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And in an environment of 8.5% inflation, level funding means less.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17745.353s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Less support for staff, less staff in the buildings, less support for students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17750.563s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We spent years building a beautiful, brilliant new public library, and everybody chipped in, all through their taxes, and many with extra generosity on top.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17760.767s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And under this budget, we can't fully staff it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17764.949s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Again, level funding means less service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17768.768s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thanks to community advocates translation services did occupy a place in the city's operating budget, which brought us closer to the goal of enabling all Metro residents to start to participate in city meetings, be equitable, equitably served by city communications, a goal which is still not really fully realized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17786.452s">[Kit Collins]</a>: but in this budget proposal, there wasn't even room for translation services anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17791.476s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's been shifted to one-time funding, ARPA, which, as has been stated, expires in December of 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17798.481s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Something so fundamental as making sure that what comes out of City Call will be receivable and intelligible by all constituents has no place being relegated to one-time funding services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17811.231s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Finally, this City Council<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17814.137s">[Kit Collins]</a>: is where residents come to advocate for any number of issues facing the community, from potholes to public safety to public health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17820.579s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The channel that we have to respond to those issues with is our power to legislate, to craft ordinances and zoning that reflect our city's wants and needs, to enforce our standards for a safe city and organize for a livable future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17836.744s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But with no dedicated legal staff for the council, after many, many requests,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17842.052s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and our critical phase two of zoning going, you know, without a commitment, we aren't being given the necessary tools to do this job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17851.66s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to know how to be an effective legislator when we have to join a week's long queue to get a legal opinion on an ordinance, which has been my lived experience in the first six months of my term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17862.45s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to know how to craft smart and thoughtful zoning reforms that will protect us in the climate change future when we don't have $50,000 for a zoning consultant, which for context is .025% of our current operating budget proposed for next fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17879.727s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These are not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17881.246s">[Kit Collins]</a>: To me, trivial or petty matters, matters of convenience for me and my fellow councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17887.75s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's more important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17888.51s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Those hampers are the only channel that this body has to address issues like housing stability, tree canopy, environmental standards, language accessibility, infrastructure safety, and on and on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17899.356s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When the city council is denied tools to be effective, the community loses its advocate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17904.79s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that even under ideal circumstances, we cannot do or even start all that needs to be done in a single year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17913.398s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But this administration had told us explicitly that this year, the city is expected to do more with less, and that the plan for next year is to make do with potentially even less than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17923.687s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I cannot condone that plan, and I cannot condone that trajectory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17927.049s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The stakes are too high, and the needs are too great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17930.656s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that because we've been hearing from you and not just about the library and the schools and how hard it is to give our municipal workers the pay and the support that they deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17940.405s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I hear from you about afterschool and infrastructure and basic constituent services and housing stability resources that you need and we cannot provide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17950.335s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I need a commitment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17952.368s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that the unassailable values that this administration promotes, like equity, security, sustainability, inclusion, that these are values in practice and not just awards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17963.231s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And this budget does not yet make that commitment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17966.292s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I desperately wanna see a budget proposal that makes a good faith effort at exemplifying those values that goes further.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17973.955s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I wanna see a proposal that says, we will move heaven and earth to fund our schools and our community spaces and acknowledges that we cannot afford to defer<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17982.448s">[Kit Collins]</a>: on climate change and represents a real plan for making this community better every year, supporting all Medford residents the way they deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17989.913s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I haven't seen that plan yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17992.415s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When I do, and I hope I see it soon, I will vote yes on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=17996.918s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then I will work with my fellow Councilors and this administration to make those values manifest in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18002.822s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Because throughout this term so far, I can confidently say that this council has sought a collaborative approach with this administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18012.088s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But this is a moment where we must insist on reciprocity and collaboration in the service of our critical goals for the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18020.85s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Because what I'm waiting for is what the community is calling out for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18025.411s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In sum, this budget, less than we deserve, less than we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18028.872s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I wish that we had the opportunity to negotiate about this, to dive into these questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18035.105s">[Kit Collins]</a>: weeks ago, months ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18036.926s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is not the process that I wanted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18039.288s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is not the tone that I wanted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18040.909s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't like any of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18043.03s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I know that we have options for doing better for next year, but also for fiscal year 23.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18048.714s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's why I can't accept this proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18050.555s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's why I'll be voting no on the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18052.417s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for letting me take the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18840.162s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's five minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18842.623s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's just five minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20579.615s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20580.496s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you so much, Madam Mayor, for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20587.037s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Process aside, everything that's happened in the past aside, I'm happy that we're here and having this discussion, even though I think we all wish it were happening at a different time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20595.558s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have a question for my fellow councilors, and I have a question for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20600.747s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The list that you've laid out sounds good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20603.809s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I can hear that it reflects the priorities that we've articulated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20608.192s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My question is what procedurally is the process that we can do right now having a budget on the agenda?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20616.697s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My understanding is we cannot make appropriations to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20623.042s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My understanding is amendments cannot be made to that because it's already on the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20627.845s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What is the process for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20630.417s">[Kit Collins]</a>: confirming these appropriations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20658.237s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for that clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20659.298s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20660.298s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then my question for my Councilors is, well, on the one hand, this checks a lot of my boxes, which I clearly said earlier, were red lines that I didn't feel I could cross.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20674.006s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's late in the night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20675.347s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A lot of people have dropped off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20676.588s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This isn't ideal timing, but we have this before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20679.87s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'd really appreciate to hear from more members of this body about how to go forward from here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20686.333s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you again, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=22293.103s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=23138.826s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=23139.566s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll keep this as short as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=23140.926s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In the remarks I made earlier, I mentioned<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=23143.887s">[Kit Collins]</a>: solicitor for the council zoning consultant schools libraries from the bottom of my heart, I want to thank the mayor and her team for coming back to the table for making sure that we cross back over those bright lines that I had and many of my fellow Councilors had this this has been a wild evening, it's been a wild but season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=23165.227s">[Kit Collins]</a>: when describing the mayor, you know, during last year's campaign through this term, I've said she's a good faith actor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=23170.49s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I really, I want to thank her for providing evidence of that tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=23175.192s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I hope that we can have this kind of direct line of communication and exchange more often.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=23180.715s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But for now, I just want to say thank you to the chief of staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=23182.896s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you to mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=23184.517s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let's pass this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=23311.853s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I found them in order and I move for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=23313.655s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=50.435s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion to suspend the rules to take petitions, presentations and similar papers, and then public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=1273.877s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Vice President Bears and thank you, Mr. rainy for being here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=1278.902s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would definitely concur with everything Councilor cardiologist said I hope that this could be the start of a really positive flywheeler feel feedback loop between bringing good jobs to our community, updating or using our updated zoning code to really<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=1294.161s">[Kit Collins]</a>: grease the wheels of that, and then following up with making sure that we have the developments needed to house all this positive new development and movement in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=1302.923s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So if this is, I believe if our next move is to report this out to the Community Development Board, I would make a motion to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=1309.124s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then I would look forward to hopefully approving it when it comes back our way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=1491.878s">[Kit Collins]</a>: While we're under suspension, motion to take paper 22400 followed by 22408.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2295.554s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you very much for being before us today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2297.535s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As a small business owner myself who's done pop ups I, you know, I respect you for what you're doing I appreciate the spirit of reconnaissance to see if a brick and mortar community is kind of the space that you'd want to grow roots and.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2312.38s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm interested by the potential issue just with the permit that's before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2316.781s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Obviously, if it's not appropriate, there's something to figure out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2319.742s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's something that I think procedurally we should run down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2323.663s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But in terms of next steps, as was stated, if we table this for one week, we're in July.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2330.624s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then if we're thinking about Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays, that windows it down to 12 or 13 days that are potentially when you'd be overlapping with hours of service at other brick and mortars locally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2344.348s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My inclination would be if we get the procedural kinks worked out, you know, I'd love to see you pop up, especially since you have a demonstrated interest in seeing this as a community that you could grow roots in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2353.534s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that'd be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2354.394s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, I like that you're a nonprofit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2355.675s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It sounds great on paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2359.137s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I guess I'm curious to hear from my fellow Councilors procedurally, what's the next step?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2363.94s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If it's really limited to less than, you know, two weeks of business days,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2371.858s">[Kit Collins]</a>: how we can go forward from here to give you your shot at sussing out if downtown Medford is a place that you can, that you can grow in and to make sure that we're, you know, giving our, giving credence to the, the shops that are already, already in Medford square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2893.266s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Vice President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2896.467s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The full electronic copy of the budget may be online right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2901.65s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When I left my house at 4.30, it was not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2903.931s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I haven't had a chance to review the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2906.112s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, goes without saying, I respect the state deadline for issuing this budget to us, but I haven't had a chance to look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2913.056s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so I don't feel comfortable voting on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2914.457s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'd motion to table for one week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3663.158s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'd like to withdraw the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4123.252s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President Bears on my also look forward to supporting each of these tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4127.456s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanted to make two points in in support, the first around the measures to get some measure of transparency greater measure of transparency into our budget process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4138.507s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So often and not even just kind of constellating around this year's budget process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4143.292s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know I hear from constituents saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4145.964s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Why is it the roads aren't getting better?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4147.986s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Why can't we improve our infrastructure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4150.348s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Why is it like this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4151.269s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Why is that like that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4152.23s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Why don't we have this resource that our neighboring communities, cities that seem similar to ours, do have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4158.795s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think a lot of the time, not all the time, a lot of the time, constituents, when they pose these questions to our administration and department heads, a lot of, much of the time, the answer boils down to, well, we're doing the best that we can, and that's true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4173.468s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Like, no grievance that we or constituents have about the operating of this city comes down to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4184.538s">[Kit Collins]</a>: a lack of skill or lack of dedication or lack of energy by any of our city staff that are tasked with taking these projects on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4192.725s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But when we say we're doing the best that we can, that's not descriptive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4195.888s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We need a better accounting of, well, why is the ceiling right here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4200.792s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And is it actually enough?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4203.395s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We need to get specific on everything that we're deferring, every project that we're deferring, all the priorities that we can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4211.052s">[Kit Collins]</a>: talk about and write about and plan about but failed to implement because we don't have the funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4216.736s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Like I said in our committee of the whole earlier about the school department budget, our values don't really matter for much if we can't act on them and we can't act on them if we can't fund them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4227.243s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think that I think that these are essential tools for both.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4231.407s">[Kit Collins]</a>: being more transparent and informative with our constituent base who ultimately see the decisions that filter through or don't filter through are at a real capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4240.735s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then secondly, to follow up on that, I think over the past couple of years, year and a half, the specter of ARPA has been cast over our community like it has so many.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4253.225s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4257.27s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that there's been real room for improvement and how this funding has been talked about how it's been speculated about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4263.502s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's not something that I would attribute to to any one person at all, to be honest, I think that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4270.062s">[Kit Collins]</a>: a real historic infusion of one-time funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4273.763s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So rapidly evolving during a rapidly evolving time, there's always gonna be ways to imagine that and then the rubber hits the road of how it can actually be implemented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4283.744s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think that the past couple weeks have made it clear that we need to start getting much more specific, much more concrete about how much of these funds we have left and how much will be left to implement<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4298.609s">[Kit Collins]</a>: community articulated priorities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4301.552s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that we have, you know, an excellent staff member who, you know themselves is ARPA funded, working on this very project of making sure that we're being responsible with our ARPA funding, but I also think that there's been a lot of competing narratives<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4315.024s">[Kit Collins]</a>: about how much money is available, how much will be directed with the input of the community, what goes through the council, what doesn't go through the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4325.368s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just think that there's a real lack of clarity that, again, is not the fault of any one person at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4333.151s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think we need to start cleaning that up right now, because this is such a live issue, not just in this funding cycle, but clearly for the next one as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4341.455s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I thank you for putting these forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4342.815s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think they're essential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4344.414s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I hope that we can partner with the administration on really seeing these through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2889.558s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2891.539s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I also want to join in thanking Vice President Bears for his presentation tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2895.34s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that maybe one of the definitions of leadership is being willing to say what is unpopular, what you know people don't want to hear because it's the right thing to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2905.984s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm glad that we have that coming from somebody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2908.224s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The budget proposals that we've received so far<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2913.982s">[Kit Collins]</a>: have demonstrated, I think this is clear to anybody paying attention so far have demonstrated their operating budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2919.466s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It not only cannot support the current level of service that for example our library patrons and staff infrastructure, public school students and teachers and staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2929.927s">[Kit Collins]</a>: crumbling infrastructure already has a need for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2932.99s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It also, as has been demonstrated, at least bear the reliance on one-time funding that's needed just to balance the operating budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2942.559s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it's been made abundantly clear that we have no concrete plans to look forward to to better our mid and long-term future to navigate out of the situation that we find ourselves in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2952.143s">[Kit Collins]</a>: no plan except to hope that things will get better on their own.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2957.147s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This administration has already divulged that the next year for fiscal year 24, it's likely that the belt will be pulled even tighter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2966.615s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It was wishful thinking to assume that we had the level of revenue replacement that the original proposed budget proposal was based off of, and the revenue replacement calculation for fiscal year 24 will only be smaller.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2979.625s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is not our plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2980.446s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This cannot be our plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2983.152s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I want to acknowledge it is true that the administration is uniquely and solely responsible for balancing money in, money out, coming up with a budget that keeps the entire city afloat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2994.756s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a huge cross to bear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2996.856s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That is a heavy burden.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2998.377s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is a huge responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2999.657s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I acknowledge that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=3000.698s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't envy the task of putting the budget proposals together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=3003.959s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think everybody here understands that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=3005.919s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But at the same time, that branch of our government<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=3009.0s">[Kit Collins]</a>: is the only one that is empowered to do those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=3011.863s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's the only branch with that power to make those decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=3015.808s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we knew going into it, we knew going into this term, that the situation was never going to be easy, that these circumstances are bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=3023.036s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You cannot go through a pandemic and emerge unscathed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=3026.812s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think each of us knew exactly what we were getting in for when we ran for office two years into a global pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=3033.295s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The circumstances are real, but allowing these circumstances to justify what we do or don't do to better our future, that doesn't help us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=3041.339s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That isn't what we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=3042.079s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That isn't what our constituency deserves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=3047.221s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When this administration is ready to take the reins to collaborate,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=3051.637s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I am ready to collaborate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=3052.677s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that this entire council is ready, enthusiastic to collaborate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=3056.858s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I feel that starting with the very first meeting of this year, this council has gone to bat for the administration's priorities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=3064.1s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've supported personnel appropriations and sought to codify ordinances that would all further this administration's goals and priorities in addition to the goals and priorities of the people that we were elected to represent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=3076.882s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I believe that we've made every attempt to have a proactive and organized budget process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=3083.431s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's a lot to say, but there's a couple, to me, key points that I just want to underline from what's already been said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=3089.754s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's not to me just that our very thin, highly curated list of council budget priorities didn't fit into this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=3099.358s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Priorities like an assistant city solicitor, a code enforcement officer, a zoning consultant,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=3104.82s">[Kit Collins]</a>: nothing sexy, nothing expensive, all of which are directly tied to the ability of this legislative body to do what it's elected to do, which is to legislate and in legislating to support the goals of the administration and the goals of the people that we were elected to represent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=3121.427s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it's not just that this budget spells out a reduction in services for, again, just for example, library patrons and staff and public school students and teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=3132.272s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's not even the opacity<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=3134.966s">[Kit Collins]</a>: of this budget process, that it's been so disorganized, that it's been so late breaking, that it's been hard to read any transparency into the process, even though I know, I'm sure that was an intention, it's been hard to see that there at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=3148.812s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The point to underline in all of those frustrations is this, that this plan, as the administration has stated, is to pass this austerity budget and follow it up for one for fiscal year 24 that will be even worse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=3160.818s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When I talk to constituents, this is what I hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=3164.808s">[Kit Collins]</a>: roads and sidewalks, a better Medford public high school, better outreach to our marginalized constituencies, an office of housing stability, affordable and accessible afterschool, and on and on and on and on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=3182.182s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have many needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=3182.963s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's what a government is for, to support its constituencies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=3187.393s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Many of these are matters of the most basic constituent services, again, potholes, but they are also a matter of equity and of justice, of properly serving the constituencies that we represent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=3202.381s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And if we are to implement our city's many laudable plans, the social justice roadmap, the climate action and adaptation plan, the pavement management program, et cetera,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=3216.128s">[Kit Collins]</a>: we need to fund those values.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=3220.009s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So these cuts to the school and the library budget are just a glimmer of what's to come if we don't change course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=3227.231s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll end with a quote from something my dear old dad loves to say, people don't fail to plan, people don't plan to fail, they fail to plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=3240.535s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And to follow up on that, I also wanna note one of actually my favorite quotes which comes from our mayor, which is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=3248.343s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A vision without a plan is just a hallucination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=3251.166s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that this council is ready to partner in planning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=3256.33s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=3937.754s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Not knowing if it's already on the table, I just wanted to make a motion to approve the recommendations included in Vice President Bears' presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=4811.637s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you vice president bears and thank you councillor knife for putting this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=4815.539s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As you just said, I'm not sure of my stance on this so far I'm not sure I agree with giving city employees retirees preference over equally eligible people but until far as this is just a request for information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=4825.002s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm all certainly supported tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=663.607s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Rowe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=665.007s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for the presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=665.968s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=667.188s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You said that the whole building inside and out will be renovated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=670.989s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Will the remainder of the interior space be used as offices for Needham Bank?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=674.99s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Will all of the interior space be used for the drive-through?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=678.571s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm just curious how the rest of the building will be used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1291.34s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Marillyn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1292.401s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1293.841s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just one question I saw under the conditions that our chief engineer attached to this petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1301.846s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just the first one said the recommendation that the grant of location be revised to reflect the accurate location as shown in the plan, just to make sure that the paperwork reflects where the work will actually be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1313.572s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanted to ask if that revision had been made or if not,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1318.92s">[Kit Collins]</a>: if it could be what the process would be for making sure that the location is reflected accurately on the grant of location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1325.063s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4249.237s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Vice President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4250.417s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Knight, for putting this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4251.818s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was happy to see this on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4254.059s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this is, you know, obviously just the type of structure that we all want to be seeing and, you know, our conversation starting at 5.30 just shored up how critical it is for us to be getting much more regular<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4264.862s">[Kit Collins]</a>: communications, you know, and as the term goes on, my belief strengthens that, you know, the way to make sure we see something is to put it in an ordinance, even if the path to getting it there is more difficult than it should be given the resources at our disposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4279.915s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And, you know, I think this goes for other<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4282.477s">[Kit Collins]</a>: this is not just for this administration or this term, it's a way to declare this is just how it should be going forward, not contingent on any administration or any council CFO relationship, it's just how it should be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4296.485s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I was glad to see this on the agenda and I appreciate you putting it forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4358.526s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4359.447s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this is my attempt to resurface a paper that was put forth by former Councilor Falco in February of 2021.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4367.993s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It was referred to the subcommittee on the elderly and housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4373.738s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I just wanted to add this to the lengthening queue of projects that will undergo in subcommittee and the housing subcommittee in particular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4381.884s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've felt it's important for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4383.865s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For a long time, I've been excited for us to draft a proposed ordinance around the idea of housing stability communications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4391.15s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And the events in this community of the past three months have unfortunately only solidified my sense of the urgency for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4400.616s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In the past two weeks, I've heard of two separate buildings, not including the one that we all heard from in person in March that are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4409.862s">[Kit Collins]</a>: encountering landlord-tenant strife, where there are potential issues of tenant exploitation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4416.808s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And regardless of the circumstances and the outcomes of those particular cases, what that says to me is we need to have, we need to set up a system in our community<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4428.778s">[Kit Collins]</a>: like those that exist in other communities where when a landlord-tenant relationship is established, the rights and the resources and the rules that govern that relationship are made clearly known to both parties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4441.102s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This type of ordinance can be tailored however we see fit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4445.564s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know some communities set it up so that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4449.325s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When a lease comes to an end, a tenant receives a city-approved memo on things you should know when you're terminating your lease in other communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4458.173s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's that, as well as within 30 days of moving in, your landlord has to provide a city-approved memo on your rights and resources as a tenant in your language spoken at home within a month of moving in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4471.124s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's just a great way to make sure that everybody is on the same page<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4474.827s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and knows everything that they should know to be empowered in that relationship.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4478.853s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think that this is something, I don't think that this should be a big lift for our city, and I'm excited to discuss it further when the housing subcommittee is able to get around to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=5057.956s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=5058.737s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I thank my Councilor Tseng for working with me on this idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=5064.221s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think when it comes to, um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=5067.921s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the general topic of, you know, we're in a national moment where in some parts of the nation, the civil liberties of the LGBTQ plus community, including those seeking gender affirming care, those civil liberties are being questioned, they're being threatened, they're being attacked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=5086.777s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think this is the moment in which, you know, the failure to be proactive is actually regressive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=5095.017s">[Kit Collins]</a>: know, the anti-LGBTQ plus operatives in our more conservative parts of the nation, they want our neighbors seeking gender affirming care to feel isolated and atomized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=5107.534s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That is their political angle, that is their power play, so we have an opportunity to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=5114.026s">[Kit Collins]</a>: distort that narrative by promising safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=5117.328s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That is how we can be an ally to our neighbors and other parts of the nation and stand against these threats to civil liberties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=5124.573s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I also want to note, you know, there's precedent for this sort of ordinance, this sort of resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=5129.376s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The Medford Police Department entered into a commitment of non-compliance between the police department and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=5137.001s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So there's, I feel like there within our community and others, there's broad precedent for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=5142.304s">[Kit Collins]</a>: standing up for protection of rights where we have jurisdiction to do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=5148.649s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I respectfully ask for the support of our colleagues and discussing this ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=5464.542s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sorry, if I may, I just want to, I want to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=5470.849s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to go back to the text of the resolution, this would forbid the city of Medford and municipal entities not to recommend or provide any medical care at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=5478.632s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Obviously that is not what we do at this municipality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=5481.174s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What this does is forbid us from assisting out of state requests for civil or criminal action against those who are seeking that type of care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=5489.958s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that is simply saying we will not participate in bounty hunter programs to keep additional legal trouble upon people who are trying to make<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=5500.146s">[Kit Collins]</a>: medical decisions for themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=5501.987s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanted to clarify that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=5951.641s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Murillo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=5952.422s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was going to make the same point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=665.466s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President, we're all thank you Councilor Carvial for putting this on the agenda I just wanted to note I saw maybe it was last week or two weeks ago, some looked like planting flower planting work being done in some of the bump outs or center islands.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=677.51s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Off of made a mystic and South Medford and just to your point it really is an issue of a little goes a long way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=682.451s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think it'd be great to get an update on is that going to be done throughout the city where can we expect for it to be done next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=688.593s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, towards your point, you know, really helps a lot to improve the appearance of our main streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2388.859s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2389.7s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And yeah, I appreciate this topic being brought up and much of what my fellow Councilors have already said on the topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2393.962s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I just think it, not to be repetitive, but I think it really bears emphasizing and repeating that there's not a, I don't think there's a single department head I've spoken to in the six months I've been in office that hasn't said directly or insinuated that they're operating with less staff than they can use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2410.412s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that very much includes our code enforcement officer, singular, you know, for all of the issues, pretty much all of the topics that we've talked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2419.119s">[Kit Collins]</a>: tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2419.499s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so I think, you know, I think President Bears hit the nail on the head.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2422.74s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that, you know, obviously, every every budget season, we're talking about the upcoming fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2428.102s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But if we don't make and save time for these broader longitudinal priorities, then, you know, every year, we're going to keep fighting over individual traffic islands, individual parks patrol, you know, we're going to every low hanging fruit is going to be a fight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2444.209s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so we, we need to tackle that, or we're going to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2450.048s">[Kit Collins]</a>: fighting over the smallest issues, and we should be figuring out how to increase our constituent services to give people the experience that they really deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2461.754s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1450.187s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you President real and thank you for putting this on the agenda tonight, I have to say, advocating against each 1234 is something I thought of as one of my priorities for this entire calendar year in our capacity the city council in my private life to restate some of what's already been said, I think this constitutes one of the biggest assaults on workers rights that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1473.34s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to my knowledge that we have seen in years and years, it's an issue that it's hard for me to contemplate without getting emotional because it is such an insult to the people of this Commonwealth to incite a campaign of, as Councilor Caraviello said, voting against the interests of our neighbours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1491.646s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's an insult to the workers who perform these jobs, who do these gigs, which has become<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1497.468s">[Kit Collins]</a>: one of the backbones of our, you know, modern, local level economy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1501.734s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think that these apps are going away anytime soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1504.699s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think the horse is out of the barn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1506.501s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And what these companies are trying to do through these ballot questions is to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1511.72s">[Kit Collins]</a>: enshrine the chipping away of essential protections, protection from liability, fair wage, just and safe working conditions for all of these people who are doing the rides, delivering the food, you know, often, you know, to people who, you know, they need that that sort of mobility service in order to make their life work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1534.661s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, so I'm glad for this city council to have the ability to get to advocate for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1542.185s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And, you know, as stated this is this is a state issue but it's also of course an issue on the most local level, because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1551.23s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have gig workers in our community, and we have people who are on the consuming end of these companies in our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1559.595s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think one of the other things that propositions like this do is they complicate that question of how do we, as a city, as a constituency, have a relationship with these companies if<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1572.628s">[Kit Collins]</a>: know, wrongdoing is going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1574.249s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so, you know, if people know, this is a quote unquote, small business owner, who's, you know, wrong is blocking the sidewalk, who's, you know, performing badly in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1585.574s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And they know they can't take it to the appropriate person, which would be the company, they know that if there's a finger to point, it's pointing an individual who probably this is, you know, they wouldn't be, you know, doing this job if they had a better, more accessible option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1599.741s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So for so many reasons for protecting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1603.227s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, generations long hard one workers rights workers justice to make sure that we can have a proper working accountable relationship with the companies that are doing business in our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1615.836s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that this is a resolution that we need to pass that we need to follow that up with making sure that h 1234 isn't allowed to distort worker relationships throughout our state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1625.542s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=2709.619s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=2710.48s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Tseng for elevating this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=2713.282s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that this decision really provides an opportunity for us to be proactive for us to clarify the city's policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=2726.84s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that it is not a great position for our city to put itself in, that any person can use our flagpole for any speech at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=2735.524s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that's a huge Pandora's box.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=2738.805s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But to take the first step first, I think that we absolutely need to see a clear policy or a clear response on what our current policy is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=2744.608s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And if we don't have one, I think that's a huge Pandora's box.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=2747.409s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let's take this opportunity to make one to close the door on legal troubles or more back and forth diatribes further down the line, whether that's through an administrative policy or through a clear ordinance that dispels out what our flagpole may be used for and by whom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=2765.753s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So, thank you, Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3061.128s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell, and thank you so much for being here today and giving us this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3066.167s">[Kit Collins]</a>: thorough overview of the work that this bond could help to facilitate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3073.814s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm looking forward to supporting this tonight I just wanted to say I think that the direction that the DPW and the engineering department is taking us in now, both with the sidewalk improvements roster as well as things like the pavement management plan if I'm getting that name right that was released last year I think that those have been very helpful tools for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3093.15s">[Kit Collins]</a>: myself as a representative and also for the communities who are sort of trying to get our arms around these as you say multi multi year projects of addressing the backlog kind of trying to chart that arc of how, where do we go from here and how long is it going to take.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3111.2s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, speaking anecdotally you know and when folks reach out to me and say, you know, my street looks like this, when will that get fixed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3119.426s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is not a task I enjoy to look at the plan and say well you're rated a yellow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3126.972s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So unfortunately that means that it's not this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3129.454s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's a painful thing to have to share at the same time it's helpful, and to go to Vice President Bears this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3136.92s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that it strengthens the case for taking a very thoughtful focused look at how are we going to get to a place where we can sustainably fund capital improvements on a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3149.868s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, non geologic timescale, and also how we're going to fund a more robust city payroll, so that over time we can bring more and more of this work in house if that's what's best for the community and best for infrastructure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3162.677s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So, thank you again and I think that this, as you say, data driven approaches, very useful for us and at least for me, and metabolizing it and sharing it with the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=1630.156s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell, and I appreciate the questions that my fellow Councilors have brought up so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=1636.88s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Since we have our election coordinator here, I'm interested to hear from Coordinator Gale on her perspective on the appointment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=1643.944s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that the election commission is going to be under her purview, so that's kind of a perspective that I think is valuable here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=1651.789s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do want to say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=1656.326s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Clearly, robust participation in municipal elections is extremely important for somebody who can be serving on a board where that is the whole point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=1664.483s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, we live in an environment where participation in municipal elections is at a baseline, incredibly low.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=1670.165s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think that there's perhaps something to be said about this candidate bringing a perspective that could help us to, you know, look at that problem and perhaps, you know, bring the perspective of somebody who's been less involved and looking to get more involved and shed some light on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=1685.07s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But, you know, we'd love to hear from Coordinator Gale on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=1688.471s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=3100.883s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell and I want to thank Councilor Tseng for putting this on the agenda tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=3104.447s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think we're, this council is, you know, enriched by his proximity to the youth community here in Medford and it's always by his proximity to the data, the numbers, because of course, you know, this systemic look at the issue, you know, is exactly what should be guiding our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=3121.377s">[Kit Collins]</a>: resources as a city, our policy directions as a city, and, you know, I think that the city administration in conjunction, put emphasis on, you know, in conjunction with the school department is exactly who I'd like to hear from on this issue from those involved with the Medford Public Schools community and see how we might design policies<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=3140.489s">[Kit Collins]</a>: um to go forward from here you know I think it it doesn't need repeating but I think especially with the issue of mental health mental health crisis which I think over time you know our society like all American societies is coming to reframe it's an issue that has been for a very long time individualized it's been atomized it's been made to feel like people have to deal with this on a very individual level but I think um probably all of our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=3168.28s">[Kit Collins]</a>: lived and anecdotal experience reveals that this is a systemic community wide problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=3175.503s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And, you know, that's how we have to be addressing it if we want to be taking care of our whole community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=3181.285s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=3518.412s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4469.677s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Motion for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5007.319s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5008.28s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I know we've talked about this many times in every type of convening body that we have so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5013.843s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I don't want to repeat myself, but I wouldn't want to give the impression to my fellow Councilors that I happen to disagree with or anybody who's tuning into this discussion that it's been anything less than a thoughtful process for me as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5024.949s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that, you know, especially as a newcomer to the council, respecting the process that predated me, you know, I thank everybody for their comments, for the perspective on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5035.715s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, I think that when we talk about where we want to be growing as a community, like anticipating more growth in our community, you know, if we get our wish and Medford continues to evolve in positive ways and welcome more people and do all the things that I think we want our community to do to improve our curb appeal to continue to revise our zoning to keep pace with, you know, our evolving<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5063.111s">[Kit Collins]</a>: demographic trends and, you know, what an appealing community this is to live in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5067.457s">[Kit Collins]</a>: All of the things that we wish for our community require the substantial work that we do with, you know, this more targeted use of our time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5077.13s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So, you know, when thinking about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5079.882s">[Kit Collins]</a>: how I deal with the community members that come to me as a Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5085.204s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I tend to hear from those constituents about issues that can be resolved through policies and ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5096.449s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just for me as one Councilor, the things that I hear from my constituents about the answer to their issues, if there is one that the council has authority over, the answers<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5107.053s">[Kit Collins]</a>: typically an ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5108.614s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's why my perspective on this has been so heavily weighted towards freeing up additional regular meeting times, reliable meeting times for subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5118.619s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I just wanted to put that on the record again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5120.52s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Wouldn't wanna leave anybody with the impression that this was a less than deliberate decision process for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5128.223s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f6sStXOaVxE&t=123.1s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f6sStXOaVxE&t=124.562s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm excited to recognize Walk, Bike and Roll to School Day, which is the first Wednesday in May.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f6sStXOaVxE&t=130.63s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f6sStXOaVxE&t=131.531s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's a project of the Massachusetts Safe Routes to School program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f6sStXOaVxE&t=135.596s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was thrilled to be contacted by one of the community members who's organizing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f6sStXOaVxE&t=142.521s">[Kit Collins]</a>: celebrations in the form of, you know, group walks to school routes over the course of this whole month on Walking Wednesdays, so I think it's a great time to reflect on how important it is to, you know, in terms of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f6sStXOaVxE&t=157.544s">[Kit Collins]</a>: program goals and still healthy behaviors in our youngest constituents, and also a time to reflect on what we can do on an infrastructural and policy level to ensure that there are always safe, accessible, convenient walking, biking, and rolling routes to schools and every important public place in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f6sStXOaVxE&t=177.83s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=259.895s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=262.457s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1210.011s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1211.152s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I just wanted to note, in general, I actually really do agree with points raised recently by<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1218.868s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Knight, I think that in general, you know, if something comes before us for approval, it shouldn't be a rubber stamp, it should be a reasoned and intentional decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1229.157s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That said, in this specific case, because we didn't hold a Committee of the Whole for the three applicants that were approved last week, I don't know that it would be fair in this case to hold a Committee of the Whole for Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1239.026s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Imani.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1240.928s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would support the motion to table this for only one week to take it back up again in a regular meeting next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1247.652s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just to maintain the consistency, keep things moving along because that's what our newly minted election commission needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1253.915s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But in the future, I would support having more intentional process for approving commissioners for anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1262.32s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1402.312s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1404.874s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1499.147s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=4038.867s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=4041.45s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=4078.403s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=4083.285s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=4085.806s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=4452.629s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=4454.25s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=4457.513s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=259.841s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=261.162s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=262.623s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell, and thank you, Councilor Scarpelli for putting this on the agenda tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=267.007s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is, you know, as we know from last week, an issue that I'm very passionate about as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=271.068s">[Kit Collins]</a>: know, and I think when we're talking about, you know, looking ahead to the opportunity to have a new contract with a waste and recycling hauler, you know, I think you raise a great point, which is that it's not just, you know, what they're doing on their end to make sure that we're recycling and disposing of waste with maximum efficiency, but also making sure that constituents have the knowledge that they need to really take full advantage of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=291.252s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think it's really important that, as you say, an education campaign be a part of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=295.473s">[Kit Collins]</a>: wherever we go from here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=296.474s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just be happy to support this tonight and really looking forward to getting more clarity on the scope of the Solid Waste Task Force from here on out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=305.138s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=585.777s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Chris Emeril.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=3849.272s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell so pretty self explanatory this resolution is just meant to, you know, begin an investigation in subcommittee, you know, with working with members of our business community with the director of economic development to investigate the work that the city and the city council can do to accelerate the growth of our, our downtowns are many squares our business districts, you know, as I think everybody would agree we have some incredible options for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=3874.528s">[Kit Collins]</a>: for dining, for recreation, for nightlife throughout Medford Square, South Medford Square, West Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=3881.152s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But at the same time, one of the things that I hear repeatedly from constituents is, you know, how can we take better advantage of our downtowns?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=3888.316s">[Kit Collins]</a>: How can we take better advantage of Medford Square?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=3890.477s">[Kit Collins]</a>: How can we make it so Medford Square is really more of a destination for people within our community and also for people from outside of our community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=3898.981s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think people would like to see more and different options and really build upon the wonderful base of businesses that we do have in many of our business districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=3907.45s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, so there's a lot to do in the project of transforming our business districts into, you know, even more vibrant and bustling squares obviously that takes into account transportation, it takes into account<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=3919.221s">[Kit Collins]</a>: cycling and pedestrian access, parking, a whole host of issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=3923.662s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This resolution is not meant to get into all of those, but rather just to begin a conversation with the Director of Economic Development, with our business community about what changes this body could potentially investigate, consider, potentially act on to make it easier for new establishments to start and to thrive in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=4072.745s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President real.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=4074.746s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So over the past few weeks we've had discussions in these chambers about how the housing market is playing out in Medford ways that is displacing residents of Medford, and what the city can do to better protect<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=4088.052s">[Kit Collins]</a>: its residents and specifically tenants, you know, and the need to target specific protections at, you know, buildings that are held by commercial corporate landlords.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=4099.018s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So the ordinance that I'm hoping that we can have the chance to discuss in subcommittee would be targeted at codifying protections specifically for tenants of large commercially owned apartment buildings in the event that they're converted into condominiums.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=4111.245s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That is the gist of a condo conversion ordinance, which exists in many communities<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=4117.729s">[Kit Collins]</a>: throughout the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=4119.891s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For example, everywhere from Amherst to Brookline, Malden, Marlborough, Somerville has one, Salem is working on one right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=4127.856s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These exist in places where there's an imperative to make sure that in the event of a large building being converted from a rental into a condo, that the people that are living there just have appropriate, reasonable protections for having a safe and stable off-ramp from that living situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=4146.068s">[Kit Collins]</a>: into their next one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=4147.028s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So like many of the housing measures, like many of the tenant protection measures that we've discussed in this council, this is the type of thing that can be tailored to suit this community, can be tailored to suit the needs of our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=4160.072s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm really looking forward to beginning that conversation in subcommittee with some of the very knowledgeable housing staff that we are lucky to have here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=4167.635s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I humbly ask for my fellow councilors support in beginning to consider this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=4172.756s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=5996.344s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President real, and to the center and thank you for being here and thank you for discussing this with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=6003.031s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm wondering to Councilor to Vice President beers first questions question I also had sort of the the estimate of how big of an impact this loan could make in terms of number of streets number of sidewalks number of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=6017.46s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, areas of ADA compliance where there previously wasn't compliance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=6020.902s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm curious if you think that's the type of thing that we could find an answer to in the next couple of weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=6025.704s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know for myself, that's something that it feels like an important detail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=6029.206s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I understand there's a lot of details to parse through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=6035.249s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If you could just lean in a little bit more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=6036.91s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Certainly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=6037.51s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, sorry about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=6039.13s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, now I hear myself echoing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=6040.591s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was wondering to the question of, you know, what the impact of a load of the size would have in terms of sidewalks repaired, new areas of ADA compliance where there previously wasn't, if you thought that was the type of detail that we could have an answer to within a week or two, or if you think that's part of the further down the line type of answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=6285.038s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you President Rowe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=6287.638s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think where I'm landing on this issue personally, you know, I think my fellow councilors, councilor Caraviello and councilor Scarpelli make many points that I actually really agree with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=6296.983s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I mean, in general, across many, many city departments, I'm, you know, passionately believe in bringing more things in house to, you know, to the greatest extent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=6306.068s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it makes sense fiscally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=6307.408s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's the right thing to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=6308.889s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, whether that's DPW or even our housing resources, I think that these are goals that we need to be holding the administration to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=6316.473s">[Kit Collins]</a>: At the same time, we've already talked about navigability, sidewalk accessibility earlier this meeting in the context of the snow removal ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=6323.276s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that that is a really pressing issue that affects many residents of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=6331.019s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think when we think about accessibility, when we think about equity, navigation accessibility has to be a big part of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=6337.882s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So while I think that there's a lot of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=6342.364s">[Kit Collins]</a>: very important consideration to be had over the topic that this brings up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=6346.908s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would support a motion to approve for first reading tonight because, you know, while there may be a hypothetical better scenario for addressing the issue of our dilapidated sidewalks across the city, I think that, you know, we do have crumbling sidewalks right now that do need to be addressed this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=6368.267s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=6369.888s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would support a motion to approve, but I would also say, you know, for going forward, I think that a better approach is something that we need to continue to prioritize and develop a strategy around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=6381.332s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=6384.033s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=7165.618s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have a motion for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=548.286s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=549.987s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just want to echo Vice President Bears's sentiments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=554.088s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm so excited for the fair share amendment to finally be on the ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=558.65s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, and I think looking at this through the lens of how this would affect the city like Medford, you know, is the perspective that I, you know, that I hope my fellow Councilors and, you know, really every resident and voter in Medford beyond to take into account, you know, public education,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=575.198s">[Kit Collins]</a>: public higher education, roads, infrastructure, hopefully climate change resiliency, you know, these are areas where we need<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=584.606s">[Kit Collins]</a>: new revenue sources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=587.547s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We can't do the things that we need to be the kind of community that we want to be, to live in the kind of community that we want to live in, without revenues for these incredibly important projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=598.352s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And, you know, the source is right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=600.172s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When there's so much need spread throughout our communities, you know, we need to shift from a model of wealth hoarding to a model of making sure that we bring up the baseline for the parts of our communities that are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=612.037s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in most need of investment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=613.418s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I thank Vice President Bears for his advocacy of this, and I'll be excited to vote in support and then vote in support in November as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=621.841s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1436.6s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1438.101s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And thank you, Vice President Bears, for letting everybody know that this is going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1444.105s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For anybody who's interested in learning more about it, I took the survey myself today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1448.107s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It took under 10 minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1450.308s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They have a box to check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1451.189s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are you a constituent from Arlington?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1452.91s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Are you a constituent from Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1455.292s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this is a great thing for our community members to weigh in on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1458.313s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It will affect this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1460.155s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And even going beyond that, this is the type of project that I hope that our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1464.725s">[Kit Collins]</a>: city administration can really look to and be inspired by.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1467.226s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, I think we talk a lot about how much more we could be doing with our riverfront, how much more we want to be doing about traffic calming, pedestrian safety, expanding pedestrian and bike access along our beautiful scenic waterfront.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1481.551s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm excited to see how this is spearheaded by the community of Arlington, how it affects our community positively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1487.633s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and I really hope that we can see projects like this unfolding along the, you know, the riverfront that we control here in Medford as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1495.054s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2272.276s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell, and thank you, Vice President Bears, for going through the resolution so thoroughly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2277.754s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I appreciate you bringing up the context of the mass displacement that we're already starting to see in Medford over the past week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2285.502s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We had residents from the building on Bradley Road, some of whom are in attendance tonight, who were telling us about what they're currently going through with that exact type of situation, with where we are currently in the housing market, the housing crisis coming out of the pandemic as we seem to be doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2301.237s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, mass mass displacement of tenants from our community from the community that they want to live in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2307.559s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And what really shapes me about this whole situation is the fact that, you know, our hands are so tied as Council as a city for what we're able to do to protect the people who live in our community who want to stay here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2319.343s">[Kit Collins]</a>: protect our constituents, the people that we represent, and that's because of these many, you know, potentially more impactful tenant protection, really just constituent protection measures that we're not allowed to do because of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2334.39s">[Kit Collins]</a>: because of decisions affected on the state level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2336.993s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's the reason that these tenant protections are being considered as home rule petitions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2342.559s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For anybody who's unfamiliar, measures such as rent stabilization are illegal in Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2348.505s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think this has been said by others before me, but I think it's a very frustrating position to be in, to be hearing from constituents saying,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2357.387s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We want to stay in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2358.668s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We want to continue being a part of this community and to be so very constrained in what we can do to effectuate helping people stay in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2367.315s">[Kit Collins]</a>: With just the situation that we're currently seeing on Bradley Road, I think it's been incredible coming together of housing advocates, people who've been through this type of situation before, residents coming together to see how they can help one another, mutual aid volunteers, just trying to alleviate a really painful, traumatizing, expensive<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2385.004s">[Kit Collins]</a>: situation for a lot of people, but there's a limit to how much you can volunteer and advocate your way out of a situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2393.368s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's why we need to be advocating for changes to what we as a city are allowed to do to help people stay in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2401.732s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's why I'm excited to take up these potential home rule petitions in the housing subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2407.075s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just to briefly touch on, I know it's a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2411.387s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's not a four letter word, but it's a four letter and numeral word.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2416.868s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I understand that, you know, some of my fellow Councilors would, you know, totally understand my fellow Councilor's perspective on advocating for things at the state level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2427.131s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But, you know, I feel strongly about this one in particular because it directly relates to our authority as a council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2434.252s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's saying, please give us authority back to make decisions about what's right for our community here at the community level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2441.837s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, well, and I'll leave it there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2444.259s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3128.142s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3131.765s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3132.926s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I just wanna echo something that Vice President Bears said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3135.368s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Again, not to belabor the point, the discussion tonight is only whether or not to send this to subcommittee to discuss further.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3141.534s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What if any, hopefully many, in my opinion, I think everybody knows my opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3146.893s">[Kit Collins]</a>: home rule petitions to send to our state delegation in order to say, you know, we need more tools to protect the people who want to stay in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3154.96s">[Kit Collins]</a>: To echo Vice President Beard's point that he just made, you know, for situations like the ones that we're seeing very recently in our community, any one of these would make a difference in the experience of a person who all of a sudden they have to move out of their home, you know, their home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3173.254s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Any one of these could,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3175.78s">[Kit Collins]</a>: alleviate that experience of something traumatizing and heartbreaking happening that you didn't know was going to happen and you had no role in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3184.664s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I also want to say, you know, in the aftermath, and I know these home rule petitions are not about the specific situation that's going on on Bradley Road, but I know that when, you know, myself and my other Councilors first heard about it, I think I'll assume that we all felt sympathy, you know, felt distraught, felt, you know, my gosh, I can't believe that some of my constituents are going to have to leave<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3205.963s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, not because they wanted to, but because they were forced to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3208.445s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think it's important to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3209.646s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We heard from our city housing staff just last week that we can expect this exact same situation to happen again very soon at another large apartment building that was also recently sold elsewhere in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3220.934s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so I just, you know, as perspective for why I feel very passionate about this being on the agenda, being able to discuss this further is because, you know, we can feel upset over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3229.88s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We can feel sympathy for our constituents over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3232.802s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We can feel heartbroken over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3235.312s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But yeah, it's not in my theory of change to not try to do everything that we have in our power to do, even if sometimes we're tilting at windmills, what else can we do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3247.56s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I thank my fellow councilors for their consideration, and I hope that this is something that we can discuss further.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3253.144s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3727.437s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3727.757s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3728.517s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3729.257s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just want to note for the record, I think in a lot of tenant right to purchase policies that have been enacted or discussed in other communities,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3735.395s">[Kit Collins]</a>: exemptions for small owner-occupied properties so that it would be germane only to larger commercial landlords.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5215.936s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5217.497s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanted to quickly make a point for if it's relevant to Councilor Knight's first point that, and please correct me if I'm wrong, but I think during our discussion and committee of the whole, we established that this would only pertain to establishments serving prepared food.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5232.698s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, food for immediate consumption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5234.539s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So it's my impression, I remember we brought this up because we brought up supermarkets in Medford, Wegmans, you know, wanting to make sure that this wouldn't disrupt very large scale supply chains in our neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5245.823s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so it's my impression that this would, you know, I understand that the effects on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5251.189s">[Kit Collins]</a>: restaurants and smaller businesses are extremely important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5253.811s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's why we voted to make an implementation date of July, 2023 with implementation, you know, a year out from that date, but on the point of it affecting these larger retailers, it's my impression that it simply wouldn't apply because they don't, they don't serve prepared food.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6265.738s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell, and I want to thank Councilor Knight for putting this on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6269.04s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As somebody with one marathon under my belt, albeit not very fast and not in Boston, unfortunately, maybe one day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6275.083s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just want to salute all of the runners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6277.505s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I hope you have a great day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6279.726s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I hope that everybody has a wonderful Patriots Day wherever it finds them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6285.189s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=783.054s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1014.778s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1017.599s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Resolution speaks for itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1019.019s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that we're coming up on, you know, we're a bit more than a year out from when our city's waste management contracts will be up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1026.301s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think it's, you know, about time that we start, you know, making sure that the administration is looking at how things are going with our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1034.03s">[Kit Collins]</a>: current contractor with an eye towards how we can improve our overall waste reduction and efficacy of recycling in the next one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1043.753s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That doesn't necessarily mean a new contractor, but I think it's a good time to start re-evaluating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1049.555s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're always overdue for evaluating how we can be further accelerating towards a zero waste future, evaluating how good we are at recycling all the things that we think that we're recycling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1061.059s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also want to make sure that that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1062.524s">[Kit Collins]</a>: also takes into account any private waste haulers that are operating on properties in Medford to ensure that across the board, we're doing what we can to dispose of waste, recycle as efficiently as we can in line with our climate and pollution goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1825.989s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Marillyn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1827.09s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you to our AV wizard back there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1832.574s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What I was saying is that, you know, we appreciate the tenants keeping us informed of your situation and, you know, speaking only for myself and probably for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1841.288s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Many other, if not all of my colleagues, we stand in solidarity with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1845.612s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're sorry for what you're going through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1847.013s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that we need to make sure that you're advocating to the right people, the people with the power to adjust your situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1854.559s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As it's been stated, since this is proceeding legally, there's nothing that we can do in these chambers<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1864.282s">[Kit Collins]</a>: know, to wave a magic wand and give you what you deserve, you know, what you need, what you're asking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1871.864s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that, you know, I'm certainly speaking for myself, I want to be in contact with, you know, this tenant group to make sure that you're connected with the right people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1879.665s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know they've already received some very helpful, you know, what I seem to be like helpful pertinent information from our Office of Planning, Development, Sustainability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1886.527s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I hope that to the extent that's helpful, you can remain in contact with our housing staff, other resources around the city, you know, and I hope that, you know, on an individual Councilor basis, we can stay in contact to make sure that you're accessing the resources that are available to see what can happen here, you know, to appeal to perhaps this property owners that are angels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1911.877s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=3388.631s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I found them in order and I move for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1192.314s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just briefly, thank you for putting this before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1194.875s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1196.427s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So far in my short tenure, it seems like sometimes financial questions have to be considered with haste.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1201.409s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think to the extent that we can not do that, it's a good thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1204.53s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I love the idea of getting ahead of this and having an overview before we have to make such a decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1208.771s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'll look forward to hearing from Chief Assessor Rideau about this in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1773.175s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Tseng for your initiative and putting this on the agenda tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1777.678s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Like Councilor Tseng mentioned, this was in response to direct constituent outreach that I think both of us and possibly others received on this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1784.962s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Again, of constituents just saying, this is an issue we care about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1788.364s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've seen demonstrated attention to this from the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1791.506s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've seen commitment to this from the administration of getting to a place of better representativeness and parity in the people that make up our city administration at all levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1802.899s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and looking for an update on how exactly is that playing out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1806.661s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What are we doing specifically?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1808.601s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What's working?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1809.362s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What are other strategies that we can pursue to continue, to use your word, creating that pipeline of getting representative diverse talent into city positions from the rich variety of backgrounds that exist in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1825.548s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's critically important and I'm really looking forward to an update on the strategies<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1832.28s">[Kit Collins]</a>: city is pursuing to put that into action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1835.561s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2373.477s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2374.938s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And thank you Director Morrison for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2377.56s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for having me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2380.121s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, to me just looking at this appropriation request that's coming from the mayor's office just strictly what's before us today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2387.246s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We have a note of approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2389.625s">[Kit Collins]</a>: from Chief Buckley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2391.446s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's helpful to hear how he puts it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2395.249s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Transferring these funds will alleviate some of the work that's on his staff to do parking enforcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2401.072s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We know we need enforcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2402.914s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We know it's a lot of work to get a brand new apartment up and running.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2405.996s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So, of course, there's more conversations to be had as the parking department continues to get up and running, but I would motion for approval so that your department can do the work it needs to do to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=4370.066s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=4371.414s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and thank my fellow councillors for all the discussion so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=4374.396s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this is really useful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=4375.676s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And to me, it sort of reinforces how much of the need there is for a follow-up conversation so that, you know, to direct, to invite Director Morrison back at a convenient time so that we can, you know, I too have lots of questions about our upcoming parking enforcement, you know, as a South Metro resident, I have lots of questions from,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=4394.85s">[Kit Collins]</a>: my constituents, also my roommate about parking in South Medford, just joking, but actually, but you know, I want us to give you an opportunity to come prepared for that kind of a conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=4405.756s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We can really explore parking writ large, you know, give you time to prepare for that conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=4412.859s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We can really go deep and sort of get ahold of what's to come over the next three, six months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=4417.482s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So, you know, I would,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=4420.41s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, perhaps offered as an amendment or a B paper to invite Director Morrison back maybe in a few months for a discussion about how things have been going, what to expect later in the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=4429.693s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Hopefully we can go over some of our questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=4432.633s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm sure there'll be, you know, even more of a list by that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=4436.014s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Hopefully we'll also go over some of the wins that the department parking department has seen by that time as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=4443.396s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But for the moment, you know, I just wanted to thank you for your time and going over, you know, the details of this proposal and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=4449.539s">[Kit Collins]</a>: know, a motion for us to take up the matter on the table, um, you know, and then reconvene to, uh, get what I'm sure will be a very comprehensive update, uh, in a few months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=5817.684s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=5818.684s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I want to thank Councilor Caraviello for putting this on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=5824.12s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I heard about it from the councilor and just really second to hear about what's befalling these tenants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=5830.384s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, obviously I think that, you know, broader matters of policy will be cold comfort to people dealing with something that they have to act on within 30 days, potentially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=5837.168s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's just a really horrible personal situation that I wouldn't wish upon anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=5840.31s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think, you know, as points that were made by Vice President Bears and Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=5844.472s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Catalo and others, you know, I think that this underscores the work that we urgently need to do as a council to make sure that our city is better insulated<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=5851.129s">[Kit Collins]</a>: from phenomena like this when they happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=5853.07s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I mean, there's a possibility that this is or will turn out to be going forth legally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=5859.971s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that we have to consider that, you know, perhaps one of the best recourses that we can offer our constituents is a more robustly funded housing stability resources in-house, a mediator, better housing stability resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=5874.115s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would love to see a whole office of housing stability, as I've said, since I launched my campaign.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=5878.457s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that we need that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=5879.937s">[Kit Collins]</a>: because as noted, this housing scarcity crisis is not going anywhere anytime soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=5885.06s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We need to do what we can to increase affordable housing citywide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=5888.962s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We need to do what we can from a policy standpoint to make it less catastrophic when things like this happen in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=5894.866s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So again, that doesn't solve a problem happening right now, but I think that it really makes acute the work that we need to do this term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=5904.491s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=6436.796s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, I'm sorry to jump in, but I raised my hand because I was emailing with a constituent about this exact same type of frustrating issue just earlier today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=6445.926s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Shelby, I'm so sorry for your frustration, but because of a similar concern that was brought up on a different street,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=6451.31s">[Kit Collins]</a>: have the opportunity to check in with our engineering department about this where we're at, you know, what's the plan where's the queue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=6458.236s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And, you know, I certainly empathize with the frustration of looking out on a street that's full of potholes and saying when is this going to get attended to my curiosity was also you know when are we going to see an order of which you know streets are going to get addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=6471.976s">[Kit Collins]</a>: um, got a helpful, if not satisfying response from our engineering department, which is just, you know, there's, there's a plan in place and due to, you know, systemic funding issues, it's going to be meted out over, um, a fairly long timetable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=6484.725s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think this is perhaps something that it would be, you know, a service to many constituents on many roads throughout our city to just check in with the engineering department, maybe get a report back to give some constituents a sense of, you know, who's in the short term queue and, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=6499.882s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, who's more in the midterm in terms of getting their streets addressed as to the question of how to get a single pothole filled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=6508.149s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm curious whether councilors think that'd be more of a see quick fix issue that might be a shorter term solution that councilors, or sorry, that constituents can use to get a more one-off problem addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1010.95s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1013.212s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=3014.691s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Alicia, thank you so much for this very helpful<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=3019.12s">[Kit Collins]</a>: thorough presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=3020.001s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I have just two clarifying questions to make sure I'm understanding this correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=3024.684s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So looking at this map, to become eligible for these grants, we would need to create zoning that would allow within each of these circles for say 6,400 units of single family housing to be built within each circle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=3041.745s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is that my understanding?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=3084.261s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=3085.062s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that gets at my second question, which is, you know, we have these radii here, but you also said the districts don't have to be contiguous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=3093.689s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So it sounds as though that gets us the confusion that you just mentioned, which is it's not necessarily clear that all of that as of right housing has to be encompassed within that circle, but maybe start there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=3105.359s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And so, of course, that's something I'd also<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=3107.878s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's that's part of what it exists, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=3176.672s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Gotcha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=3177.232s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=3177.492s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=3523.71s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanted to thank Director Hunt for coming before us and explaining all of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=3527.271s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And as you said, if you could follow up with these slides and how to submit comments, I think that'd be really appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=3531.513s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But thank you again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=5394.506s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=5702.498s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=5704.34s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Last week, myself, Councilor Caraviello, Councilor Tseng, along with Police Chief Buckley, members of Medford People Power, some folks they've been working with at the ACLU, and Attorney Austin from KP Law met to discuss the proposed community control over public surveillance ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=5721.311s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We had a very productive first discussion, and I look forward to further meetings of the subcommittee to continue going over questions and concerns related to the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=338.329s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=514.137s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=542.066s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1084.03s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1084.27s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I want to thank Councilor Caraviello for bringing this up tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1087.612s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was interested in this resolution because, you know, over the course of particularly in the past couple of years with the pandemic, from my work in the community, I've heard about different sorts of energy and fuel assistance programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1097.577s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I went on the city website to see, you know, what's current, what's available, what's easy to find, and it's not easy to find.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1104.34s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So if those fuel assistance programs are available, we should make it really easy for people to find them because as you note,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1110.899s">[Kit Collins]</a>: more and more people are in greater and greater need of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1113.461s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We should make it easy, we should make it navigable, make it visible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1116.403s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm really interested to hear that update from the administration, not just on what's available, but also on some of the programs that were really broadcasted during the peak of COVID, what's still relevant, and if not, what's taken that place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1128.21s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So looking forward to getting this update from the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1130.672s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3200.223s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3200.563s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And thank you, Molly, for that very thorough presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3202.885s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm excited to hear that the slides will be available online because there's a lot to plumb through and I'm sure I'll be revisiting it to get caught up on all the nuts and bolts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3211.553s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You answered a lot of the questions that I had in terms of what specific programs are and aren't eligible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3217.938s">[Kit Collins]</a>: One of the things that's on my mind, which I'm sure is one of the many things that isn't yet set in stone is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3223.523s">[Kit Collins]</a>: kind of a more specific timeline for the community engagement piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3226.867s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Some of the questions that I've been hearing from residents are, you know, it's so great that this is going to be a participatory process, but what is it going to look like and how will I know that my feedback is being, you know, really incorporated, not just received and then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3240.041s">[Kit Collins]</a>: put in a filing cabinet somewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3242.484s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm sure the timeline for making those decisions is still being finessed, but do you have any sort of preliminary thoughts about, you know, if there's lots of ideas that are compelling and meet the requirements and perhaps are mentioned in a previous program like the social justice roadmap or the Medford comprehensive plan, what the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3264.104s">[Kit Collins]</a>: what the decision process will be like for prioritizing among many good ideas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3271.186s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And if that's not a today question, that's also fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4423.208s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, President Morell, and thank you for reading out the entire list exhaustively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4428.012s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, we had the pleasure of hearing about all of these projects that are Committee of the Whole last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4434.537s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We approved them unanimously, find them all very meritorious, a lot of them really exciting projects that I think we're all excited to see unfold in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4444.806s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So if there's no comment or question at this point, or, you know, borrowing any comments from members of the public who are here today, I would motion for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=13.357s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=1201.598s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you and thank you for outlining you know just how recurrent this issue is in some of the neighborhoods that we and I'm sure many other Councilors also frequent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=1210.843s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Obviously our engineering department and our DPW have a full queue of traffic mitigation and repaving projects that they're actively working on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=1218.208s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're lucky to have them on the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=1220.869s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Still the area that we've described is very pernicious one for traffic jams as already touched on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=1226.391s">[Kit Collins]</a>: creates buildups at every peak hour, spills over onto these cut through streets like Bonner Avenue and others, degrades the road surfaces, increases air pollution for the residents of these neighboring streets, and creates very dangerous driving situations like blind turns, impatient behavior behind the wheel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=1242.342s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So obviously there's no magical solutions, but looking forward to getting some updates from our city staff on what's currently going on to address these issues and hopefully explore what more can be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=1253.069s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=1254.15s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Favrello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2485.735s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2486.755s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Was Vice President Bears first?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2488.916s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2489.777s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2491.338s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well, thank you, Councilor Svang for putting this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2493.599s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for the comments so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2497.1s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I just feel the need to say off the top, you know, I think, you know, given the fact that this is data that's been reported by the state, you know, I think it's a little unfair to call it a fishing expedition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2507.205s">[Kit Collins]</a>: when this is data that, you know, is now out in the open, you know, it's not something that Medford requested, it's just something that we have access to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2513.609s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And, you know, to me, since this is out there, it's a state report, greater transparency and dialogue around the issue can only be positive for the whole community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2522.694s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just having the data and not following up on it doesn't help anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2525.936s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm encouraged that the report recommends reflection and conversation about the potential causes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2533.2s">[Kit Collins]</a>: of these disparities and gives us a lot of opportunities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2535.422s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's the opportunity for the public to follow up on a concerning issue, you know, demonstrated in the data and get more insight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2543.089s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's the opportunity for our city to investigate and better learn what is the cause of the patterns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2548.394s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As Councilor Tseng said, you know, it's not about blame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2550.796s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's about asking what's behind this data, going with an open mind and saying what's behind it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2556.921s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And it's an opportunity for the MPD to share its perspective, share what goes into its work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2561.644s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I completely agree with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2562.644s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know there's been a lot of new hires.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2564.425s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've heard from the chief firsthand, you know, how dedicated he is to really comprehensive training.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2570.428s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we know that that's genuine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2571.889s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think it would be great to have a forum to share that with more of the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2575.847s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So, you know, to me, building and improving ties between MPD and the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2580.889s">[Kit Collins]</a>: That's an existing stated goal that I've heard from many people within the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2585.27s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that, you know, a conversation like the report recommends is is walking the talk, you know, following up on the issue holding a forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2594.503s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I really do think it could be a win win because at the end of the day building trust keeps the community safer and it also keeps our public safety professionals safer on the job as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=2603.353s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=4735.918s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well, I'm very impressed by Councilor Tseng's French speaking, so hard to follow that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=4740.42s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I just want to amplify what Councilor Tseng already said and want to thank him for taking initiative on this resolution, as well as for liaising with the other Greater Boston elected officials that are connected to the Haitian community and this coalition, who've been making similar appeals to our federal administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=4756.465s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would be really proud for us to use our voice as a council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=4760.026s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to advocate for a more just and fair and legally compliant immigration system, instead of seeing excuses be used to turn away people who came here in a time of need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=4770.572s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And as stated in the resolution, Medford has very long served as a place of refuge for immigrants, immigrants from many, many different places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=4778.977s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And federal immigration policy impacts the ability of communities, welcoming communities like ours, to open our arms to new community<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=4787.462s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And of course, it is very relevant that so many Medford residents are a part of the Haitian diaspora.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=4793.945s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Kind of anecdotally, one of the most memorable conversations that I had when I was out talking to voters last year was with a Haitian man in my neighborhood in South Medford who, when I asked him what was on his mind with the city of Medford, said, I have relatives who want to come and join me here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=4810.112s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And because of our immigration policy, they can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=4813.173s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I could see that it was a really heartbreaking issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=4816.056s">[Kit Collins]</a>: um and it was it's it stuck with me more than you know most other conversations<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=4820.952s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So obviously it goes without saying that cities cannot directly affect federal immigration policy, but especially as representatives of the city with such a robust Haitian population, I think that the very least we can do is speak up and to hope that with other local leaders across greater Boston, Metro Boston speaking up as well, that these calls will accumulate and be heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=4840.5s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And, you know, just to recognize that this policy is still affecting people in our community, even when it's left the front pages of major national newspapers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=4848.524s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=5110.355s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Madam President, and thank you to everybody who's commented so far and yeah I just really wanted to you know again just focus back on the, the language of the resolution and just I think what I found, of course it's a somewhat complicated issue what I think you know the important thing to focus on is that the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=5128.353s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, kind of the ask here is to say, you know, let, we should be letting all immigrants, especially those applying for asylum to go through that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=5136.778s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If that process is not being allowed, that's a problem all immigrants should have the right to go through the asylum seeking process so it's not, you know, any sort of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=5146.423s">[Kit Collins]</a>: blanket this one action should occur for all immigrants this one shouldn't it's just the option should be open that's what it means to be an equitable and welcoming country and to, you know, do right by what we say we say we're trying to do as a country and as society and just you know also just to focus in on the text of the resolution I don't think this is you know an attempt to re litigate any of the actions of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=5169.347s">[Kit Collins]</a>: past administrations or even present ones, but just to say, you know, because of the trickle-down effects of all federal policies on our local ones, this is what we're advocating for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=5179.829s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And on a more personal note, you know, I completely appreciate and respect, you know, councillors who want to keep the purview of what we put on the agendas here to just super local issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=5190.332s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I really do understand that and I respect it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=5193.293s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As I've stated before, you know, my personal posture is that I do want to take the opportunity to advocate for policies that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=5199.394s">[Kit Collins]</a>: affect our community, even if they are things that we do not have authority over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=5203.018s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I take that as an explanation for why I put on and co-sponsor resolutions like these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=5208.703s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I do hope that in some indirect way, declarations like these do have a cumulative effect in getting the ear of people higher up in government to say, this is what I need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=5217.131s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is what we're seeing on the ground in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=5219.954s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And this is how to make our local levels safer for everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=5223.917s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=6326.317s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just one last thing before I move for approval I just wanted to state for the record you know that I, I've stated my explanations for why I support resolutions like these but I think you know, personally I think that there's like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=6340.081s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's no reason why a genuine commitment and passion for service showing up for the community can't co-exist with a decision to not want to put forth as many advocacy resolutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=6355.909s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think I chalk it up to a difference of strategic opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=6360.352s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I just wanted to put that out there and for my fellow councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=6712.621s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I found them to be in order and I moved for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1353.932s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, I just like to thank Councilor Knight for putting this on the agenda tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1356.996s">[Kit Collins]</a>: In my view, you know, there's no, there's no bad opportunity to thank and commend the healthcare workers in our midst, especially right here in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1364.404s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think it would be our honor to commend them here in the council chambers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1368.229s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=4835.667s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you and thank you for coming to speak with us tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=4837.89s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just to give you, you know, I think I was the one that put 22059 and some others directed at our state house delegations leaders in the state house on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=4847.681s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just to give you a window into my thinking, I want to see the council advocating for measures that I think would improve life for people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=4855.089s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in Medford, in my view, and I know that not even all the other Councilors on this body feel the same way, but to me, part of my role as a Councilor is advocating for measures that will improve life for people who live at Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=4866.258s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Often that's going to include things that we can do within this body, within our purview, in the form of a resolution or an ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=4872.223s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Other times that's going to mean advocating for something that is the state's authority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=4876.646s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So, you know, to me, I think it's analogous to, you know, when I call up<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=4880.459s">[Kit Collins]</a>: my representative, you know, and tell her how I think about a bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=4883.1s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I hope that she takes it into the count.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=4884.601s">[Kit Collins]</a>: When we happen to send a letter that we vote in favor on to our state delegation, we might hope that they might take that into account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=4890.945s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=4891.545s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's no algorithm, but we hope so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=4893.626s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=4894.067s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You answered the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1314.52s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1317.403s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'd support the motion to move this to a committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1319.745s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think Councilor Scarpelli raises a point that I've heard from multiple sources that, you know, our best chance for passing a home rule petition for charter review is to pass it with unanimous vote from the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1331.416s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, respectfully, I hope that we're able to get to seven zero because as, you know, as Councilor Scarpelli, as President Morell already said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1339.924s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's been a long, long time since we've reviewed this foundational code of our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1345.891s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've heard from a lot of constituents just over the past week about this and a lot more ever since I started campaigning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1353.0s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this is a really top priority issue for a lot of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1357.23s">[Kit Collins]</a>: who live in Medford, you know, one raised, I think, you know, perhaps the most salient point of all, which is, you know, any important binding legal document, it's a good idea to review it every once in a while, kind of like we're currently doing with our code of zoning ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1371.619s">[Kit Collins]</a>: To me, there's simply no reason not to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1374.641s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And, you know, this home rule petition is just to the question of, do we give Medford an opportunity to review that charter or not?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1382.026s">[Kit Collins]</a>: it's not, you know, we're not weighing in on what should come out of that Charter Review Commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1386.029s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So, you know, I hope that we can take steps to give a strong vote on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1390.973s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And, you know, I know I'll be voting in favor and excited to present this opportunity to the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3622.128s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you and thank you President we're all we're putting this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3624.71s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to concur with a lot of Councilors have really just said, I also just want to note I think that this is a problem that's felt differently in different neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3632.317s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I live in South Medford renter most people on my street are renters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3636.061s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that this is a very I think that you know the parking enforcement during snowstorms is felt really differently like depending on the character of a neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3644.228s">[Kit Collins]</a>: A lot of my neighbors did not move their cars because they had no idea that we're having a snow emergency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3651.037s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I've had people reaching out to me on Twitter to ask about parking policies and I think if people are reaching out to little old me on Twitter it's because they have no idea where to look for that information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3660.689s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I can sympathize because as a digital native almost, as a millennial, I struggled a couple of years ago to find where to sign up for city alerts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3669.516s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm probably about as plugged into city stuff as anybody in my age group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3674.12s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I agree, I think this should be coordinated with other citywide communications because I think the need for signage, and I do think there are some neighborhoods where it would be kind of the only thing that people see about it, shows that we have a pretty big communication gap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3689.173s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in our city for alerts like this in general.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4467.401s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4467.701s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And thank you, President Morell for putting this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4470.224s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'd certainly second your motion for approval if there's a motion already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4474.087s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that it's a good idea to put this forward, you know, regardless of the recent change in the proposal, you know, as articulated by councilors already, the plan has changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4482.395s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's a good idea for us to say in one voice as a council, you know, we need to stand up for the spirit of the Community Benefits Agreement that Wynne entered into.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4490.342s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4892.175s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'll be brief, but as a person who in my other work,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4897.748s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4900.069s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What was that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4901.99s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Oh, wait, is that a rule?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4909.734s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Well, you made me lose my train of thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4911.175s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was going to say, thank you, Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4917.461s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As a person who does public art professionally, I thank Councilor Tseng for bringing this forward and I agree, you know, from my own experience and from talking to other people in the field, you know, public art can really seem like a black box to people, you know, amateur artists, professionals who are trying to get into the field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4933.049s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also think that with so many other things, equity is a huge issue in the public art field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4938.598s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, anything that we can do to further our efforts to be transparent about the process can help more people in the community both take on these opportunities and also weigh in on what kind of public art we wanna see in our community and where, so I think it's a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6166.219s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6333.68s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6335.541s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would like to move to approve this measure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6337.982s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was pleased to testify in favor of H3080 a couple of weeks ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6341.923s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's an extremely important set of bills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6344.765s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They just provide a local option for municipalities to receive a more fair compensation rate from their large resident nonprofits, as we're all very aware.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6354.909s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Municipalities bear a very heavy governmental load for the amount of resources that they're able to command.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6361.291s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And these bills will help straighten our city municipalities like ours by providing a framework for wealthy resident nonprofits to pay their fair share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6369.555s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think it would be a great idea for this council to send a strong message to the state delegation of, you know, what an asset this framework would be to communities like ours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6378.74s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6965.568s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6969.648s">[Kit Collins]</a>: enthusiastic readers of the Massachusetts Municipal Association weekly newsletter already now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6976.432s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We are predicted to have a huge uptick in state tax collections for the upcoming fiscal year compared to the current one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6983.375s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's a particularly dramatic increase compared to original projections for the fiscal year 2022 tax collections forecast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6990.399s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And even if you only consider the calculation of the tax base that was used to actually create<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6995.361s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the fiscal year 2022 state budget, it's still over a 7% increase from that number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7000.163s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Meanwhile, the level of state aid afforded to municipalities barely keeps pace with inflation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7008.227s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Again, I wanna note how the past couple of years have highlighted just how much responsibility for policy and governance rests at the most local level of governance, particularly when it comes to public health, resiliency, roads, environmental maintenance, really essential services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7023.473s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that we need to not only maintain but actually expand if we're going to do right by our community and our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7029.934s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I hope that ours and other municipalities can successfully communicate to our state leaders the need to increase the level of local aid in next year's state budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7039.536s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I hope that other municipalities will join with ours, hopefully, in advocating for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7044.537s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I respectfully ask for my fellow councilors' support in advocating this to our state leaders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7050.458s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7159.551s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7161.513s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So as many folks are no doubt already aware, February 3rd and 4th marked the two-year anniversary of our city's pledge to become hunger-free by 2028.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7173.065s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Really grateful to the school committee, city council that were in effect at the time in 2020, as well as Mayor Lungo-Koehn for making this commitment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7181.613s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And also, you know, just want to express gratitude for the members and collaborators of the Medford Food Security Task Force for their work behind the scenes raising this issue of food security in Medford, you know, both prior to the pledge and, you know, in the time after it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7196.862s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As everybody who's working on the issue of hunger and food insecurity and Medford, you know, knows as well as anybody, there's a lot of work that we still have to do to reach the goal of actually being, you know, free of hunger and food insecurity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7209.905s">[Kit Collins]</a>: in the next six years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7212.167s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We've had some great gains, the Mystic Community Market being among them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7215.469s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's still a very far way to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7219.093s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So, especially given that budget season is, you know, going to be upon us before we know it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7224.135s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just think that this is an opportunity for us to state that this is a very strong priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7228.036s">[Kit Collins]</a>: There's no quick fixes when it comes to eradicating the issue of hunger.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7232.658s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But we need to, you know, invest what needs to be invested convene the groups and conversations that need to be convened to figure out what exactly are the obstacles to eradicating hunger in our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7242.361s">[Kit Collins]</a>: and then, you know, hopefully make haste to do the work of the economic development and programs and policies that will make going hungry in Medford a thing of the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7251.264s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for your consideration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7481.095s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If I may, motion to take from the table papers 21-631, second 21-631, and 22-023.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7483.638s">[Kit Collins]</a>: On the motion of Councilor Collins, same papers 21-631, 21-631, and 20-... Sorry, one second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8087.953s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=10.486s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1318.251s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, and thank you, Vice President Bears for introducing this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1322.616s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just want a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1325.619s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1326.54s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes, just a second everything that Vice President Bears already said this resolution is to create a public process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1336.111s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, so to create, you know, a routinized way to have a clear routine process for any agency that wishes to deploy a public surveillance technology to outline why they would like to use it, for what purpose, how this information will be collected and used to make sure that we have a very clear and structured process to bring the public into that deliberation and decision process when surveillance technologies are proposed for use in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1363.63s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's a great transparency measure, and I'd like for it to be taken up by the Public Safety and Community Health Subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1491.312s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1492.913s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is a bill that I've heard about from many Medford residents, and I see it as being very in line with our community's values so I'm glad for the opportunity to request my fellow Councilors support in endorsing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1504.517s">[Kit Collins]</a>: For a little bit of background, this act would shore up basic civil rights protections for undocumented people throughout the state, and of course, by inclusion, our community as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1514.295s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, currently, insecurity about immigration status and the specter of deportation keeps many people from seeking the help and support that they need from police, from medical providers, and in other settings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1525.479s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this act would restrict the circumstances during which law enforcement is allowed to inquire about a person's immigration status.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1533.142s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, you know, essentially the act would make it so people less feel like they have to, uh, you know, avoid calling for help when they're in crisis because of what that call could result in in terms of an arrest or deportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1544.832s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Um, so I see the measures of this act as being very aligned with our community's existing goals of making sure that our public safety and health resources can actually reach every and any person in Medford who needs it regardless of their background.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1557.642s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I respectfully, uh, ask for my fellow Councilors approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2363.817s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President, thank you, Councilor Tseng for putting this forward and just want to echo all of that and also add that I think one of the reasons this is you know important and relevant to our community here in Medford is, as Councilor Tseng mentioned this bill would require that electric bus fleet to be expedited for routes that go through environmental justice communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2381.665s">[Kit Collins]</a>: including some of our neighbors in Somerville and Everett, and so adjacent communities close to those cities in Medford or those that share bus routes through those neighborhoods would also reap the benefits of this priority electrification for those transit routes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2395.775s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So respectfully ask for our fellow councilors support for this bill, especially as Vice President Bears mentioned during this final week of pushing bills out of subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2549.496s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm not aware that it is the assessment for any of the impacted communities at all I think that this is a statewide plan for procuring and implementing in a staggered way the electrification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2559.443s">[Kit Collins]</a>: of the buses, the bus charging stations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2562.304s">[Kit Collins]</a>: To my knowledge from reading the text of the bill, didn't mention anything about the assessment of the community's fees to the MBTA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2913.54s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes, I'd like to thank Councilor Tseng for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2917.102s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, I think you said it very well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2919.444s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Black history and Medford's history are inextricably woven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2922.586s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'd be proud to see Black History Month be celebrated even more loudly in our community and to have this be a moment for recommitting to investing in black voices, black futures, standing together against bigotry and systemic injustice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2937.316s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'd move for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4406.302s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4407.183s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Tseng for putting this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4409.024s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This was very interesting to read through and learn about, and I appreciate your rundown of the resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4416.149s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This is something I'd very much like to see our administration work towards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4419.752s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's very aligned with our social justice roadmap, our goals of becoming an ever more equitable community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4425.536s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And as you very helpfully described, disaggregating data into more specific<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4430.199s">[Kit Collins]</a>: national, racial, ethnic groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4432.46s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This arms us with better data to act upon through policy, through planning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4436.943s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, essentially the point of having all of this demographic information is so we can look beyond the line of best fit and see what's underneath it for really specific populations, you know, and respond appropriately through our governance and our program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4449.329s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'd love to see a response from the administration about what it would take to adopt this improved data, improved reporting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4455.373s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4455.693s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4810.37s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Not sure if this should go before or after public participation, but motion to take from the table papers 21-631 and 22-023 for third reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4968.247s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just want to, of course, if any Councilors need another week to review it, I don't want to rush the decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4973.789s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But being as a lot of the positions under these ordinances are related to public health, the public health nurse, food security specialist positions are included in these amendments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4984.553s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These are positions that I've heard that the community is really clamoring to be filled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4988.336s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it's really urgent that we get these processed, be able to hire for them really as quickly as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4993.159s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These are some positions that are really addressing urgent needs in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4996.921s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If it's possible even to, you know, maybe review the documents in this meeting and then move forward, you know, I don't want to be ham-fisted about this, but if there's any way to move forward with a measure of urgency, I'd really, you know, appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5087.566s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is there a question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5089.447s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is there a way to motion for these to put on next week?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5093.968s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If you withdraw,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1082.193s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, and thank you Councilor Caraviello for bringing this forward today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1085.777s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this resolution is important, obviously we need to make sure that every city vehicle is a safe vehicle, and I support measures to ensure that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1094.906s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also want to thank Councilor Tseng and President Morell for their<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1100.157s">[Kit Collins]</a>: amendments, you know, of course, as we all know, resources are finite, needs are many, so I support, you know, I'd be interested to see this purchase plan, a phased in purchasing plan in the context of an overall capital budget, just to see how it interacts with other funding priorities, including other funding priorities within the MPD, which I know are many at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1121.772s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also wanted to note, you know, kind of to President Morell's point, of course, yearly vehicle purchases, even if they're phased in, they're no small thing environmentally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1130.395s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And, you know, there is a huge emissions cost baked into high volume vehicle manufacturing, you know, even for EV vehicles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1136.157s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So regardless of how this goes forward, obviously, patrol cars are a bit of a non-negotiable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1141.86s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I think that that's something that I'd really like to see acknowledged and accounted for in our overall path to net zero emissions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1147.883s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just wanted to note that for the record, regardless of how we go forward, I think that'd be a valuable thing for us to, for the administration to consider in their purchase plan of these vehicles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1156.206s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1637.019s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was also just seconding but I agree with everything and I'd said I think these are four extremely worthy projects, very excited to support them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1844.1s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Mr. President, if I may, motion to take from the table papers 21631 and 22023 for the purpose of surgery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1852.805s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Those aren't eligible till next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1854.546s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Next week?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1864.839s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's already February in my mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=857.753s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, and thank you, Mr. Ortiz, for being on the call and answering our questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=863.298s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I was wondering, and I apologize if you're not the person to whom this question should be directed, but I was wondering if there's a standard protocol that you follow for informing the residents that are adjacent to your work site of the work that you're doing, work schedule, what they should expect from the work being done on their street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=882.795s">[Kit Collins]</a>: if that's something that is usually farmed out to your city liaisons, sort of what the residents can expect if the permit is to be granted and if work goes ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=956.05s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1663.777s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes, just wanted to thank Councilor Knight for bringing this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1665.818s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I also have questions about how this contract overlaps or intersects or otherwise with the provisions laid out in 30B section 12.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1675.582s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What's changed by it being grant funded?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1678.903s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What parts of that provision apply or not?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1680.904s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm looking forward to receiving a determination on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=2525.29s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, and thank you, Councilor Caraviello for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=2529.316s">[Kit Collins]</a>: As you said, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=574.342s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=576.123s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Before we vote, I'd just like to voice, you know, one thing that I heard from Chief of Staff Nazari in our discussion on this proposal last week was a concern that failure to quickly pass this budget amendment would<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=591.272s">[Kit Collins]</a>: leave the administration short on legal counsel in the short term or maybe for the rest of the fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=596.897s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that is a concern of mine because I could see a lot of circumstances where having, you know, any department in the city having insufficient access to legal counsel on a variety of matters could really hold us up and, you know, any numerous important issues that we're trying to work on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=612.21s">[Kit Collins]</a>: over the next five, six months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=614.171s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So that is a concern of mine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=617.172s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And that's why I'm leaning towards trying to pass this expediently, because I totally agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=621.753s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'd like to see us lobby for independent counsel for this council going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=626.495s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But I do have pretty strong reservations about, you know, delaying passage of the amendment and ripple effects that that could have for the administration in the short term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=635.998s">[Kit Collins]</a>: If I can point information with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=656.253s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=658.155s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=664.16s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1596.927s">[Kit Collins]</a>: from the chair uh oh sorry councillor collins sorry i was a late breaking hand raised yeah um i just wanted to to also note that i really appreciate the discussion around this and to my fellow councillors i hope that my willingness to approve quickly i would never want for that to come across as indifference to the frustration that's been built up over the years and i've<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1619.632s">[Kit Collins]</a>: want to acknowledge and respect the fact that there's been back and forth on this issue for years that I wasn't behind the rail for, and I want to know that that's heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1628.279s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I'm glad that Councilor Tseng earlier brought up the need to advocate for a fiscal year 2023 budget in which these concerns are really taken seriously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1638.787s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think I'd like to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1641.869s">[Kit Collins]</a>: motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1642.79s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But, you know, again, want to reiterate, um, you know, I have a concern that this could ripple out into a interruption in service for the residents of this city that's behind my position tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1653.175s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But, you know, I'm hoping that as a council we can advocate for independent legal counsel for going forward is obviously that's very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2868.095s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Vice President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2870.674s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for reading that whole thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2874.037s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So this resolution is not intended to point fingers or rehash an incident that we already know about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2882.366s">[Kit Collins]</a>: This resolution is intended to follow up on the work that the administration has begun in the wake of the offensive menorah display.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2888.392s">[Kit Collins]</a>: at the holiday extravaganza in December.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2890.835s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We're aware that the administration has taken some good first steps and to move forward from that event, including starting the conversation with representatives from Temple Shalom da Marion Ryan, the anti defamation league and city hall staff and beginning to plan some trainings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2907.534s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My intent is to affirm that the goal here should be to create a culture of inclusion and broad community engagement within City Hall, and with the planning of city events specifically, so much so that offensive incidents like the menorah display are just not possible to happen anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2924.271s">[Kit Collins]</a>: aspire for this administration to have such strong relationships across our many faith and cultural and ethnic communities and be so and get so good at inviting people into City Hall and to our event planning processes that this kind of unfortunate yet human error wouldn't ever make it into the final version of a city event.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2944.155s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm happy to see that the work to move forward has begun and we want to confirm that this work is really necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2950.076s">[Kit Collins]</a>: not just because of the menorah display and to heal ties with the Jewish community members who were alienated by it, but rather that, you know, to say that it's necessary in any case to make this city hall a place where people from any background can feel represented and feel belonging because that's what a city hall really needs to be to be successful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2968.888s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So finally, you know, we want to request that update from the administration on what the next steps are to continue improving inclusion and engagement with the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2977.133s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3482.865s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you and thank you councillor saying for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3486.108s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that this is a great thing to see the city lead on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3490.072s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I too have heard the recent guidance about how it's true, and 95, but you know more to the point KN 95 are more protective and surgical masks they're certainly more protective and cloth masks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3501.463s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think at the point that you know we're trying to the administration is trying to do all it can to keep our residents, safe, correct masking is a huge part of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3512.63s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And we have to evolve our guidance with the evolving nature of the virus with the infection levels in our community and I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3519.595s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Tseng brings up a great point that it's increasingly difficult to find masks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3524.718s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think people are feeling kind of out in the wind when it comes to being able to source masks that will protect them, that will help them not keep the virus, not bring the virus home to their families, you know, kind of regardless of vaccination status, because that's where we're at in this pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3539.728s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I think if there is a, if there's a way for this administration to source masks so that we can better protect the people in our community,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3548.593s">[Kit Collins]</a>: that are most in need of them, people who can't work from home, people who work for the municipality, work for our schools, people who are disproportionately likely to be in infection prone scenarios.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3560.919s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We need to be doing all that we can to help protect those community members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3565.622s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you, Councilor Tseng, and I'll be strong in support of this today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3891.164s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3892.125s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And, you know, I think some of the last points that you raised really speak to the heart of this, which is, you know, what being able to track and assess what are we doing, what's left to do, how can we help more?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3903.236s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I also want to echo a comment that President Morell made on the previous paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3908.074s">[Kit Collins]</a>: regarding how truly tragic it is that so much of the pandemic response has been left to local governments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3915.678s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I certainly hope that we can take these lessons forward as a nation for our next, God forbid, public health emergency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3923.581s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But as the case is that a lot of responsibility has fallen on the shoulders of our local boards of health nationwide, we still need to be saying, how can we bring up the baseline?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3933.206s">[Kit Collins]</a>: How can we make sure that we're achieving an equitable response<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3935.687s">[Kit Collins]</a>: how much more can we be doing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3937.408s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'd love to see this administration look into keeping up the vaccination clinics, continuing to reevaluate our mask mandates, ability to share and distribute medical resources, looking into PCR testing for our community, the things that are very, very hard for residents to find on their own.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3956.076s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you again for bringing this up, Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=4189.247s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I found them to be in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=4193.008s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I move to approve them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=364.315s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Bears?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=366.036s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Capiello?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=367.117s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=376.084s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Schell-Kelley?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=378.726s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Councilor Tseng? President Bears??<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=608.896s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1760.284s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1810.312s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2541.264s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor, thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2546.113s">[Kit Collins]</a>: not to drive the conversation out further, but I just want to thank President Morell, Councilor Bears for bringing this forward, Councilors Knight and Scarpelli for their words of affirmation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2556.276s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that this is an issue that really deserves a lot of affirmatory words.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2560.718s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think this is a really essential benefit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2563.239s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I would love to see this council embrace it, encourage the city to embrace it, because this is a measure that could, through extending this benefit for our city and school employees, help to make the city<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2576.024s">[Kit Collins]</a>: healthier and stronger and more resilient community, which is what we're here to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2580.172s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you for bringing it forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2581.715s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm excited to advance it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3775.019s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3775.559s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Knight for bringing this forward wholeheartedly support this resolution, as indicated, not only do these leaks account for an outsized amount of methane emissions, particularly potent greenhouse gas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3788.962s">[Kit Collins]</a>: These leaks inhibit our ability to deliver on our public health goals to the community of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3793.543s">[Kit Collins]</a>: They also threaten our ability to demonstrate our seriousness about climate change mitigation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3797.484s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I look forward to supporting the city administration and holding National Grid accountable and seeing what we can do to sustainably address this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3807.207s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3927.534s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5648.124s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5649.466s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Through the chair, I guess I'd like to ask for a clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5652.31s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm not sure if that would be from Councilor Caraviello and Scarpelli or Chief of Staff Mina.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5659.76s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's my understanding that the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5662.162s">[Kit Collins]</a>: $2,500 that the mayor is requesting the appropriate is for a distinct attorney to represent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5705.495s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So- Understood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5706.535s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think my confusion is around, is the sticking point here, whether this is attorney that's contracted with the city of Medford, or if it's an attorney that we are in effect sharing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5825.081s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'd like to hear from the Chief of Staff, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5919.71s">[Kit Collins]</a>: No further questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5920.47s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you very much for the clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9050.38s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you, and through the chair, thank you for your response tonight for being here to help clarify some of the issues surrounding this in considering this paper I think for me it's a matter of balancing or what's in my mind is the short term necessity of not having a service interruption when it comes to having.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9068.73s">[Kit Collins]</a>: legal counsel available to the city available to the city council, even if in an inadequate way with the long term need to deliver on the priority to have more readily accessible legal counsel to the city council which I agree fully agree should be a priority and in general strongly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9086.04s">[Kit Collins]</a>: proponent of bringing more services in-house to the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9089.822s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I do plan on voting in favor of this paper tonight, but I do just want to say that I think that doesn't take away from the very strong need to reconsider where access to council lies for the city council going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9104.972s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't want to see a service interruption or a greater<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9112.055s">[Kit Collins]</a>: lack of access to legal counsel for anybody in the city administration or the city council through the remainder of this fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9119.579s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that would be, you know, harmful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9123.321s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I don't think that would be productive in the short term, but in the long term, I do agree that we need to, you know, support the city administration, support the mayor in figuring out how to get to a more sustainable situation in terms of the city council's access to legal counsel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9139.15s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10150.698s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10151.338s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And yeah, I just want to begin by thanking the Councilor Knight and Councilor Scarpelli for your comments on this so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10158.202s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And, you know, I'm very aware of my position as, you know, this paper coming before me and I haven't been behind the rail for the previous discussions on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10167.367s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I understand that your perspective on it is seasoned with more meetings than mine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10171.869s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I just want to be really respectful and observant of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10177.258s">[Kit Collins]</a>: you know, looking at this paper before us and hearing Chief of Staff Nazarian's comments on it, some of the analogies to me that come to mind, and especially having heard from some constituents, you know, even just before my first meeting about, you know, the impatience and eagerness to see a lot of these positions get filled, including positions that have been tabled in previous meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10198.944s">[Kit Collins]</a>: coming into the meeting with that perspective and I think with some of the plans that we do really urgently need to see and I know people are very impatiently waiting for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10208.326s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I know that in certain cases we need the people behind desks in order to make efficient progress on those plans and I feel that perhaps the finance director slash auditor is a great example of that perhaps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10222.33s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know I'm not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10224.55s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm not privy to the nuts and bolts of the reclassification study, to what extent the auditor would actually be involved in that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10230.591s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But it strikes me as the type of thing where we kind of have to make some steps forward to accelerate our steps forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10237.233s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So I'm, after some reflection, I'm planning on voting in favor of these papers tonight, because I think that that is our best, it seems to me that's our best way to make efficient progress forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10251.436s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that that is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10253.435s">[Kit Collins]</a>: know, certainly what we need to be clamoring for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10256.597s">[Kit Collins]</a>: At the same time, I fully respect the, you know, the sense of wanting for a plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10262.56s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I hope that having, you know, kind of reacting to the market forces that we're observing, and perhaps the difficulty of finding applicants for these positions could help us get to a place where we're getting that communication information that we desperately need and have been waiting for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10277.468s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7045.436s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7046.096s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, 11 Strathmore Road, number two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7048.898s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My name is Kit Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7049.818s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for the opportunity to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7051.939s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So really grateful that this resolution has been brought up tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7055.521s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you for creating the opportunity for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7057.915s">[Kit Collins]</a>: residents and Councilors to speak about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7061.677s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I just wanted to echo some of what's already been said before by Councilors and other community members and say that I really feel strongly that conversations are so important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7074.343s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that we need a really discreet programming and funding and concrete channels to continue conversations about race and racism in Medford and white privilege and white supremacy in Medford and how to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7087.183s">[Kit Collins]</a>: systemically unweave those realities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7091.086s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that also, you know, it's so important that we not allow these conversations to get derailed from the focus on addressing structural inequity as it exists in Medford, as it does, you know, in in almost every community across the nation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7106.418s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that we've had some really great outlines of things that we can do to begin to, to address those and to think in those directions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7113.663s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And some of that some of that thought is already underway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7116.785s">[Kit Collins]</a>: which, you know, is good, is encouraging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7120.027s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It might be overdue, but it's good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7122.668s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And, you know, I think that to say, you know, we've reached the end of our road here because, you know, the buck has stopped somewhere else, you know, just means that we're wasting time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7135.554s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that, like, we must be reflecting on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7141.4s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the spaces that we occupy, especially for people who already hold power in city government, for those who have plenty of spaces in the city where they already feel comfortable and feel comfortable talking about race, which certainly doesn't apply to everybody and doesn't affect people of every race equally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7157.205s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that we have to do the work of looking inward and saying, if there does seem to be a communication breakdown, if we feel like we're not hearing these stories, let's first look at the environment that we're perpetuating and creating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7168.588s">[Kit Collins]</a>: What can we be doing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7169.952s">[Kit Collins]</a>: so that we can be receiving this communication?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7173.154s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Is there things that we could do to make these spaces ones in which everybody can feel comfortable talking about these uncomfortable and sometimes outright dangerous topics?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7187.304s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that there's a role for the city council to have in being a really full-throated proponent of anti-racism measures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7194.729s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think lots of constituents would be really eager to see the city council take on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7200.171s">[Kit Collins]</a>: a more bullish approach to advocating for anti-racist dialogue, as well as, you know, as Councilors have said, policies that address structural inequities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7213.042s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So just to sum up, you know, I agree, we all have the responsibility to start these conversations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7218.687s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that, you know, we need to be creating spaces where people feel, everybody can feel comfortable<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7227.912s">[Kit Collins]</a>: talking about these issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7229.072s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And if we're observing the fact that we don't yet have perfect communication about these issues, I think that we also have to consider that the fact of white supremacy and racial divide is a reason for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7241.075s">[Kit Collins]</a>: So thank you for the opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=14324.958s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Hi there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=14325.939s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah, my name is Kit Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=14327.58s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I live at 42 William Street in South Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=14331.203s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you to everybody who's spoken so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=14332.685s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thank you to Councilor Bears for bringing this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=14335.387s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I too support the motion to hang a banner reading Black Lives Matter on City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=14341.432s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And just to echo some of the sentiments that have already been stated, but just to reinforce them with my voice, I believe that this is not a political statement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=14347.817s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is a statement in support of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=14349.79s">[Kit Collins]</a>: basic civil rights and the right of every person to enjoy freedom and safety in their community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=14355.935s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think that when we say Black Lives Matter, we're affirming in some way, you know, the same values that we affirm when we lobby the city council for safer streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=14364.681s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's an affirmation that we're not okay with the fact that for some people, because of the color of their skin, their life is more difficult, it's more precarious, more dangerous for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=14373.328s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's an affirmation that we are not okay with that being the case for anybody in the country or any of our neighbors here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=14379.978s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's an affirmation that we are a city where we want everybody to enjoy freedom, joy, safety, security.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=14387.484s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And to the point that, you know, I think that there are concerns about this message being controversial, it being provocative, it making certain residents feel uncomfortable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=14397.131s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, I would say to those people and to anybody who's hearing from their constituents those concerns, if you think that Black Lives Matter means that white lives don't matter or that they matter less,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=14408.118s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Then you can just read up on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=14409.379s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Just Google the movement for black lives and like read over the website because that's really not what it means.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=14415.082s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And anybody who takes that kind of issue from this language is simply misinformed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=14420.104s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's really simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=14421.085s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's about civil rights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=14423.046s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And this is the language of a movement for civil rights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=14425.667s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I want to live in a city where we're not afraid to voice our support for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=14430.049s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then I want us to back it up with real substantive action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=14433.511s">[Kit Collins]</a>: But like Nicole said, and a lot of people after her,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=14436.972s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We got to do the simple language thing first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=14440.394s">[Kit Collins]</a>: You know, we got to prove that we can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=14442.155s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's simple to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=14443.075s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We should do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=14444.196s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Let's do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=14444.616s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And then let's get on to the harder, more important stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=14447.337s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=14447.517s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thanks, Kit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=6060.023s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Can you hear me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=6060.503s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Yeah Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=6062.084s">[Kit Collins]</a>: My name is kip collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=6063.244s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I live at 42 william street in medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=6065.665s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I'm, just holding my mic kind of close because it's kind of bad um, I would just like to make a comment that I think that In this moment as the pandemic as much as we might hate to admit it is still very much ongoing It's going to be going on for a very long time, even though that's a reality that nobody is happy about I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=6086.336s">[Kit Collins]</a>: a really important part of the city council's leadership is to be a leader in how we are modeling behavior for how to act during a pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=6094.579s">[Kit Collins]</a>: I think it is, we're not even getting close to the time where we can begin going back to normal safely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=6099.081s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I think that the actions of the city council, not just in how<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=6103.463s">[Kit Collins]</a>: the budget meetings turn out, but in general the tone of what is acceptable, what is enthusiastically participated in, should be considered modeling for the whole Medford community as how we should be conducting ourselves safely during a pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=6116.971s">[Kit Collins]</a>: And I bring this up, I think it's most important because it's not just for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=6120.98s">[Kit Collins]</a>: The health of the people who will literally be in that room and their families I really think that it's important for us all to remember that this pandemic And infectious disease and health health in general is a racial justice issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=6133.686s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It is an economic justice issue We cannot forget just because the pandemic is wearing on It's becoming increasingly inconvenient.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=6141.069s">[Kit Collins]</a>: It's becoming increasingly tedious That um, you know, they're the most vulnerable members of our community are still being put at the most risk when more people go out<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=6150.733s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Become carriers without knowing it continue to spread this disease We are very far away along from having a vaccine and I think that even though it really stinks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=6160.356s">[Kit Collins]</a>: We all need to dial down Remain in the mindset of protecting our communities and I would really love to see the medford city council embody that spirit of protecting the most vulnerable as well through what they are willing to enthusiastically do<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=6175.78s">[Kit Collins]</a>: to support one another and protect each other from this disease.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=6178.523s">[Kit Collins]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>
