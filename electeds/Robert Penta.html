    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4059.531s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4062.853s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Having served on this board some years ago, the city of Medford and Tufts University engaged in the pilot, a million dollar pilot program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4070.599s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the pilot program consisted of six students from Medford, six students from Somerville, who'd be able to go to Tufts University for nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4078.644s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The million dollar cash part of the program consisted of three years of getting cash up front with the remaining portions of the money to be used for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4087.17s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think there could have been fire or police equipment here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4091.334s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now that hasn't been followed through since, for what reason, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4096.54s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the idea of taxing up to 25% relative to the nonprofit, whether it's Tufts University or someone else, I guess you haven't hit the dollar mark yet of where you're gonna go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4107.008s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But speaking with leaders up at the State House, the one thing that the City of Medford hasn't done, as other cities and towns done, you have not moved to provide an amendment to the CPA tax, which would include affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4120.793s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as a result of that, and knowing that the Commonwealth now does not give back to the City of Medford from their surplus to the CPA, it's all going to be on cities and towns, excuse me, individually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4134.938s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I think the city of mid that has an opening over and beyond your 25% also to amend the CPA to now include affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4144.467s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, you give it to churches, you've given it to schools into swimming pools and open space and land.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4150.333s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is a great opportunity right now for you as a council, first term especially, to move forward on your reps and on your senators to make this amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4159.44s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're not getting rid of the CPA, you're amending it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4162.442s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And by amending it to put this inclusion in there, this will be your first step along with your 25% for the purpose of going forward to get your affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4171.489s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The other part of affordable housing is very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4175.672s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What has the city of Medford, can you folks, any one of you here,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4180.322s">[Robert Penta]</a>: give an accounting of how much money has been used for affordable housing, where has the location's been, where is the land, and where has the working relationship taken place between a private contractor coming in with the city of Medford to provide affordable housing along with regular housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4200.675s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't think you have a big inventory on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4202.617s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think if you keep talking about affordable housing, you keep talking about the transfer tax, you keep talking about the registry, I think you should start there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4211.023s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because if there's nothing on the books right now, I think you need to get your feet wet in that particular area, get your base set up before you go into this next move.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4220.251s">[Robert Penta]</a>: 25% sounds good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4221.072s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think you need an inventory of all the property in the city method that's tax exempt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4225.035s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I'm quite sure you'll find<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4226.696s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There are other pieces only on Tufts University where you can get that 25% from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4231.419s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4275.327s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But a few years ago up in Beacon Hill, before the 25% came into play, there was a percentage ratio that went, like I believe Tufts University at the time had a $30 million endowment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4285.695s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And there was a dollar amount that was set on the endowment that the school had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4289.878s">[Robert Penta]</a>: as to what percentage it would go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4291.841s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, Tufts doesn't have a large endowment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4293.663s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not like Harvard University that's into the billions of dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4297.368s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But there was a dollar amount, you may want to check this out once again, do your homework, go to Beacon Hill and find out what that legislation was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4304.438s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Unfortunately, it didn't pass because as you said before,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4308.402s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Academy of colleges and universities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4310.565s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But still, it's a stepping stone to go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4313.369s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, and these are all pilot programs that you can look into, just because somebody is multi rich, like having I mean, Tufts University, you might find other locations where, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4326.28s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Listen, if you treat one one way, you got to treat them all the same way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4330.762s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it might be better to have a universal thing rather than go to the 25% and just go for the biggest one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4335.604s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because if you can work on all of them, maybe in the long run, you'll be able to get more in the long run than just grappling at the first one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4367.516s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But what you don't have right now in your inventory, you might have that, which I can vote, but you don't have the physical ground locations with new and additional affordable housing can go in and working toward that with getting this money, whether it's again, the 25% of the affordable housing of the CPA money, whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4386.75s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Understood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4387.171s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4387.811s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8558.968s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, can I speak on that first?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8561.349s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8585.106s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Did you withdraw it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8875.732s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. Chairman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9158.611s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert Pinto, Zero Summit Road in Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9162.154s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Regarding the public letter that was written on April 16th regarding House Bill, I believe it's 3128, the Affordable Home Act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9174.103s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In that particular bill,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9176.141s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There were transfers fees also that could be beneficial to a community that were discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9182.47s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And there was seven inclusions as it related what you could and could not do, which also had an opt-in and an opt-out proviso in that bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9192.364s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I'd like to, to you, Mr. Chairman, I want to get to your letter of April 28, where you sent out a notice saying, correcting the record on Medved's plans to address the housing crisis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9204.072s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And two particular paragraphs were sort of like, watch me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9207.054s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The first, the first one states the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9209.736s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The City Council and the City Planning staff are working on zoning rebuild reforms to allow more housing to be built, reduce permitting and regulatory burdens for private property owners, encouraging major economic development, and require construction of more<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9227.916s">[Robert Penta]</a>: subsidize affordable housing units.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9230.358s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We are also working on policies to benefit good landlords like the Good Landlord Tax Credit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9237.422s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the second paragraph reads, the final piece of that comprehensive approach<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9243.405s">[Robert Penta]</a>: is anti-disbursement policies targeted at the large corporations who are buying properties, jacking up rents, and earning a huge profit by knocking out long-time residents and making unnaturally affordable units too expensive for the average person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9262.242s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I understand what you wrote, but I don't understand who these large corporations that are coming in here into the city of Medford and they're dispersing people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9271.87s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I see houses that are bought by individuals who had an opportunity to buy a single family or two family house as an individual, but not as a corporation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9281.379s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you sent this out apparently because you wanted to allegedly, you know, correct something that was sent out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9289.502s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if I were to see this as I did see it, I'm confused right now because I don't know of any major large corporations that have come in to the city of Medford and bought single or two family homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9302.369s">[Robert Penta]</a>: either tore them down, rebuilt them, and sold them for large profit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9306.431s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I know individual people have done it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9308.653s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But when you say large corporations, it makes it look like this city is now being overrun by large corporations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9315.516s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you're going to address that through your zoning and your community development,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9322.278s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The wording is very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9324.6s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this type of wording makes it look like corporate America has just taken over the city of Medford, making it unaffordable for people to live here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9332.525s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9333.966s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You also have the opportunity of a business person or a business lady who may be able to come in here, can afford to buy a single or two or a three family house, do it over, and if they can make a profit, so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9345.773s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If the city really wants to get into affordable housing and low and moderate income housing,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9351.457s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They've had the last eight years to talk about this and do something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9355.978s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if they're not going to do it, then maybe it should be on the burden of the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9360.359s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And maybe you just you guys and girls, you just voted tonight on a CPA to give more money out, maybe to a place in the Brooks Estates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9368.881s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But put that aside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9370.241s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you're really concerned and really serious about affordable housing, you should start putting all your pennies together on all your nickels and all your dimes and all your resources where the money can come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9380.063s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and really have a second look.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9382.125s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, when the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, I think it's could be almost 12-13 years ago, came out with the CPA tax, we were supposed to, like other cities and towns, get a percentage of what the profit was on the state's annual profit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9395.754s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We haven't gotten anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9397.515s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you're really putting the burden right back on the Medford taxpayer, or the Medford city government to go forward and look for that type of development, look for that type of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9407.8s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, here's your chance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9409.361s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Before you get into the, you know, Worcester just got through passing, I don't know if you folks realize it, they just got through passing on April 29th, March 9th of this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9420.166s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The registry as it relates to single and two family and three family homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9424.79s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They had that, they voted on that in September of 2022.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9428.311s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it took them two years before they implemented it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9432.952s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They are now meeting in their next main meeting to make revisions to it because of the pushback, because there's a lot of stringent material into that registry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9442.274s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the best part about the whole thing, as the city manager said, he's willing to make changes and tone it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9448.396s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Can you imagine having, if you don't go and register, you're gonna get a $300 fine, and every single day you don't register, it's a $300 fine?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9455.837s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's kind of excessive, really excessive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9458.898s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, you don't wanna go to these extremes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9461.218s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what you do wanna, if you really believe in what you're talking about, you wanna have a full-blown discussions with the pros and the cons, and how this thing can or cannot work, and how does it fit into the city of Medford's lifestyle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9476.181s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. Chairman, with all due respect, I do not see large corporations coming into our city in Medford, street after street, buying and taking over real estate, turning it over and making a huge profit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9488.329s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If a single person, be it yourself or any member of the council, has the ability to do it, good luck to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9494.093s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what America is all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9496.074s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you're trying to reduce the rents, you're trying to reduce the cost of living, trying to reduce everything else, then speak to your state legislature, speak to your federal authorities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9505.72s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're the ones that should be looking out for you, just as well as your local authorities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9510.524s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3186.122s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, former member of this August body, and I'm really getting confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3192.83s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's been almost eight years since I've been back before this council, and I've been here three times since December.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3198.697s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I feel like there's something wrong with this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3201.241s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're going in a direction that doesn't speak about the Medford City Council taking care of Medford City issues, streets, sidewalks, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3216.053s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Also, my concern with this is, is the City of Medford City Council going to go into a public service agency?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3223.171s">[Robert Penta]</a>: by going into housing and being property reviewers, and you talk about a registry that a homeowner has to go and apply, well, I'm quite sure you're gonna charge them a fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3234.821s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's another money grab for the city of Medford, unfoundly, and it's wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3239.805s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And in the very last line of your document here, Councilor Lazzaro, I mean, excuse me, Councilor Callahan, I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3248.692s">[Robert Penta]</a>: you indicate that this is going to be good for our climate and our affordable housing goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3255.277s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, let me ask you something, as you folks going to manage this, you know, you have a program here that you want to create a review between now and when I don't see any name here as it relates to a real estate group of people that should be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3270.149s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because if anybody knows the whereabouts of the city, and the renters, it would be the real estate people because they're the ones that are renting out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3278.436s">[Robert Penta]</a>: not renting in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3279.937s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So what purpose would the city council have to try to tell a real estate agent or its company that this is who you have to rent to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3288.122s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These are the type of people and then what are we going to do stop making a registry of who you are renting to and be discriminatory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3295.467s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In fact, in the future, toward a certain class or an ethnic group of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3307.569s">[Robert Penta]</a>: city of Medford last year, and once again, this year put out in their documents, a it's called a notice of tenant rights and resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3317.097s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you look into the tenants rights and resources, it also makes reference to what the state law allows you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3324.022s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, if there's something wrong with a tenant or renter, they have many places to go, they can go to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3331.428s">[Robert Penta]</a>: MCAD in Boston, they can go to state real estate board, you can go to your right downstairs here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3337.496s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you can also go to the public health department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3340.44s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Right now they have five available ways for renter feels that they're being in frowned upon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3347.088s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But every good real estate broker knows whether it's in the city of Medford or any other place, that the fact of the matter is they're going to try to get the best person that they can, who can afford to pay the rent, and it's not going to be subject to a background check to their ethnic background.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3362.932s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because that unfortunately, is where this is going to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3365.992s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because once you get somebody in there, they're going to want to know where did you come from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3370.694s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let me see your references.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3372.134s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And where were you renting last?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3373.694s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's not what this council's job is all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3376.816s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What an answer!<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3386.119s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Pardon me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3387.7s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't know you haven't gotten there yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3389.822s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You just you just have you just I'm not gonna I'm not gonna sit here and say that we're going to hear you have discrimination as the chair as the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3408.457s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I didn't say you were you said you're going to put a registry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3412.961s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, what's the registry going to include?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3415.523s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Ask the maker of the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3416.924s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You cannot come here with resolutions and not be able to answer the questions for what you're looking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3422.288s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then you don't belong here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3423.609s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Go someplace else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3424.83s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3439.144s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm just frustrated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3440.825s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And probably taking it out on all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3443.207s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I am taking it out on you for a particular purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3445.769s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm going to repeat myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3446.929s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I have a bad habit of repeating myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3448.931s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Please just do what you were elected to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3452.613s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, you guys went out there and campaigned and rang on the doorbells and asked people to vote for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3457.256s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Did you tell him you wanted to put a registry for housing in there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3460.659s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3461.019s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3471.963s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let me just conclude by saying the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3476.204s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, you know something, just relax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3478.345s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You had a little do to do with their Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3481.025s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You took my time up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3482.726s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm gonna ask Mrs. Callahan, I'm gonna ask Mrs. Callahan to withdraw the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3488.72s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and think this thing through, if you really think it's worth something, come back at another day with definitive answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3495.565s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you don't have an audience that's screaming and yelling that they don't want it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3499.187s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maybe there is something that can work its way out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3501.789s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maybe if you work with the real estate brokers in this city, it can make some kind of sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3506.052s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the two person homeowner doesn't have to pay a fee to get himself registered or her registered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3511.495s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And at the same time, there's going to be none of this background check<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3515.478s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that revolves itself around where I am, who I am, what my ethnic background is, what my financial status might be- Thank you, Mr. Penta, your time is up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3523.161s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, wait a minute, wait a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3524.782s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Wait a minute, I'm not through yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3542.164s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You took time away from me to talk to Councilor Scott.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11581.727s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert Penta zero summit road former member of the August body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11585.268s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Number one local government is what it's all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11587.409s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So we're not talking about state government here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11589.47s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're not talking about federal government and I don't really care what was on that shot about other cities and towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11594.673s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're talking about our city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11597.894s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And for 12 consecutive years, his name was Council President Bob Miyako, it was emphasized every single night during those 12 years of city council meetings, that this was the people's forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11610.26s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is the only place that they could go for redress, whether they went to a department, the mayor, what have you, they were dissatisfied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11617.643s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And there were nights we stayed here till 12 and one o'clock in the morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11621.645s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that didn't bother me because that's what the job was all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11626.294s">[Robert Penta]</a>: First and second of all, if you have a meeting as you've had over the past, since December now coming forward, when you have lines of people waiting to speak, let them speak first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11636.781s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The people at home, they're sitting in their chairs, they're sitting in their comfort zone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11641.044s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have people here that need to go to work the next day, have paid for a babysitter, or just came down here because it's finally got to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11647.569s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Something is really interested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11649.49s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Two of your free people that are sponsoring this,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11653.294s">[Robert Penta]</a>: have never done anything here in the city of Medford that should even qualify them to make a result of going to two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11660.322s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then you go from two minutes to three, just like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11663.305s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, that's the way it was the consideration for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11665.688s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why don't you just keep it at five minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11668.351s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In 2022, you went from 10 to five and everything seemed to work out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11671.835s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the only reason why these meetings are getting to be as long as they are, unfortunately, because you're every other week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11677.518s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So maybe you should go back to being every week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11680.259s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that way the the agendas won't be as long and they won't be as contentious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11684.401s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But to worry about the length of time that you would have to sit here, you get $30,000 a year to supposedly represent the people of this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11694.403s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And don't you dare think you're gonna come back here and ask for a pay raise because you have to stay late at night and you do committee meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11701.966s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's crazy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11702.646s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If anything, it would be wise for you to make a decrease in your salary because of the conditions that the city of Medford is in right now to show and put your good fest forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11710.808s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But that'll never happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11712.509s">[Robert Penta]</a>: just like a pay raise will probably come forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11715.17s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, the sad part about this whole thing is, again, you're spending time on what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11720.893s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Just tell me what is so bad to sit here and listen to someone for five minutes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11726.476s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What is so bad that you have to go and look at another community and see what they do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11730.778s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're talking about Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11732.678s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you spent your time doing your homework, when you're out there campaigning, you would realize you're talking about Medford, not Arlington, Cambridge, Somerville, Malden, or Everett, or Chelsea,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11743.944s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let me ask any one of you when you're out campaigning, and you rang the doorbells for your votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11749.106s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Did you spend more than two minutes and say, I've got to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11751.827s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I only give them two minutes to speak to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11753.988s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Of course not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11755.549s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That would be the height of insulting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11757.85s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you want to insult people coming up here who pay your salary with our tax dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11765.353s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's a shame, that is wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11768.054s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And not to single anyone out of you, I'm gonna blame all of you, because if all of you vote for the craziness of this, and I call this a stupid resolution, because it makes no sense in the interest of good government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11781.457s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can talk about Harvard all you want, you can have your special days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11785.458s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And just as an information to Councilor Tseng, you indicated this month is Ramadan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11789.7s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, do you know what today is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11791.803s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Do you know what today is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11792.584s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Today is National Autism Day, sponsored by the United Nations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11796.127s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't see that on the calendar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11797.909s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That to me is as important as your Ramadan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11800.491s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you people want to talk about all these national issues and put them on the calendar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11804.996s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What does that do to help the city of Medford, the people of Medford, to pay the taxes on a daily basis that go to work here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11812.683s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I strongly suggest the three members who put this forward, cancel it, take it off the ballot, and leave it alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11819.807s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And let the good people of our city have their five minutes at the podium, have their say, whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11826.25s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And hopefully, if you go back to maybe every week, the amount of resolutions that you put on there won't be as contentious, and it won't be so controversial, you won't have to stay here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11836.655s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But even if you do have to stay here, eat it, because that's your job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11841.357s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what you signed up for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11842.938s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You wanted to be a council to represent the people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11845.699s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if I heard you correctly, Mr. President, you said you've spoken to people to disagree with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11850.261s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So to some people from an hour, two hours, whatever it might be, and you didn't accomplish anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11855.803s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You spent two hours of your time on a conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11858.684s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you want to cut us down to two minutes of this podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11861.545s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That makes absolutely no sense at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11863.167s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's absolutely contradictory to the whole premise of what this resolution is all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11867.414s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Again, I respectfully ask the three members who put this forward to cancel it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11871.76s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And also, there's a book, it's called The Naked Socialist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11874.924s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Anyone have ever heard of it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11876.852s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a very interesting book, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11878.994s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a naked socialist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11880.735s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Pardon me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11883.558s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, it's not about you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11884.478s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm gonna just read with you at the very conclusion of what it says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11887.841s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This goes back to 1968.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11890.423s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A lady by the name of Ezra Taft Benson, she was the former secretary of agriculture under President Dwight Eisenhower, gave a speech outlining the following- Mr. Penta, you're five minutes in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11900.952s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Regarding public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11902.654s">[Robert Penta]</a>: One line, and it says the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11905.376s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Government may not possess more rights than those held by the individual, and government may not simply assume them as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11914.223s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When it does, you're operating toward tyranny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11916.826s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11917.646s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let me just finish, please, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11920.308s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11921.229s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would can I just finish please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11923.17s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11924.271s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Can I just finish please sentence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11926.993s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11927.913s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would just hope that this council does not find itself being involved in the naked terrorists and any kind of socialistic communistic movement by stopping the people from speaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11940.701s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15396.441s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why do I only have two when I should have five?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15400.763s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, you're tired, you want to go home, is this all about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15408.465s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Show me the rule on the council, because rule 16 says five minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15413.227s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what it says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15422.131s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Can I finish what I'm saying?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15423.132s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have two minutes, we accept two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15424.112s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, you shouldn't be speaking from the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15425.753s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have no right to make an opinion from the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15429.574s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have no right from the chair to make an opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15432.316s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15434.797s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're against Robert's rules of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15438.338s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'd like to ask the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15442.0s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'd like to ask the vice president question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15444.801s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We may I know I can't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15448.002s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On the motion of this meeting, I am not the chair of this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15451.343s">[Robert Penta]</a>: City Council meeting bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12434.747s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12437.229s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm a former member of this August body, and back then it was an August body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12441.453s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I'd like to make a suggestion before we even start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12444.817s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's many people in this room, and there's a long line behind me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12448.08s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The people at home can wait.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12449.341s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're in their own house, sitting in their own chairs, under their own roof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12453.326s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would appreciate it if you do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12458.206s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12458.806s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Number two, let's get into the whole issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12461.348s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You own a house, you pay taxes year in and year out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12464.709s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You get your water and sewer tax bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12466.59s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then you have an addendum that was picked on the water and sewer tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12469.331s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then you have the CPA tax, which is an end run on proposition two and a half.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12474.014s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And now you're coming in here tonight and you're talking about possibly a transfer of tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12479.016s">[Robert Penta]</a>: With all due respect, Councilor, you said it's been three weeks since it came up until now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12483.777s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But what happened in the last three weeks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12485.758s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You folks voted to have these meetings every other week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12488.518s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And now it's three weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12489.519s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So what happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12490.439s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12493.24s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Pardon me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12495.3s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Just because there was an election, there's four other days in the week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12498.421s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Come on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12500.179s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, let's be honest about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12502.861s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where is the proposal from the administration that wants what you people want to propose here tonight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12508.504s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you really want to be heroes about what you think this tax should be, you should vote tonight to end it, receive it and place it on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12517.209s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12521.178s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Number two, if you really think it's that important, you should maybe in a couple of months call for a public hearing on a non election on a non Tuesday night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12531.727s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that way they you can listen to the people as to what you're proposing, because what you're proposing right now, it's quite obvious, either the message got out wrong, the information isn't being heard correctly, and you people are going to send it to a committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12545.078s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what's it going to do in the committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12546.579s">[Robert Penta]</a>: either you're for it or against it, because if you have it on the agenda to discuss, how much more do you need to discuss it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12551.941s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're either for it or you're against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12553.961s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's why it's on the agenda, period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12556.882s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now therefore, if you don't want to vote on it, and you want to refer it to a committee, well then kill it tonight, and then have a public forum if you want, and have the entire community come whenever they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12567.085s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have real estate folks out here, the real estate folks out here buy and sell homes, they're buying and selling of homes and the taxes that are paid into this community represent almost 82% of the city's budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12579.116s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They more than anybody understand what the real estate tax does for the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12584.699s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And for you now want to put a transfer tax on there for no godly reason why I don't know, you could talk about all the affordable housing you want, but you have no plan in front of you, you have no locations, multiply, you have no reason and no dollar amount ready.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12599.807s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But what about the proposal next to the old GE place that was supposed to be affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12604.112s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What about where Bertucci's is with the science, public science building was going to go, what about a mystic Avenue 500 mystic Avenue where there's going to be a proposal for 500 units in commercial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12615.875s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've got locations here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12617.077s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You talked about your first time in 30 years, you're doing a rezoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12619.939s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, where's the rezoning?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12621.121s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where is the rezoning here tonight that you can present to the people of this community where affordable housing is going to go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12626.506s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12627.387s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You haven't brought in the real estate people so they could see so they could work with you as a council so they could understand what your needs might be so they would have an idea of what they can buy and what they can sell for the people that they have to deal with on a daily basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12640.814s">[Robert Penta]</a>: have to understand something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12642.796s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These people are upset out here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12644.417s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're upset only because of the way it's come up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12647.62s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Don't forget, you had the meeting canceled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12649.582s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And now it's here in their mind, they're thinking it's a 2% tax, it's going to go out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12654.247s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So why don't we just forget the tax?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12657.11s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why don't you just forget this resolution?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12659.272s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you guys and girls really think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12661.954s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's worthy of having a conversation to call for public hearing and see what the input is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12667.856s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Rather than saying it's going to be 2%, 1%, it's going to be at a million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12672.138s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The lady that was on there, she hit it right on the head.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12674.378s">[Robert Penta]</a>: She bought a house for $44,000, then she paid 68,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12677.88s">[Robert Penta]</a>: She was the American dream.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12680.841s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And why should she be penalized in her senior years of her senior American dream that she would have that money that she would have to give back that's not going to her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12697.025s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, we're talking about a democracy each and every day with this political election that's coming up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12702.252s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Right now, what you folks are talking about, socialism.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12705.556s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You think you should be sharing your people's products.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12716.934s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's wrong to get in this mode.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12720.599s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I don't really think this council really wants to travel down this road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12725.146s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if you really want to be genuine about this issue, rather than refer to committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=12730.854s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would strongly suggest that one of you, if not many of you, make a motion to receive it in place and on file tonight, and then call for a public hearing, two or three weeks, when the entire city of Metro would have an opportunity to come and speak, not like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9763.941s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass, former member of this August body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9770.385s">[Robert Penta]</a>: First of all, let me start by saying, what does this pay raise have to do with education?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9777.142s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9777.902s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Number two, there's no demanding from the public for any pay raise for the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9783.785s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And lastly, there's no professional city population job description pay report that even substantiates or supports what the council has alluded to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9794.829s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The gender issue that was alleged this past December is nothing more than a sexual red herring allegation of discrimination that has no merit to the issue before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9806.494s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The job is what the job is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9807.995s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The responsibility is what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9809.456s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It doesn't say it has to be male or female.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9813.66s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's the red herring to the whole thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9815.541s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if this proposal were to pass, should we now compare all our municipal positions with the same amount of financial equity and equality as compared to each position, especially with those having different responsibilities?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9829.052s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Fire, police, school teachers, they all have different job duties and responsibilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9834.841s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if we're looking at something that's now saying the school committee should have equity pay to that of a city councilor, well, you're setting a standard here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9842.388s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this standard should be compared to, right now, what is presently found in your municipal contracts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9849.275s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Additionally, if this proposal is to pass a comprehensive review,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9854.56s">[Robert Penta]</a>: should be undertaking to set a years of service pay scale to be compatible with all of the municipal employee negotiations, comparing newly elected newcomers to both the city council and the school committee at the beginning of the pay scale formula.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9869.046s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Therefore, for the new members in the council, as compared to the new members on the school committee, why should either one of you reap the benefit of the maximum pay<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9878.63s">[Robert Penta]</a>: when in fact all other municipal employees start at a base pay and they go through a process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9885.112s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if you're looking at this equity for both and all sides, then let the council and the school committee also be put in the same type of position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9896.533s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay, as such by granting the city council additional type of raise without having increasing any educational value, without having any community support for it, and without any professional city population job description report only demonstrates the power of behind the scenes internal politics, where the power of the dollar personally overpowers the needs of our public school educational needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9924.972s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have surrounding communities, and I took the six surrounding communities that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9928.674s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Arlington, they get paid $3,000 a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9931.275s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Everett, they get paid $11,500.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9933.036s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Malden, they get paid $7,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9934.917s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Somerville, they get paid $16,600.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9936.218s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And Methodist, they get paid $12,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9938.639s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Methodist is the second highest paid school committee of the surrounding areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9944.468s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You serve in these jobs for the quality of giving good education to the community, not for how much money or you should be paid equal to that or in excess of our total to the amount of what a city councilor makes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9959.321s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Last December, the pay concerns for paraprofessionals, classroom assistants, custodians, substitute teachers, et cetera, were discussed, but they've yet to be addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9969.509s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This hall was full with almost 200 teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9972.938s">[Robert Penta]</a>: At the city council, the school committee pay raise increase without any proposal to differentiate the differences between the city council and school committee responsibilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9982.09s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As the gentleman just stated, showing the need such raise or pay equality has yet to be proven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9989.397s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Therefore, at last meeting on December 12, these were the issues that were of concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9995.261s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A, needing additional instructional hours for students, AP classes, class size needs, athletic programming, student activities, school library resources, counseling services, school security, custodial school maintenance, after school programming, and something that's gonna creep up on you fellas, it's unprepared for migrant student educational<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10019.219s">[Robert Penta]</a>: studies and support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10021.381s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, these are all dollar amounts that need to be addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10024.923s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you are going to take on the proposal that's before us over the next two years, approximately $76,000, you're taking that $76,000 away from your school department educational budget that could be used somehow to get into some of these programs, if not all of them, to some degree and a percentage of whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10045.762s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The pay scale for those caring for these programs was at issue, and yet as of today, nothing has been done to resolve any of the issues as presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10055.033s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The City Council School Committee pay raise proposal does not recognize and connect to the short and long term needs of our public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10063.664s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So when and if you folks are sitting here and you're discussing these needs, and you think that the school committee should be making more money, and you have a school committee that's been around for so many years, allegedly for 20, if that's what the issue is, well then let's, what do we need to motivate and show that their need and they're worthy of it other than<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10082.987s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, they should be making the same as in Worcester.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10086.568s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They have an audience that does say up to 50% of what a city council makes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10090.19s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But their job responsibilities may be entirely different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10092.851s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Do you realize right now, a kindergarten assistant, if we were to follow this pay raise as proposed, a kindergarten assistant who works five days a week and is subject to everything in that classroom as every other teacher, will be making $1,000 less<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10110.336s">[Robert Penta]</a>: then this pay proposal for a school committee person, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10113.937s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Makes no sense at all because a school committee person doesn't have to sign in, doesn't have to check in, has no responsibility as it relates to, you know, what am I doing on a daily basis that says I'm doing something that's educationally correct for this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10128.763s">[Robert Penta]</a>: By granting from the city council, let's put it this way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10134.906s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There should be some justification before you folks<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10138.43s">[Robert Penta]</a>: from, and it can't be from the at present school committee because there'd be a conflict of interest because they have a financial gain from it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10144.793s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So it's gotta be as according to the state law, the chapter is gonna come from your folks in the state council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10149.836s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But what has this school committee done, especially with its new members that has said Medford's education is better, Medford's discipline is better, and that's seriously questioned as to what's going on up at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10163.439s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The sports programs is getting better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10165.76s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Parents are getting more involved, but also at the same time, where is the educational standard in comparison to other cities and towns throughout the Commonwealth of Massachusetts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10176.283s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Has the school committee made such great strides that, hey, they're working together with the teachers and their organizations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10184.365s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When you had here last week, and I know you have some new folks that are here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10188.787s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On December 12th, there was almost 150, 175 teachers that were here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10193.2s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And they explain to you the plight of not only being in the classroom, being attacked, where their pay is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10200.203s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Some of them have to work five years, five years before they even make $25,000 a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10206.905s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's unconscionable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10208.666s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Justin, I understand that you want to give them a pay raise, you know, but I didn't hear your logic behind it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10215.929s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, he's the one, it's his resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10222.679s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay, through the chair, Justin, I know you wanna give them this Bay Race, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10227.441s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you haven't said anything, none of you have expressed any comment as it relates to, they deserve it for the value of what they do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10235.224s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Can anybody explain to me,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10237.765s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you really want to give somebody a pay raise, isn't the job description and your job duties and your employer supposed to do the review of you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10246.208s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, of course they can say, the Medford taxpayer is your reviewer and you run for office and they elect you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10252.25s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay, that's all well and good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10254.251s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the Medford taxpayer doesn't pay your salary, it's the Medford City Council according to state law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10259.997s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the Medford City Council, by right, can make a great demand on this school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10264.499s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you really want to improve it, we'll look at this in two years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10267.68s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let's see what this new school committee does over the next two years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10270.801s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let's just see through your intervention with the Medford Teachers Association and from the superintendent all the way down, that everything that's taking place in all our schools, from kindergarten all the way up to the high school, has gotten better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10282.004s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Grades have gotten better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10283.925s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Discipline has gotten better and under control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10288.174s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That would make a big difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10289.575s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And maybe people might say, hey, okay, you're working toward it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10293.216s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But when you have a job that you don't have to sign in, check in and give any report as to what you do and why you're doing how you do it, and expect to start off at a higher rate than people who have been here for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10305.782s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's just not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10307.643s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the last thing, let me just say this as it relates to that, and I told you Arlington gets $3,000, Everett gets $11,500, Malden gets $7,000, Somerville gets $16,500, and Method gets $12,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10318.977s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're the second highest one of the surrounding communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10323.723s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A kindergarten<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10325.609s">[Robert Penta]</a>: through the chair to Justin, a kindergarten teacher assistant after the second year gets $21,568.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10332.391s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's $1,000 less than what you wanna propose to a school committee person who doesn't go to this job every day, like the kindergarten teacher goes to school every day, five days a week, and does everything that education says of that person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10350.556s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maybe you should have a sit down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10352.912s">[Robert Penta]</a>: with the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10354.713s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because they can't tell you that they want it because it would be a financial benefit to them, that would be a conflict of interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10361.578s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But somebody needs to understand, just because they need to get paid more, because they're not getting paid enough now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10368.383s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, they're getting paid $12,000, and if they don't want it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10371.545s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And through the chair to Mrs. Callahan, not for anything, you made the comment that you think that, you know, to get good candidates, you need to pay more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10379.63s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm gonna respectfully disagree with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10381.992s">[Robert Penta]</a>: a good candidate is someone who wants to run for the job because they believe that better things can be done and I can do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10388.195s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if I can't do it, then the people won't reelect me that salary has got nothing to do with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10394.017s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the salary should not be used for your own personal gain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10397.779s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm going to make $30,000 a year now more 24,000, whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10401.861s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the sad part about the whole thing in conclusion,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10404.815s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If this proposal were to go through, you're taking $74,000 a year out of this Medford School Department education budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10413.077s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's bad enough now for them to work on a daily basis without having enough of the money that should be in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10419.558s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now you're gonna take another $74,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10421.339s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you know, where does that go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10424.379s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How do you explain that to the Medford taxpayer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10426.86s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can't explain it to me because I wouldn't buy it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10429.921s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because right now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10431.596s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The Medford School Committee is working with all they can do just to maintain their budget and to get by and to start taking more money away to give it to an elected official who does absolutely nothing to enhance or embellish or make better school education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10450.595s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's, it just doesn't make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10453.296s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if I understand you correctly, I believe you said you would like to have this go and have a decision come up by the end of December of this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10460.479s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe that's what you said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10462.259s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That would be okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10463.4s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But to vote on this tonight, I think it would be wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10466.721s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it would serve no purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10468.622s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I don't think it would be good for Medford public school education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10472.483s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's my opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10473.544s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10506.561s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Can I ask a question to the chair?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10507.901s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10508.482s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Did I misunderstand Mrs. Cowell?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10510.283s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Did you say in part of your questioning there is, I think you- She listed a variety of different reforms, rank choice- All right, it was one of the things that you said you wanted illegal aliens to vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10520.887s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Did you say that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10537.305s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Oh, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10541.468s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm more than happy to answer any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11251.067s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yeah, just a point of information, just as a notice for this council, I think it was three, maybe five to six years ago, there was a report that came back from the Department of Revenue, Mass Department of Revenue that said, the old school thought was in the council budget, you could only decrease, but that's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11266.959s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can now make appropriations that go the other way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11270.722s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I think it's just something I think you really need to take into consideration as it relates to something that you might see in the budget,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11277.438s">[Robert Penta]</a>: where the old school was that you only could reduce if you wanted to save money, so there would be no way that you could transfer that money to another section, but that's not true because now you can look at certain sections within your budget as it relates to appropriating for or making something less.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11294.267s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think that would be very key, so let's stick to your, Councilor Collins' comment as it relates to this could be a beginning step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11304.192s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If it's going to be a beginning step,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11306.753s">[Robert Penta]</a>: it should be a step that parallels every single municipal employee from step one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11311.897s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Some school teachers, I believe, have 10 steps before they get to the top, but an elected official has no steps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11319.082s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's never been that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11319.802s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if you're going to put everybody into the same genre, so to speak, well then maybe<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11325.786s">[Robert Penta]</a>: An elected person can maybe have five or six steps, whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11328.849s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Don't forget, one of the real benefits of an elected official is if you serve for 10 years or more, you get a pension.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11336.236s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You get a pension from here, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11338.999s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There are some cities and towns that don't offer pensions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11342.478s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So besides the salary, you're also getting the benefit of a pension with a minimum of 10 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11349.283s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I think that really needs to be taken into consideration when you're talking about pay scales and pay raises and whether it be for the council or the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11357.682s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And one of the things that seemed to be a juggernaut in the school and the municipal side is just that particular issue, whether it's in the fire or the police department when they're in their pension areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11368.813s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So it's really something that serves you folks with a good benefit, school department issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11376.064s">[Robert Penta]</a>: school committee person, same thing as a city councilor, but you really, you just don't want to throw that aside without realizing that you're getting a benefit that a lot of cities and towns do not offer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11389.536s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So just thought I'd let you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4111.271s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I have a two-page statement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4113.992s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., a former member of this August party on the City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4120.255s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 71, Section 52, does grant to the City Council, by a majority vote and by the city charter, the responsibility of how much members of the school committee get paid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4132.02s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But historically, the city council has paid more than the city school committee because the council's responsibilities exceed those of the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4139.885s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The city council responsibilities include, but are not limited to enacting ordinances, zoning, fire and police, public safety requirements, setting the city's tax rate, and has the final authority over the city and school department budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4153.895s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As examples of major differences between one challenging equal pay for equal work between the city council and the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4162.38s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Further, just as in any business, job responsibilities and pay are what one is applying for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4168.324s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Under this proposal, it is a gender attack being disguised as pay parity, for equal pay for equal work, for which it is not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4176.008s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The proposed school department 100% plus pay increase will be paid from the Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4181.952s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let's take a look at what that means.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4184.233s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Annually, we are barely able to meet the resources we have now at our school's disposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4190.282s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If we cut further any of our school resources by not funding them, and instead giving them 100% plus salary increase for school committee members, we should be concerned as to where we are heading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4201.477s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If we are to cut some $90,000, because that's what it'll come to, plus each year from going forward from the school department budget, the results can possibly affect the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4211.306s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Fewer instructional hours for students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4213.748s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Elimination of AP classes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4215.89s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Increased class sizes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4217.531s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Elimination of some athletic programming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4219.853s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Elimination of support for some school activities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4222.736s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Elimination of school librarians.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4226.486s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think the rules say five minutes if you check the council rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4229.429s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Reductions in council services, school security being at risk, reduced custodial cleaning and maintenance, after school programming, migrant student education support, and unbeing prepared for migrant student educational support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4244.904s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I meant the public schools short and long range term should not be subject to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4249.387s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if the school committee pay increase does go through, what do you say about the salary for the everyday school paraprofessionals?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4257.051s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As example, every class assistant under five years would finally earn $30,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4261.593s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And everyday kindergarten teachers after five years would only earn $25,980.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4268.462s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This after five years, while the school committee would receive $29,000 annually for a part time job with no everyday reporting requirements and responsibilities is at best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4280.952s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If the city council is to accept this ridiculous proposal, maybe the council should then set a pay scale standard for both the city council and the school committee for years of service as compared to pay scales a standard for just every other municipal employee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4296.577s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Using the presently proposed gender issue of females being more in number who are elected to serve is not only discriminatory, but a sexist allegation that has no merit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4309.824s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what about a person who claims to be other?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4313.525s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what about when trends tend to go back to when men become more elected than women?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4319.048s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Being elected is a gender neutral opportunity, not to be disguised as pay parity for equal pay for equal work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4326.555s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As I said in the beginning, job responsibilities and pay are the guidelines for which one is applying for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4333.001s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As of this meeting, there has been no input from community members on the Medford School Committee regarding this 100 plus salary increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4343.69s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As a thought, and this flows right into what you said Councilor Scarpelli, if the council is so inclined to accept this measure of allowing this red herring issue of more females than males being elected officials, then maybe in the spirit of physical conservatism and the council being magnanimous, the council should entertain<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4363.806s">[Robert Penta]</a>: being paid the same $12,000, as we said before, annual salary that the school committee is currently paid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4370.447s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Therefore, on the city side, if the city can save $90,000 annually from their city council salary, which can be used for municipal needs, the school department, one sentence, the school department will not lose the $90,000 annually that can go to public school education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4391.072s">[Robert Penta]</a>: One sentence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4395.627s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I wanna close by saying my following sentence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4398.168s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. Penta, Mr. Penta.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4400.108s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4401.609s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why, hey, wait a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4408.691s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let me ask you a serious question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4411.432s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I served on this board for 36 years, and we stayed here sometimes till 12 and one o'clock in the morning to let everybody speak, not to be shut off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4428.009s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I want to make my last sentence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4429.171s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Do you mind?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4430.414s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, I might.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4431.075s">[Robert Penta]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4432.355s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I shall close by saying, why did the city council president put this controversial proposal on the agenda now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4442.0s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Was it because of the busy Christmas season and it being at the end of the year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4446.463s">[Robert Penta]</a>: With the hopes that nobody would observe it and find out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4448.944s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But they did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4449.825s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But they did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=7976.461s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Good question, Robert Pencil, Zero Summit Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=7979.242s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's quite obvious from the comments that have been made here today, whether you're a paraprofessional or you're a full-time employee, you just haven't been treated the correct way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=7988.026s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think it's incumbent, I believe it's incumbent upon one city councilor who will have the guts and take this resolution and say, receive it and place it on file and kill the issue now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8498.316s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of this August party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8503.72s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'd like to read a line in the mayor's message today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8509.285s">[Robert Penta]</a>: She wrote, even if we all agree that these additional expenditures on city services are helpful, we need to understand the sacrifices we're asking taxpayers to make and the other pressures they are under.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8524.016s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Sacrifices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8525.858s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Madam Chairperson, you're the perfect example for this, what I wanna say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8530.961s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You recently got married, and when you got married, you- No, I got married six years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8536.285s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay, when you came to Medford, you moved to Medford a few years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8541.848s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Almost 10, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8542.649s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, I don't have an exact number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8548.132s">[Robert Penta]</a>: of what you've got going through right now is the fact that you just have a nice brand new baby, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8552.373s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you're a brand new mother.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8553.934s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's very important for what I wanna say, because there's a cost factor that goes along with all of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8560.436s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a mental factor and it's a financial factor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8563.236s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I'm quite sure you realize what it costs now having a young child, what that entails on a daily basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8569.538s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When we hear the fact right now that there are additional pressures that are gonna be placed on individuals,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8576.297s">[Robert Penta]</a>: whether it's a single family, because that's the only one we heard, it was a single family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8580.258s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We didn't hear about the two family, the three family, the condos, or the apartment dwellers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8585.38s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We didn't hear that, that information hasn't been brought forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8588.201s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it should have been brought forward if you're going to be thorough in this presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8592.203s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And when you wanna talk about spending, or controlled spending, you need to talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8598.925s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So as Councilor Knight has alluded to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8602.203s">[Robert Penta]</a>: not thinking this be the right way to go, and I agree with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8605.704s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've never really had, as Councilor Marks alluded to, an outside independent order on every single department that would justify this council going into an administrative decision with the city administration to discuss, we need to now go into a Proposition 2 1⁄2 override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8624.591s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You folks are sitting here tonight with not one city administration here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8629.409s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know if they were asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8631.192s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know if it was intentional for them not to be asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8634.777s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But it would have made a big difference in trying to understand why we are at this stage at 12 and a half.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8642.928s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Two and a half weeks ago, you folks voted at a budget meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8646.855s">[Robert Penta]</a>: At the beginning of the meeting, you voted seven to nothing not to approve the budget, but after the mayor came in and a quarter or two in the morning, you voted seven to nothing for the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8655.263s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So what was asked for and what was gotten all took place between seven o'clock and quarter to in the morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8661.93s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, is that an exact budget science?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8663.972s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't think so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8665.69s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is that the right way to go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8667.331s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have a proposition here tonight being proposed to $12 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8670.874s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where is the statistical information?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8673.576s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where are the reports?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8675.438s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where are the reports from the school department?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8677.539s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Not one school committee person is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8679.701s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Not one school administration person is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8682.063s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The superintendent should be here if she thought she was gonna be so lucky to get almost $6 million out of a $12 million proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8689.369s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then we go on the city side,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8691.31s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8692.23s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have seven unions in this community, but there only seems to be two that have been recognized here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8697.052s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And very conveniently, they don't mention the Veterans Affairs Office, the veterans in this community who paid who paid through their lives for us to be here and give our commentary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8712.157s">[Robert Penta]</a>: To be exact, you need reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8714.658s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the only way you can have a good report is to make sure that you require it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8720.66s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8722.843s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think I heard Councilor, I don't know where he disappeared to it's his resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8727.148s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, Councilor Bears I believe said you know we've been asking for the last seven months and this and that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8733.355s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the mayor hasn't come around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8735.017s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well you know something, who has the greatest power in this city to control the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8740.987s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's the Medford City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8743.069s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what you also can do at any one given time, whatever that mayor, he or she wants, this council can vote against it until you guys and girls get what you want and what you ask for, because that's the way the game is played.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8757.18s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'll help you if you help me, but if you're not gonna help me and you just go along and you vote for it, well, you're just as much<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8764.805s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Just as much to blame think about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8767.046s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've allowed these budgets to go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8769.466s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you know they knew this was going on, and you did nothing about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8773.787s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you started in January asking for these financial reports and you didn't get them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8778.669s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then you should have stopped anything that came from the mayor's office, looking for approval until you got your reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8784.47s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Your responsibility and for the city is to run its financial management, and when you have intermittent and you don't have administrators in this building that can come forward to explain what 12 and a half million dollars will do more than $550 on a single family home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8801.693s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You got the doubles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8802.713s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What about the commercial piece of people property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8805.394s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You haven't even discussed them, and in the following years they keep going after two and a half automatically goes up each and every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8811.975s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's something to really think about, because this is not chump change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8815.776s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This isn't $1, $2, or $3 million that you probably could find if you went through that budget and you cut through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8822.258s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is $12 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8824.439s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And who come up with the $12 million?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8826.9s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Two Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8828.74s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Two Councilors who don't even pay real estate tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8831.441s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They don't understand the value.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8853.836s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm gonna continue what I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8855.277s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you understood, if you paid real estate tax, you would understand the impact that this would.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8904.473s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, you maybe missed my point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8906.634s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My point was this, not owning the real estate and having to pay those additional taxes, that gets itself disseminated down to you as a renter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8914.936s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if you, as a renter, are gonna pay the difference in the increase, but you're putting the burden back onto the who.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8920.578s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if she has a tax, if she's paying a rental tax,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8924.019s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that she can afford right now, maybe about a two or $300 a month increase, she won't be able to and that's what we're talking about people on fixed incomes, seniors on fixed income.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8934.005s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And when you hear the story, when you're watching on television, every dollar counts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8938.127s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is it going to be for my medicine?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8939.708s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is it going to be for my where I'm living?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8941.949s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is it going to be to put gas in my car?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8943.71s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is it going to be for food?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8945.091s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is it going to be that I can't go out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8946.532s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I got to stay home?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8948.153s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what we're dealing with right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8949.435s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're dealing with an economic impact in this country that's affecting everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8953.32s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that $12 million will kill this city of Medford because the city of Medford will never recover from something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8960.65s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you vote for that, you're going to...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8963.333s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you vote for that $12 million, you're going to take away what Medford is all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8968.536s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Councilor Knight was absolutely right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8970.777s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Sit down, have a discussion, go over the whole thing, and ask for an independent outside audit to address all these departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8978.942s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what you need to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8983.224s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, we're too good of a city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8984.965s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We are way too good of a city to let something like this happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8989.552s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We've sat here for years with former Councilors and myself, and we never, never experienced anything that was presented in the middle of the night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9000.559s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what July is, it's the heat of the night, it's hot out, it's almost 90 degrees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9006.413s">[Robert Penta]</a>: where the people that this hall should be full of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9009.617s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's not because as Councilman alluded to, there was an issue way back a couple of two or three years ago in Mystic Avenue in the month of August when they had a public hearing and all the people showed up and they got so scared as to what's going on, they canceled the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9022.412s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And after they canceled the meeting, they took the vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9024.835s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No way should this happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9026.757s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let me just leave you with this last thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9029.499s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Your own Rule 19 on the Medford City Council states that the Medford City Council shall not approve of any bond or expenditure that does not have a written explanation of such expenditure at least seven days prior to said vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9044.229s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You got this three to four days prior to today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9047.652s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's not seven days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9049.353s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You cannot even vote on this tonight because your own rules say it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9053.676s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And your own rules also state<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9057.012s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The following any financial paper appearing on the council agenda for the first time, shall be automatically laid on the table for one week when such action is requested by any one member, I'm quite sure there was at least one number here willing to put that on the table unless they have another motion to go by, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9075.965s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I didn't mean to get to an argument with you and I wasn't trying to be right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9078.546s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I was just trying to compliment you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9079.607s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I got my day years mixed up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9081.528s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The fact of the matter is I look at individuals today and I say to myself, how do they afford seven $800,000 houses?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9090.712s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How do they afford when they have two cars and they have kids running all over?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9093.833s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maybe you must be maxed out to the answer degree in debt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9098.447s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We never did that growing up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9099.848s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We worked for everything we got and we went along as we went.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9103.452s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is huge, $12 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9106.315s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This isn't $1 million or even two that maybe you can figure out how to massage your budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9112.521s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It doesn't work that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9114.86s">[Robert Penta]</a>: to be good Councilors, dismiss this action right now, move yourself into a committee to meet with department heads, hire an outside independent auditor to come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9126.406s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you could spend, as Councilor Knight said, $300,000 for an outside law firm that should be doing exactly what this law firm and the city of Medford is paying for, there is something wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9139.013s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5456.479s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Panto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5457.54s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I live at Zero Summit Road, a former member of this August body for 36 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5462.958s">[Robert Penta]</a>: For the past 82 years in the city of Medford, you folks have had weekly council meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5469.04s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I've served under both a plan A and a plan E form of government, and they held steadfast, not only to their weekly meetings, they held steadfast that this microphone, this podium right here was the people's voice on a weekly basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5485.506s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We've gone through the years, situations,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5489.849s">[Robert Penta]</a>: in the Wellington area, whereas if you were on every other week situation, the rat problem that took effect a few years ago, would have never got itself involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5500.758s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then Councilor Caraviello, Councilor Knight can remember people coming from the Morrison Ave Park area regarding in the wintertime storms that took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5509.846s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if the people had to wait every other week to come down here, their problems would have been exacerbated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5516.12s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You talked about making decisions as you relate of committee meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5520.842s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If committee meetings are a result of what takes place here at a city council meeting and forwarded to a committee, and the committee does whatever it's work has to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5530.386s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It still has to come back before the council, but it initiated itself right here in the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5535.848s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Tonight was a perfect example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5538.069s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When the gentleman from the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5540.555s">[Robert Penta]</a>: front porch came down here and unfortunately all the papers weren't in order until the clerk went downstairs to get the papers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5548.878s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, if the papers were not there, he would have had to wait two weeks if this process of two weeks took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5554.72s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That would have been a financial burdensome on that individual through no fault of his own because his papers were filed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5561.002s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And when the chairperson got the papers and he saw they weren't filed and they were signed off properly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5566.744s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When all of you folks ran for office like myself, I knew it was on a Tuesday night and I also knew that no matter what the day and the week was, was immaterial to the job and my responsibility to do the job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5581.018s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, if you folks wanna go to every other week with 18 committees that you have set up, and of those 18 committees, if you decide you wanna have three or four of them or five of them on every other week, and some of you are on the same committees, how is that gonna work during the same time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5597.304s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's just impossible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5599.645s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Right now, you can meet anywhere, as Councilor Scarpelli alluded to, you can go Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and you're meeting every week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5606.773s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This podium is here for one particular reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5609.875s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is the safeguard that a taxpaying citizen has to come here without having to wait, geez, I gotta wait two weeks because the pressing need is happening right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5620.923s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You folks are getting paid $30,000 a year to do this job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5625.807s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you know what the time commitment was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5627.789s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you also know what the dollar amount was to the salary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5631.444s">[Robert Penta]</a>: God forbid, if you ever go to every other week, you want to come in here and ask for a pay raise, you really will be adding insult to injury.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5638.588s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because that's just something that will never pass the muster of why you folks got elected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5644.332s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You got elected to do one thing, to represent the people the best way you could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5649.755s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And right now for 82 years it's been every Tuesday night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5653.336s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now Councilor Caraviello says change is good, but all change at all times is not good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5660.197s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The lack of community input to every other meeting, the lack of a community input as it relates to why are we making this change?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5667.979s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have two brand new city councils that just came on this term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5671.92s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm quite sure when they were running for office, this was not an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5675.861s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And since it wasn't an issue then, why is it an issue now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5680.222s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Second of all, when you go into the meetings, you talk about the regular meetings of the city council shall be held every two weeks on Tuesday evening at 7pm, beginning the first Tuesday in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5694.507s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then in the last sentence, it turns around and says the following bit further resolve that these updates become effective on September 1 2022.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5704.742s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So what is it, September 1st or is it January 1st of 2023?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5708.263s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's a mix of words there, something is wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5714.364s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Also you talk about here, an emergency meeting shall take place unless immediately undelayed action is deemed to be imperative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5725.687s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, just think about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5727.267s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Does any one of you know right now what an immediate action could be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5731.588s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What an emergency could be in somebody's life?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5734.705s">[Robert Penta]</a>: or some business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5737.867s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Pardon me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5739.928s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Does anybody know what an emergency could be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5742.229s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't, and neither one of us know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5750.274s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm talking about the community interest for this to make this change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5774.743s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You presented on the agenda for this evening, the word meetings, and this is a result of the change that took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5780.207s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So is it January 1st or is it September 1st?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5783.13s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What's it going to be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5785.431s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if it's September 1st, then it does not become operative January 1st, but that's not the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5835.017s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, it doesn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5835.557s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It says in the bottom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5836.797s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yeah, September 1st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5841.978s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't think this is no devil coming from the sky.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5852.298s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5854.1s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The fact of the matter is simply this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5856.141s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The reason why we're here on a Tuesday night is whether, like last week, you folks only met for maybe 30, 35 minutes, and you've had a pretty easy go from January till now, but once the budget comes in and things start to pick up, okay, so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5868.012s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But imagine if you had it every other week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5870.474s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And once the budget takes place and you start to get into every other week, and you're here four, five, six hours, and then you're going to put a time limit on because you're incapable of probably making an intelligent decision because it's kind of like late night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5884.042s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why do you want to disturb something that has worked?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5887.664s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And more importantly, if you felt such a need for this, and if this council was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5894.488s">[Robert Penta]</a>: so engrossed in the fact that we had to change this, then why don't you just make it effective beginning September of the next election?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5901.572s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why would you do it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5902.352s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It wasn't even an election issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5903.993s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So how did this become an issue right now, less than six months into the term?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5928.783s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I understand that, but it's been while it's been, it's not like it didn't come out of the, it came out of the blue, but while it's been discussed, it never got passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5940.889s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the question is to the metric citizenry who are watching this, they're going to have to figure out, they only can come here every other week, but at the same time, at the same time, you have 18 committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5950.154s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So are we going to say between the first week and the beginning of the second week, these 18 committees are going to work and your committee, the holes are going to work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5958.512s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, is that going to make any kind of sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5961.055s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's 18 committees and there's only seven of you, and many of you are on the same committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5965.861s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, so how do you, how do you go through this, this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5991.247s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know what I mean, it's the only place for a public forum, you've got your opinion, I have a forum on what it's a public forum for someone to come and speak on whatever the issue might be, it might be a neighborhood issue that doesn't find itself on the agenda, it might be an emergency that doesn't find itself on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6016.653s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have your opinion, I have mine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6018.534s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As far as that goes, Madam President, I said what I had to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6021.816s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I just feel, like I said, it's been 82 years, it's operated under plan E, plan A. It's been every Tuesday night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6029.38s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You never really know what the situation might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6031.482s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And when you got elected, you knew.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6033.283s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You knew when you got elected, the meetings were going to be every Tuesday night and subcommittees were whenever they're going to take you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6039.066s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And why should time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6041.047s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why should time even be an issue?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6043.089s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Whether you meet one night a week or whether you meet four times a week, that's what you got elected for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6047.732s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And whatever the issues are, they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6053.556s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, being elected never bothered me to go to a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6059.175s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if it was every week, I went every week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6061.976s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If it was two or three times a week, we would meet two or three times a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6065.657s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And let me just conclude by saying the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6068.078s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If in fact, this council feels that they now want to change to every other week, please do not put anything on the agenda that asks for pay raise, because you would really be insulting the people of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6087.545s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, that's not what I said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6089.486s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What I said is if you're going to make this vote to go to every other week, please don't come back and vote in support of a pay raise for yourself, because then $30,000 for every other week becomes overpaid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6102.47s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as Councilor Caraviello alluded to, when he made his comments two weeks ago, if you go to every other week, maybe you should reduce your salary from 30 to 15,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6109.813s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6975.109s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm Robert Pentezero, Summit Road, Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6977.41s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe a couple of weeks ago, this council passed two resolutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6980.693s">[Robert Penta]</a>: One was a million dollars for new sidewalks, and I believe the second one was for $250,000 to remove tree stumps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6987.497s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But there was no identification of where the sidewalks were going to go over and beyond money for new panels, and there was no identification as to what tree stumps were going to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6997.404s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, over the past few years, here in Medford, former public works director had one,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7003.688s">[Robert Penta]</a>: two types of lists, one for tree stumps, and one for sidewalks, but unfortunately when the council passed at this time nobody asked that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7011.173s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So as a citizen, the council did ask, they asked a question of where they're going to be located, the tree stumps, and the sidewalk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7018.778s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So is there any way that that could be made a public disclosure, either on this, we don't have any city newspaper anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7025.623s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So method patch, or in the city web page could that go on there as soon as we get it, we can put it in, we have a dry folder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7033.088s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Madam President, you say as soon as you get I understand that but you should have had it the night that you took the vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7051.887s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But, but is there a list right now that it is available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7063.536s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So then just a very simple question, not to beg the issue, but maybe it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7067.498s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, you get something to vote on, especially tree stumps, much more than sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7073.803s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Those locations should have identified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7075.484s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is the third time something like this has been presented to the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7079.207s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So did you get the first two lists?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7083.51s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, have any of these lists<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7086.187s">[Robert Penta]</a>: tree stumps from the first of the second list even been taken care of some of them with duplicates especially on sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7091.488s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's just a thought because some residents are saying a million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7094.149s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's a lot of money for sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7128.295s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is it possible, Madam President, you can just secure a list for both?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7139.461s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7139.741s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7140.301s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4053.299s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5144.967s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Pantazzo, Summit Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5147.468s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what subject would you be speaking on, sir?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5149.329s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'd speak on the Ambulatory Surgical Center up at the location of the Lawrence Memorial Hospital at 170 Governor's Avenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5159.495s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The reason why I'm bringing this up was after reviewing your city budget and recognizing that you folks set a tax rate this past week, unless I missed it all together, there was no inclusion at all as it related to the amount of money that the new ambulatory service center would be bringing to the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5180.813s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe this past, last past Tuesday,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5184.056s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On the 14th of December you folks sat in committee and discuss the tax rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5189.979s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I believe, and I could be wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5191.64s">[Robert Penta]</a>: One of the questions that was asked by one of your colleagues Council marked to the assessor as it relates to have you arrived at any kind of a decision regarding the tax rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5201.606s">[Robert Penta]</a>: at that location 170 Governors Avenue and the assessor responded that they had filed for a tax exempt status.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5210.613s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Conferring upon that and having a brief discussion once again and reaffirming this conversation with Councilor Falco who once again had the same type of concern as related to the assessor's issue of how and what they're going to be taxed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5225.924s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think she said that it's charitable or something of that nature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5230.193s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So putting that together, and I just went back and just did a little bit of history on this because I was involved in many of the issues on this particular matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5239.915s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On August 28th of 2018, I sent a certified letter to the State Department of Public Health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5245.717s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And one of the components of the letter, it was issued, I issued the regard regarding tax exam status, which up until that point in time had not been mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5255.539s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On September 17th of 2018, in the method transcript,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5259.94s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And headline title future of the lots of oil hostile include community input on this say, but in paragraph number 10.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5266.688s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I like the existing building, it says the ASC will be a for profit and will therefore pay property taxes to the city of method that came right from them themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5277.841s">[Robert Penta]</a>: October 30 2018 and the city council meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5281.803s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was discussed again as to whether the proposed ASC being a builder and the hospital footprint would pay taxes, would it be by the square footage of the whole Lawrence and will hospital footprint itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5295.564s">[Robert Penta]</a>: November 19 2018 at the council meeting, there was a need for an update for clarification for our city of sex office as to how the SC will be determined for tax purposes if approved by the State Department of Public Health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5311.068s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Will it be for the whole Lawrence Memorial Campus to be considered as a for profit, or would it be broken down by the square footage of each building separately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5320.417s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Again, on November 27 of 2019 Susan Sandberg, then CEO and Vice President of Melrose Wakefield Hospital,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5330.106s">[Robert Penta]</a>: appeared before the city council saying for the first time that the AFC will be a for profit business here in the city of method.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5337.372s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Again in November 2018 I sprinted into the method transcript.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5341.776s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The discussion was once again, a for profit business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5345.699s">[Robert Penta]</a>: December 6 2018, the method transcript said in the proposed commentary period regarding method officials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5355.177s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then in paragraph 13, quote, the proposed method surgery LLC, a joint venture between then named Melrose Wakefield and the Shields Healthcare as being a for-profit taxable ASC.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5368.365s">[Robert Penta]</a>: February 19th, 2019 at a city council meeting, issues were presented as it related to the construction and to the taxing status.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5378.49s">[Robert Penta]</a>: March 19th, 2019,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5381.432s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Melrose Wakefield then notifies the city council and the city that the separate footprint that was going to be at 170 Governors Avenue would now be merged into the property of the Lawrence Memorial Hospital.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5393.519s">[Robert Penta]</a>: April 23 2019 the city council meeting, Sue Sandberg said that she was so pleased with the development that have been taking place regarding this proposal taxes will be determined by the city assessor regarding this tax matter, and Michael Max F at the city will be doing a pilot program on the $733,000<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5415.035s">[Robert Penta]</a>: community health initiative that community health initiative was a planned a planned program for health services within this community and surrounding communities over two to a five year period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5427.778s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I have not heard one comment by this city, this city administration, or the city assessor's office, as it relates to what is the plan program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5436.78s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if in fact it became a pilot program, it was possibly discussed at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5442.021s">[Robert Penta]</a>: May 7 2019 at a committee of the whole meeting once again Council mass ask who, who is going to be paying the taxes on their separate office space, or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5454.591s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The mayor at that time, who was the city council, indicated that she was concerned of a pilot program as it related to just what and how, if we're not going to be getting taxes, if we're going to be involved in a pilot program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5472.001s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Councilman Fred De La Russa also made comment as he was concerned over how the tax issue was going to take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5478.966s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On May 28th, 2019, city council once again<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5483.088s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Vice President Susan Sandberg said the ASC will provide new tax revenue and will provide an additional $750,000 within a two to five year period for additional area services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5494.854s">[Robert Penta]</a>: She reiterated on May 18, that for which was said on April of that year of the Community Health Service $750,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5503.578s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On June 4, a letter was sent to Susan Sandberg by myself once again, talking about issues as it relates to the taxing issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5511.242s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then on October 15, 2019, Susan Sandberg reiterated that the ASA will bring tax revenue to the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5521.588s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Also, then-Councilor and then-Mayor Brenna Lundgren stated that she wanted the developer to provide for the city of Medford<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5532.12s">[Robert Penta]</a>: a tax, a tax review number one and number two, the vote will take you can say that the vote that the council is taking that the, the, the agreement would go to the petitioner, not to the land.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5550.164s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When they made their proposal before this method city council into the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5556.145s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Their information presentation read as follows in one of their sections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5561.147s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What benefits will an ASC bring to the city of Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5564.828s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Their response was the ASC will pay local taxes, as well as add jobs in the area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5572.411s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In addition, as part of the state revenue process, there will be a substantial community benefits contribution, that's the $750,000 I was talking about, to help address the pressing health and social welfare needs of Medford and other communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5588.037s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The total amount the ASC will contribute towards community health initiatives is approximately $733,000, and that'll be paid over a two to five year period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5600.053s">[Robert Penta]</a>: From that period of time, from May 7 of 2015, that can be the whole meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5605.894s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I believe you had at that point in time made reference to Councilor Falco as it relates to that particular meeting, as it relates to how taxes were going to be paid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5615.776s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This city council has not been advised, never mind the council, the taxpayers have not been advised as just how and when it's going to take place for taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5625.17s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And how are they going to pay it and when are they going to play it, and what meetings if anything has taken place at that meeting in May of 2019.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5632.497s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I also presented before there before the city assessor communities such as Weymouth, and then the central hospital and what they were doing with their cities and towns in combination of either a and in lieu of taxes or a tax payment to be made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5649.833s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have received nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5651.66s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Nothing has come back, Mr. President, as it relates to this particular issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5656.533s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I secured from the Secretary of State and the State Attorney General's Office, there was no filing of any sorts, other than the amendment that they filed in 12-4-2020, which was December 4th, of a change of address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5672.643s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They had the original address in Boston, and now they changed it to 170.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5677.426s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, just because they're built at 170, 170 Governors Avenue, same address as the Lowell Memorial Hospital, where urgent care is there right now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5686.112s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There should be no taking advantage of that being a tax exempt nonprofit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5691.033s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When she was came in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5693.254s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They made it perfectly clear that the linchpin to this deal was that they would pay taxes to the city method on the ASC 16,000 square foot piece of building that they were building for $17,500,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5708.327s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a shame that during this budgetary process, when you were setting and addressing your tax rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5715.429s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Nothing was presented as it relates to the anticipation of approximately any wisdom, five and a half million plus dollars on an annual assessment of that piece of property, what that would bring in for taxes here to the city of medicine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5731.452s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But before this council gets going again in January next year that this issue is brought to your attention we've heard all kinds of rumors oh yeah they're going to pay, whatever it might have been, you have nothing from the assessor's office in this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5744.688s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's saying number one, they're going to pay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5747.371s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't have anything regarding the community health portion of $755,000, that's going to be paid over to a five year period of time for the health initiatives and concerns that you might have to be brought forward, and that was brought to the state's Department of Public Health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5763.216s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When this was all presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5764.277s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is a real concern that I have I'm very concerned over this because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5768.638s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's hundreds and thousands of dollars that potentially could belong to the city of method coffers that could be used, whether it's in our public health department, our schools our budgets police fire, whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5778.964s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is too small of a thought to be issue when in fact it's a big issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5784.547s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And to me it's such a big issue that it hasn't been discussed, I say shame on everyone who knows what that should have been done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5792.832s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This should not be a red herring coming up now to say okay why are we talking about we're talking about now because nobody in the city has talked about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5800.439s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if somebody made a mistake in their commentary that that's it's for profit will then so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5806.183s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If it's a for profit, not enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5809.126s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If it is for a for profit business, excuse me, you people should have this information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5815.411s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We the taxpayers should have that information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5818.577s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5819.258s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is anyone behind this real received anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5836.495s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So let me ask you this, Mr. President, directly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5838.617s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You had a conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5839.618s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Do you have anything in writing from them that says that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5841.159s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you want something in writing, I will get something in writing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5843.221s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think the council deserves it, and I think your tax base and your tax rate deserves it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5847.884s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I will have something in writing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5849.546s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would strongly suggest that a council resolution go forward seeking that, and that nailing it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5854.65s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And for further information, Sue Sandberg is no longer with Melrose-Wakefield.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11114.927s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11116.728s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I didn't realize you're gonna allow folks from the audience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11120.75s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're here with someone from 1892.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11125.012s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Great service, Mr. Delato, 1892.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11126.632s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He looks the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11128.953s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know what the pill is that he's taking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11130.574s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's probably not the blue pill, but that's neither here or there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11134.783s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When I look at these two gentlemen here, I don't know John Falco as well as I do Michael Marx, but I will tell you this, going back to when John Falco was first running for school committee, I met with him and my wife at a restaurant at Mystic Avenue, and he was gracious enough to listen to her concerns being a school teacher as to what possibly could be things that he could bring forward to the school department for which he did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11158.714s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I appreciate that and I commend them for taking the opportunity for run for higher office this past year, because it takes an awful lot for someone to give up something that you might have as a security position, which would be a council school committee seat to take the next step forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11173.631s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if you don't try and never know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11174.993s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As far as Michael Max goes all I can say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11180.386s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I wish he was here a little bit longer because I think he probably would have given me the one last incentive to once again run for this August party only for one reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11190.934s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This city is going through a tremendous, like the country, a tremendous amount of change and you do need some level-headed people to understand yesterday, to capitalize what's going to take place for today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11203.203s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I just hope and wish that this new incoming council can put together<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11209.553s">[Robert Penta]</a>: with the fellows that are here for a few years, some wisdom and common sense that recognizes that we are the city of method, and as an as inclusive as we are, we should not be divisive at the same time, because it cannot work and you cannot sustain itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11226.359s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I thank you, Michael for your years of service your dedication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11229.722s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But more importantly, I thank your family for allowing you to do it like my family allowed me to do mine for 36 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11236.747s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I appreciate it and I know your folks and your families appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11241.009s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I just hope that the incoming city council grasps the knowledge that needs to be taken to make this city work to go forward and to be able to question<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11251.796s">[Robert Penta]</a>: without having to be called divisive rather than not divisive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11257.6s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Asking a question to get an answer is the best way to resolve an issue rather than not listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11264.184s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because I think it was you, John Scott that says, you listen and you listen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11268.126s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the more you listen, the more you can learn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11271.028s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Merry Christmas, happy, healthy new year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11273.51s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And congratulations, John and Michael.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11276.027s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2928.951s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2930.907s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Pinter, Zero Summit Road, mentioned NASS, former member of this August board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2935.029s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let me just tell you something right up front.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2937.91s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I spent 36 years behind this rail, and I never once denied anyone the ability or the action to come before the board and say whatever they thought was important to them, because this is their house, not your house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2953.036s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2956.065s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Number two, Council Mark is only asking them to denounce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2959.509s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That sends the message citywide, anyone who might be watching, reporting or what have you, that we're not going to tolerate this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2968.859s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It makes absolutely no sense at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2972.102s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And let's get to the real major thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2974.863s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. Vice President, you talk about how many more times are you going to do it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2978.745s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, this all started when the mayor of this community sent a message down to this council to say that the city of Medford was systematically racist, and you folks voted for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2990.43s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you've already been in, you're already in this, you're already in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3001.537s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, I mean, what's kind of an idiotic remark is that we're talking about how this thing, how this thing all generated itself, you know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3011.182s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if Mr. Beers wants to have a debate any day of the week on this particular issue, I am quite sure, I'm quite sure he can be accommodated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3022.367s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He's a Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3023.348s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He's an elected official of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3025.27s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's who he is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3026.111s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's what his responsibility is, not just to move on and let's get to the next subject matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3032.497s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Listen to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3033.478s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're talking about human beings out here who for the past year have gone through a life and altering<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3041.595s">[Robert Penta]</a>: whether it's their business, whether it's their family, whether it's their kids, or what have you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3046.398s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The city has never been subjected to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3048.819s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the cowards, and that's what they are, the cowards who are behind that racist amendment, let them come forward, take their position, and stand their ground like a man or a woman, rather than go in the cubby hole, and I'm gonna just keep throwing these bombs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3066.263s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Councilor Marks, you hit it right in the head.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3069.045s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The whole idea of what this thing here tonight was, people have gotten frustrated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3074.188s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No matter what the outcome is with the investigation, which is now criminal, that in and of itself ought to tell you something's going on, and I hope our police department, and I hope our police department does find it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3087.816s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, everybody tonight has kept mentioning, you know, the mayor's comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3091.098s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The mayor's comments were written on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3096.024s">[Robert Penta]</a>: July 17th regarding the July 15th rally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3099.347s">[Robert Penta]</a>: She wrote them on July 17.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3101.369s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what she said on that, and that's the reason why they're here, and they're rightfully to be here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3106.153s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They talk about that the attendees used language that was disgusting, abhorrent, and it has no place here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3113.556s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, can somebody please come up here and tell me what was said by any one of the 30 people now recognized?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3120.922s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because they stood there in behalf of, they stood there, they didn't even speak, they stood there in behalf of our Metro Police Department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3128.968s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The people are right there every day defending us and taking care of the needs of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3135.544s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why would you want to turn a blind eye to that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3138.125s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's ridiculous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3139.965s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Fire department, school department, teachers, first responders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3145.407s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This Medford City Council has an obligation, whether they like it or whether you don't like it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3151.545s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is wrong what's going on in this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3153.848s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you allow this to continue going on each and every day, and you allow these anonymous cowardly people to do what they're doing, we won't have a city anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3162.597s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because the divisiveness will cause physical anxiety between people, and no one will ever get along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3168.223s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you'll never see the right time of day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3170.165s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The city of Medford will no longer exist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3172.728s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's what we don't want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3173.908s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What you do want is inclusiveness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3175.929s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You want people to be able to sit and to talk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3178.429s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have a difference of opinion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3179.809s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay, you discuss it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3181.53s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you don't go and sneak around like in the middle of the night like a thief and you put something out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3187.811s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Social media is public media.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3190.171s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not private.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3191.671s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's so public it gives you an opportunity to respond, whether you're on Facebook, Instagram, or whatever you want to call it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3198.653s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3200.073s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would respectfully request and hopefully that every member of this council takes its position, lets the entire city of Medford know what their positions are, because let me tell you something, this is an immediate election coming up, and it's gonna reflect badly on anyone who decides that they're afraid to take a position, because they're gonna wait for the decision from the criminal court to come back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3221.629s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let me tell you something, if it was any one of you folks, and it was your name that was on there,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3226.553s">[Robert Penta]</a>: you'd see you'd be acting a little bit different because you wouldn't want it to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3230.555s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It started in this building, it started over there, it came over here, and this council voted for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3236.137s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And when you voted for it, you accepted the responsibility that went with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3240.679s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why should any citizen who had nothing to do with anything<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3245.841s">[Robert Penta]</a>: be held accountable for something they have no control over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3248.902s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I just don't know where to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3251.983s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I am so upset with this right now, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3254.024s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I cannot believe that this Medford City Council is toying with this as to whether to vote for it or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3260.127s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's as obvious and as clear as can be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3262.768s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Do your job, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3264.088s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=463.132s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Good evening, my name is Bob Penta, Zero Summit Road, former member of the Sarkis party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=467.496s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would respectfully disagree with using the word concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=470.279s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The fact of the matter is that an accident has already taken place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=472.921s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Tank has already been going down that road and coming up that road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=476.184s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have MBTA buses telling you, you have a line from your own traffic consultant that tells you that a fire truck, if has to, can go on the opposite lane.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=486.073s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have no idea at what time of day or night that that might be happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=489.436s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The whole idea, I believe, the impetus of the council president's resolution is to let this city administration know that this council is not supportive of this type of islands coming in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=503.304s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can call it part of the complete streets program, the $563,000 that the city got from the commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=509.888s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where was the fire chief being consulted on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=512.33s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where was the city engineer being consulted?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=514.251s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And all these proposed bump outs that are being planned right now, continuing down on High Street, going into the West Medford area, where's the consultation for that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=523.599s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Just go look at Sagamore Avenue and see the way they want to have that cutout coming out into the middle of High Street and then Boston Avenue over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=531.064s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then further down, right opposite the Brooks School, there's a gentleman who just did his driveway over and he's got a bump out in front of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=536.308s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It doesn't make any sense at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=538.49s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would not change one word in the president's resolution, only for one reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=542.311s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The city administration has to know that you do recognize that this is a safety problem here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=548.192s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This isn't just for cars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=549.753s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is for trucks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=550.873s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is for ambulances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=552.273s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is for other kinds of vehicles that are heavy duty going down there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=556.334s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And we're not talking about a good day, as the council just alluded to on Sunday at 9 o'clock in the morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=561.795s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The gentleman, unfortunately, didn't see the island.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=564.376s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Not only didn't see the island, he wrecked the whole bottom of the carriage of his car.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=568.738s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What are you going to do in a snowstorm when it's dark out late at night and you have a big heavy tanker going down there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=575.046s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What are you going to do with a bicycle, a gentleman or a lady driving their bike down there, going in that little lane there, and you have an emergency vehicle trying to get by?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=585.42s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, one thing I learned after many years of being on this council is one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=590.962s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you know you see something that's wrong, why would you want to just smooth it over, use the word of concern as relates to telling the city administration, you're going to continue on with this complete streets program, this traffic calming issue, then the public safety is the priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=608.887s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And right now it's quite obvious that it's not a priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=611.547s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Correct me if I'm wrong, Council President,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=613.828s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Fire Chief said, even though he can get by, he's only got a foot on either side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=617.818s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is that what he said?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=653.904s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would believe that the impetus of the resolution, if you want to get to the concern that Mr. Isaac Beers has introduced, that would be something that they would once again look at to come back, okay, we'll redesign it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=667.652s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you'd lose your impact by putting the city on notice that you've recognized, you've talked, this is four times in a month, you have discussed this issue and it's not going away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=679.152s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the only way it's going to go away is if the city administration is aware of it and whoever their contact is with the state for the purposes of trying to make this correction, so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=688.674s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As of this Sunday, the fire chief, as of this Sunday, the fire chief still hasn't been informed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=693.175s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So he had to go out there and do his dry run.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=695.555s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, how do you call that progress?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=697.916s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How do you call that when somebody is supposed to sit down and let's talk about this traffic calming issue?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=703.837s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How can it be traffic calming when you haven't even spoken to the public safety personnel who it's going to affect?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=710.559s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, it isn't like you guys, young lady, are in a tough bind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=716.882s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a very simple resolution that the President has offered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=723.225s">[Robert Penta]</a>: as the mayor of this community and to your departments, we're putting you on notice because God forbid something happens and somebody gets killed, this council has put the city on notice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=733.328s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If not, God forbid something happens and you modify that resolution, you're all gonna be part of a lawsuit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=740.93s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then you're gonna have to explain your way out of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=743.651s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's wrong and that shouldn't happen like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=747.454s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would suggest, Mr. President, that you do not accept the resolution to modify it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=752.939s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Just make it as a concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=754.02s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not a concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=755.001s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=755.842s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a public safety issue that demands its attention one way or the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=760.987s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if they don't want to resolve it, shame on them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=763.129s">[Robert Penta]</a>: At least the council's on record explaining the reason why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=766.172s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=768.034s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=770.837s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1163.281s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Just in response to Council max.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1165.983s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Nobody's asking anything to be redesigned I don't think any of us have that expertise we're aware of that, but nobody came into the city and sat down with the public safety people, as it relates to all these locations that are being promulgated, and whether a review after four months<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1182.35s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, after four weeks talking about this and there's still, there is still no communication with the public safety personnel of this city, which means either one or two things, either the city administration is not listening to the council, the city engineers not listening to the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1197.512s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you have a fire chief who's basically telling you, you might have a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1201.414s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have a city traffic engineer turns around and tells you, well, if something happens, you can go to the opposite side of the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1207.537s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, that in and of itself tells you right there, don't talk about public safety when you have a fire truck coming at you on the opposite side of the street, if an emergency exists, or if there's a snowstorm or whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1219.06s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The whole idea I believe of the impotence of this whole resolution is to put the city on notice that you're not happy with the island there because it is, it has the potential to cause problems and if it's going to cause problems in an accident for which you've already had one it's already started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1233.951s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, keep us out of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1235.793s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We should not be part of any lawsuit by any citizen, city of Medford or other city of Medford, because we told you this was going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1243.402s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maybe it might be wise, Mr. President, to invite the state in to sit down with the city council and review every one of these locations that they want to put in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1252.032s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How many accidents have taken place?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1253.833s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is the reason why we're putting it here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1255.774s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where the bump boats are going and what's the reason for it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1258.695s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They made the determination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1260.236s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They don't live in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1262.016s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're not the experts for the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1265.118s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's our city engineer and our public safety because if it's going to impede anything that they do on a daily basis, they should be primary before any decision is made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1275.623s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5772.241s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, former member of the circus party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5778.526s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'd like to read a three-page prepared commentary<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5783.65s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that I find and feel to be very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5787.011s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a message from Memorial Day to Flag Day, and it's a commentary to our Medford residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5793.653s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Memorial Day, why is my speakers off?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5799.655s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Memorial Day was never intended as a celebration to remind us of the ugliness and the ravages of war, but rather to honor in some solemn observance, our men and women,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5812.54s">[Robert Penta]</a>: their survivors, and our allied comrades who sacrificed their lives to protect our liberty and our freedoms here at home and around the world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5823.785s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Likewise, our Flag Day observance on June 14th is but an annual reminder of some 244 years ago when the Second Continental Congress, along with George Washington, took a break from their writing of the Articles of Confederation to establish a standard bearer<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5842.382s">[Robert Penta]</a>: to be the unifying symbol of our colonial fighting forces and for our freedom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5850.245s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As our fledgling nation was moving forward in its quest for its independence, that is how Old Glory was commissioned to be our American flag.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5861.143s">[Robert Penta]</a>: From Memorial Day remembrances of lives given up to protect our America, to the flag day birth of old glory, both symbolizing the embodiment of our right of free speech, we are here today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5876.69s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But in the interim of many years, what has happened to our country, state, and local cities and towns nationwide, especially over the past 30 years in particular?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5890.537s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When the politically correct crowd of progressives and liberals began complaining that our public displays of patriotism is offensive to others, and we have to back off such displays, and that we are a systematically racist country as well as a city, and that we need to practice cancel culture, wokeness, defund the police, teach systematic race theory, and being a white supremacist,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5919.918s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and accept revisionary history as history's new truth, I take offense to such broad universal commentaries, especially by Washington politicians and self-serving proclaimed educators who have made their living by espousing race as their financial and social calling card for more than the past 20 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5946.933s">[Robert Penta]</a>: With crime running at an all time high, illegal immigration crossing our borders, causing ongoing social welfare, educational, security, and uncontrollable medical problems, we have now become the victims of today's liberal and progressives agenda of inclusion without requirement or responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5973.209s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Also, if God offends anyone, then I suggest you consider another part of the world as your new home, because our good God is part of our American inheritance of religious freedoms secure from governmental intervention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5989.062s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if our American stars and stripes offend you, or you do not like or believe in our Uncle Sam, and you don't have the tolerance for free speech, then you should seriously consider exporting yourself to another country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6004.392s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In conclusion,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6006.095s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Our First Amendment gives every citizen the right to express his or her opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6011.277s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But for those who complain, whine, or gripe, or dislike our American way of life, as well as our city of Medford way of life, don't let the door slam you as you leave, because you do have the right and the opportunity to leave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6030.162s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We are not a perfect society.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6033.805s">[Robert Penta]</a>: but there is no other country that offers more freedoms than our America.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6039.968s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So from a Memorial Day remembrance to a Flag Day observation, let not our freedom of thought, speech, and expression ever be challenged by some ideology that bears no fruit but hatred, division, and racism.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6059.422s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you and let our method never be a part of any such movement or agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6066.267s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I felt Mr. President and Councilors, I had to say that because after being at the Memorial Day service and listening to our veterans director emotionally present before our community that for which a veteran is all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6087.122s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I feel as an American.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6091.823s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I am a white Italian American.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6095.306s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm proud of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6096.767s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I am not a racist, and I don't intend to be a racist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6101.191s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I encompass anyone and everyone who wishes to express their opinion, and I would hope that our city of Medford does not go down any path that disrespects the fact of who we are as individuals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6115.943s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8028.474s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert Penton, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8031.136s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I have some, Mr. President, this is our third time we've had this discussion on this high street project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8035.527s">[Robert Penta]</a>: at the corner of Woobin and Hastings Lane.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8039.609s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I'm a little bit disturbed and recognizing that Mr. Blake, who I've never met, I'm quite sure that he's proficient in what he does, but he makes a comment in his response to you by saying fire trucks may have to use the entire opposite lane to make the turns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8057.819s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And by doing that, Mr. President, what you are doing, you are exposing the city of Medford to a tremendous amount of liability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8066.106s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if the city is going to go forward and leave that island there, then it should be part of the official record here that the Medford City Council does not support, but rather condones the fact that that island can now cause a potential hazard to the city of Medford's liability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8087.682s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We've spoken to MBTA buses, there's no mention in here on the extra long tankers that carry gas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8094.305s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The other day coming down high street toward the charter circle, there was a bicyclist there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8101.329s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you know those trucks once they have that weight, they're moving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8105.631s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And he was people in the home because the bike was just taking his time going through that little pathway there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8112.254s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So all I can say is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8114.752s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's there, it's in writing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8116.914s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the city council now has enough, if you're really strong in this position, and I think you are, you have an affirmative position to make by way of a vote that the city of Medford, the Medford city council opposes that particular island that's put there because the acknowledgement from your own traffic commissioner says,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8135.872s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The fire trucks might have to go on the complete opposite lane to make its turn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8140.835s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What about a car coming the opposite way?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8143.377s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What about the bump out that's over there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8145.058s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What about the second island?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8147.18s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What about the bump out that's in front of the house, in front of the man's driveway, in front of the Brooks School?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8153.804s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It makes no sense at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8155.925s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And go further down into West Method on the corner of High Street and Sagamore Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8160.789s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Look what they already have penciled out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8163.571s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's on to the middle of the street almost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8166.353s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These aren't traffic calming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8168.174s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These are traffic accidents just waiting to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8171.115s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you've got to understand the route traffic and the type of traffic that's on those routes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8175.958s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think you brought it up last week, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8178.339s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A truck going up the hill, they've got to pick up the speed to get up the hill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8181.86s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Look at the buses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8182.741s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What are you going to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8184.282s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And right there at that intersection, there's a bump out there, which makes further no sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8189.904s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I don't know, Mr. Blake.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8191.485s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Like I said, I've never met you and I don't know you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8194.487s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I don't know how you can put in writing that a firetruck can go in the opposite lane to make its turn if it has to because of an emergency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8203.774s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You are now indicating that the city is exposing itself to a liability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8209.659s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if that's what the state is going to be doing throughout the rest of the city, with these locations, with these prompts, causing problems with side streets because of buses,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8220.885s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and cars cannot be going down there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8222.728s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What are we getting all this money for the state for if the city has no input into providing common sense use of the money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8233.145s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a damn shame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8234.899s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that we have to be discussing, you folks have to be discussing something that common sense tells you by just going there and looking at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8242.545s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you can paint and stripe the streets all you want with your yellow lines, you're not gonna get rid of those islands.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8248.249s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you're not going to get rid of the fact that coming up or going down in a winter's day storm, and if there's ice in the road, and if there's an emergency that has to take place, somebody is gonna get killed there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8261.279s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you already have it now in writing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8264.18s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Your traffic supervisor has now told you in writing that a fire truck can go on the opposite lane if he can't make the turn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8272.283s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What does that tell you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8273.423s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What does that tell you about the Commonwealth of Massachusetts coming in here trying to tell the city of Metro, we know what's best for your streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8281.166s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Tell them to take their money back and mind their business and let the city of Metro to its engineering department and through citizen input, take each section one at a time to realize what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8294.052s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's all right for somebody to come in here and tell you what to do, but it isn't all right for you to tell them, possibly you maybe made a mistake.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8303.038s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You haven't thought this out correctly or possibly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8306.181s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, you're the president of this council, the six of you, you make seven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8310.804s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would strongly, I strongly advise and suggest that some one of you, if not all of you put a resolution on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8318.851s">[Robert Penta]</a>: indicating that you do not, you are against, and you don't accept the fact that that island in the middle of High Street, Reuben, Hastings Lane, serves in the best interest of the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8331.656s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If anything, it does not serve in the best interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8334.897s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you have the letter from your own traffic supervisor who says the same thing, traffic consultant, excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3856.492s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Good evening, name and address of the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3857.873s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Bob Penta, former member of the Saugus body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3860.935s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I would be remiss not to come up here because as a prior member of the Smith City Council, I think it was only on three separate occasions that I had the honor of recognizing a young gentleman who became an Eagle Scout.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3873.745s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Tonight, it's a distinct pleasure because in today's day and age, you don't even hear of the term of an Eagle Scout.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3879.029s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't hear about the dedication that a young man would put<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3883.072s">[Robert Penta]</a>: into doing something positive, not only for the community, but for himself, recognizing he needs to be a success for the future because that's what this is all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3893.046s">[Robert Penta]</a>: being self-made and going forward, being a graduate of the vocational school, that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3897.507s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Going into the electrical department, that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3900.048s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Being an electrician, that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3902.389s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the one thing that everyone seems to be missing today about youngsters, whether they're male or females, is the fact that they have this self-worth of wanting to do something that benefits the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3914.512s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And just by looking at him and looking at the six years that it took him and his family that's here, it's a proud moment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3921.114s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And not only is it a proud moment, it speaks well for the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3925.311s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't hear too much about scouts today in the news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3927.933s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If anything, you may hear some more negative than positive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3930.975s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But this gentleman represents the positive part of what our city is all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3936.039s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It represents why Medford is what it is, because they have the ingredients, the intelligence, and the drive of a good, young, honest man who wants to make not only his life better, but our city of Medford better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3949.57s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So like I said, I would be remiss not to come up here and say that because I think this is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3954.534s">[Robert Penta]</a>: a distinct honor, not only for this gentleman, but also for the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3959.317s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6254.491s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass, former member of the Saugus Party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6259.976s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Last week, we had an interesting conversation that you started, Mr. President, regarding this little bit of an island that supposedly has found its way at the corner of Woburn and High Street and Hastings Lane.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6271.898s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I spent some time during this past week, once again, speaking to bus drivers, members of our fire department, as it relates to the question that I believe the council asked, and I don't think any of you ever got the answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6285.262s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Whose idea was it to authorize, to put that file in there, in the middle of the street?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6290.924s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you can just anticipate as bus drivers do, and as a fire truck would do, in an emergency, snowstorm, whatever it might be, just take one of those big,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6300.754s">[Robert Penta]</a>: tankers to deliver gas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6303.175s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And in the wintertime, if in fact they happen to be coming down the street and there's some ice or whatever it might be, what about the bike people where the bike lane no longer exists anymore and it's not to be found?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6313.94s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if they ever decide to put that bike lane in the middle of the street in between the two islands that are there, not the single one, the two islands there, you've got a real serious problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6323.344s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So my question to you, Mr. President, is the city engineers still online?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6343.159s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is he still online?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6343.959s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Can we ask the question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6345.16s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Um, the traffic engineer is not online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6347.562s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What about the city engineer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6348.863s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm quite sure an engineering plan has to take place to put that in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6354.667s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Unfortunately, he's not online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6356.58s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So with that being said, Mr. President, they continue to keep going on and doing work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6360.702s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you just take a look at the idea, if in case there's an emergency and a fire truck has to make it down that street and make that left-handed turn in a snowstorm, you have a problem just facing you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6372.008s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've got a bump out coming out there on the corner of Woolman and High Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6376.01s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's just, how do you allow things like this to happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6380.012s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm not saying the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6381.484s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would hope that the council would make a concerted effort to have the city stop that process and actually go out there and look at it, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6391.513s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That path coming down on the corner of Hastings, you've seen it, we've talked about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6397.939s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That thing is so narrow, it's an accident waiting to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6401.323s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And is that what the city has to do, wait for the accident to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6404.706s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Correct it before that even happens, and the island should be as a matter of fact they're keeping both islands there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6412.235s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Whoever comes up with bad enough going down high street toward West Midland right near opposite the Brooks School, there's a bumper right in front of somebody's house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6420.9s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It makes no sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6422.621s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Who comes up with these ideas?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6424.523s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, it would be nice if you want to talk about public safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6427.324s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6427.965s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It would be nice to maybe have the council think about it or have them involved with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6432.667s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I don't know if these are state people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6434.389s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know if these are city contractors or if this is the city itself that's doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6438.531s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But between the bump outs and that section right there, right there on the corner of High Street, Hastings Lane and Rubin Street, that is a disaster waiting to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6447.975s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I would hope this council takes an aggressive action and holds the city accountable and not continue further with that and get rid of that island.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6455.719s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It just makes no sense at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6457.279s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You'd have to be a complete moron not to understand coming down High Street, that road is so narrow,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6464.658s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Just think of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6466.279s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Both ways, both ways, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6469.08s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Both ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6469.901s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's a shame that none of you have gotten an answer back and you asked for that a week ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6474.442s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Public safety and not even an answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6517.98s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you've got the bumper right over there as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6521.983s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm picking up one other point that Council Marks alluded to, because apparently there's been no updating as to the streets, as the sidewalks being a little bit wider in the bike lane.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6531.65s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So since none of that has taken place, and you have people coming down High Street in that bike lane, they're going to traverse right into that middle of maybe 8 to 10 feet wide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6546.586s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would hope one of you on this council would make a motion to just put a stop in that project to fully have a complete public safety review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6556.934s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's up and it can also be taken down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6610.339s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6611.26s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I thank you for listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6612.543s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I know you've seen it, we've had this discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6615.225s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And again, I would something, hopefully, you know, things are made to be corrected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6619.407s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's why there's a racist on pencils.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6620.968s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's why sometimes having something like this really be taken a look at in the interest of public safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6627.111s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it makes a lot of sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6628.652s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6629.172s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1961.812s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, former member of the Saugus body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1965.595s">[Robert Penta]</a>: During this past week, I've had two conversations with two separate bus drivers from the MBTA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1970.44s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And their question is, cause I can't answer it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1972.141s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So since you do have the city engineer online, they think this is a complete hasty comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1978.755s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Safety has it as Councilor Caraviello and a few of you alluded to, to having this island that sticks out on the corner of High Street and Woburn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1986.619s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So since we have the city engineer, could you please answer the question, whose idea was to put that island there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1993.022s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And did that island come in as an afterthought to this construction project?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1996.944s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because if that's the case, then I would strongly suggest that you folks recommend that that be removed before someone gets killed here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2005.405s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Can we ask the question, please, to the city engineer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2055.541s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But with that being said, Mr. President, going back to what Councilor Marks and others have alluded to, the bike lane and the taking a property coming up high street and then getting to that intersection going down the hill, that seems to be have bypassed whatever was supposed to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2070.548s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you're asking for something now that this council has already voted on and there's been a change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2076.291s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I get the impression that this council has not been advised of these changes and the bike route.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2082.586s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and the island that went there, because it appears that that island, I mean, you're talking about safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2088.687s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let's talk about the traffic safety before the, you already have a crosswalk right there at the corner of Hastings Lane going across.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2096.069s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the island comes out a little bit more, it comes over in the area that's pushed out where, in front of the other island that's already there, that's gonna be gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2103.11s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you have to take into consideration in the wintertime, buses coming down the street, heavy duty trucks, ambulances that have to get there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2110.652s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're looking at a serious,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2112.587s">[Robert Penta]</a>: vehicular emergency situation that's going to happen there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2116.991s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I would strongly suggest that that island can be removed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2120.555s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It should be removed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5900.88s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5902.181s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, I'm Bob Pento, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5905.126s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Rick just jogged my mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5906.887s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The city has in its Department of Public Works, anytime a street is opened by a public utility, there is a bond that they have to place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5914.489s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe it's gone from five to $10,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5917.63s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think what really needs to be checked, if you wanna get into this review as Rick suggested, and he's absolutely right, have those bonds been taken out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5925.393s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is the city sitting on any kind of money in its legal department or the Department of Public Works?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5930.535s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because one of the big complaints before when the streets were being dug up by utilities,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5934.26s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They weren't being put back in the way they were or made better than what they were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5938.122s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And many streets are like that in the city, national grids coming in, they've done that on numerous occasions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5942.844s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So as a result of that, I think it's something that you probably should look into.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5946.405s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Have they filed anything by way of a bond with the city as it relates to this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5951.267s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And more importantly, when you talk about the residents not getting their fair share out of this whole thing, Councilor Marx is right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5958.55s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because if in that agreement, in that purchase and whatever you want to call it, that agreement between the city and Eversource, it keeps going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5966.716s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as we know, and I'll ask Councilor Knight, Vice President Knight, if you look at all those additions that they've had since 2015, I guarantee you that the personnel that started this aren't the same personnel that's there right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5980.305s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if that's the case, that's where the city is losing out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5983.186s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So that's why you need it hard and fast right up front when the contract is signed,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5987.714s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Once again, what are they putting up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5989.034s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Are they putting up a million or two million?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5991.035s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Whatever the contingency might be, but you have it right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5994.076s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have it already built into the Department of Public Works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5996.737s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When the public utility comes into the city, they have to place a bond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6000.898s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if they don't place the bond, they don't get their money back as it relates to the work that they've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6006.239s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And there has to be what they call a performance bond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6008.857s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's the term, performance bond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6010.519s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if that's not in the contract and they are digging up the street and Eversource is in fact utility, then shame on the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6017.245s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if you do have it, then maybe that $10,000 ought to be increased to a million or two because of the magnitude and the scope of the project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6024.812s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So thank you, Rick Orlando, you jog my memory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2129.098s">[Robert Penta]</a>: on numerous occasions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2130.139s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if he had an opinion to make, he would make it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2132.94s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And he would tell you right to your face what he thought of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2134.881s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's the same way he acted when he was a police officer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2137.983s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If he made an infraction of the law, you were guilty of doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2141.344s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then if he wanted to give you a break, that would be a separate story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2144.326s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the interesting part about Harold is I think he represents what a lot of people try to do to a police officer today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2153.804s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They try to make them look like a bad person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2156.706s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're not out there for the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2159.007s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's the worst message you can send out there right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2162.849s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Harold McGillivray was a policeman's policeman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2166.611s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And he represents every single policeman that puts that uniform on every day, puts that gun, puts that badge, and goes out there to defend the people of the community that they're in, whether it's city, county, state, or whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2181.099s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would hope that the people of Medford not only appreciate the fact that Harold McGillivray and the family and his two sons, who are also police officers in the city, are going to have their father's name be put on the plaque that represents what law enforcement is in this country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2198.276s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're there to help and defend the people, and that's what it should be about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2203.544s">[Robert Penta]</a>: not to debunk them, but to defend them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2206.407s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's a shame that anyone tries to do anything to take away from the integrity of what a police officer is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2212.933s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And to Mr. Harold McGillivray, I thank him very much because I enjoyed him and he was a good supporter of mine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2218.819s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And because of that, I support him as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2221.041s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6750.182s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6752.482s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm at the NASS, former member of the Sawyer-Gasparti.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6755.643s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I want to, at the outset, I'd like to thank former Councilor Doherty for coming forward because her points of vote are very cogent because Memorial Day is right around the corner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6767.253s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's probably the most sacred of all our veterans holidays during the course of the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6774.916s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And for this city to go forward and look for an exemption to eliminate veterans in a police exam preference says an awful lot of things as it relates to where are we going?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6787.602s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, where are we going as a community and as elected officials?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6791.984s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know the real sad part about this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6794.415s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is gonna be the 30th year in Washington, D.C.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6798.697s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that the veterans have had their annual motorcycle parade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6801.939s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's the first time that it's being canceled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6805.321s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's being canceled because allegedly of COVID.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6808.822s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But on the same day, BLM is having their parade and cannabis is having their event on the same day, same times as the schedule for the AMVETS 30th anniversary motorcycle parade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6823.795s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's a little bit of a disconnect here and maybe of a political, where do we go and who is in support of who and whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6830.777s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'll tell you my experience about my free speech being infringed upon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6835.758s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's a group in Method called Method Mass Politics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6839.479s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The issue was the Christopher Columbus School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6842.06s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now I expressed my opinion on that page, like I've done on many pages here on the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6848.162s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I've been called every conceivable thing that you can think of on that page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6853.679s">[Robert Penta]</a>: on that group by members in that group and leaving no expert is out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6859.662s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Just use your imagination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6862.783s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's free speech.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6865.644s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if they want to say it, and if they're not going to be scolded because of being the appropriateness of their language, then so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6874.108s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I shouldn't be chastised or anyone else be chastised for going on that page or any other page and expressing your opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6881.571s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Just like Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6882.092s">[Robert Penta]</a>: D'Antonio said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6883.4s">[Robert Penta]</a>: just like Councilor Doherty said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6885.182s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And when you are on a board and a commission of this community, common sense dictates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6891.248s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because that's what you're here for, to listen to both sides of whatever the issue might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6896.293s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Common sense dictates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6897.995s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be working here in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6902.88s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know what I resent the most?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6904.804s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I resent the most when people say, I'm white, I was born privileged, and I have a spoon in my mouth, and I can take advantage of anything, or I have taken advantage of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6916.123s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When I look at all of you, you're all white, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6919.404s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You work for what you got nothing's been handed down to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6923.085s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I resent the fact that anyone would turn around and tell me that I'm a racist because I'm white.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6928.866s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I've been privileged because I'm white because nobody knows my life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6932.507s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Nobody knows my background, how I got to where I am.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6936.228s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And just because I served in government for 39 years, which is the greatest honor I've ever had, outside of being married and having children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6944.289s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No one can take away that feeling of serving the people<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6948.743s">[Robert Penta]</a>: but you serve the people not to denigrate the people, you serve them to build them up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6954.187s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And when you start to tell little kids today in school, that you've got to be ashamed whether you're white, black, blue or brown, that's wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6962.434s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Don't do that to a little kid in our public school education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6967.258s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm gonna switch gears real quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6969.619s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The city of Medford has just been, I've read in patch today, city of Medford is getting $37,500,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6977.215s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if the city of Medford is getting $37,500,000, as Councilor Marks alluded to earlier on this evening, I guess the better question is, you guys have got a budget coming up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6987.604s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if you have a budget coming up, why should you discuss a budget when you're anticipating under the American Recovery Act, this $37 million, you're gonna get it all at once, you're gonna get it over a year, how are you going to get it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7000.111s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You people should have a committee of the whole meeting with the mayor present to tell you how this money is going to be disseminated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7006.933s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In 2007 and 2009, when this country had its economic problems, the monies that were given out back then couldn't compete against the needs that the communities have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7016.836s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, now it's a little bit different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7019.116s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're getting $37 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7020.717s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a tremendous amount of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7022.937s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you got to look at some of the things that can be used for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7025.859s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And to me, the first question is, it's looming right around the corner from all of you in 2029, you've got an approximately $30 million unfunded pension liability that no one still talks about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7038.248s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Who's gonna pay for that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7039.209s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How's it gonna be paid?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7040.33s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is it gonna be included in this money that you're going to be getting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7043.733s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These are questions you really need to ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7046.054s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Also, it talks about paying premium pay for the people who did work during the COVID-19.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7054.24s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, how are you going to disseminate that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7055.861s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is it going to be first responders?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7057.342s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is it going to be fire?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7058.142s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is it going to be police?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7059.583s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Who's it going to be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7061.284s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think you really need to sit down and have this conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7064.766s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let me ask you, have you people have been notified already that you're getting $37 million or did you just read about it in the paper?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7072.39s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, Mr. President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7075.072s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have not received it, but it's okay for transparency, for the patch to have it, but the council not to have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7082.275s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My suggestion strongly to folks, all of you, whether you're sitting here or the two that are sitting home, that you sit down with the mayor and her staff to discuss what that $37,500,000 is all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7095.559s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Point of information, Mr. President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7150.169s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Through the chair, Mr. President, it also indicates that you can get premium pay for essential workers and you can offer additional support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7156.493s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you can also, the money can also go into the educational park and the educational park for which a lot of these kids have gone through, they have suffered over the past year for emotional disabilities that kids have been able to suffer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7168.872s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and we won't get it to the people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7170.032s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We'll just leave it like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7172.773s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There is money there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7173.794s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's broken down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7174.534s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's six categories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7176.235s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm not gonna go through all six of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7177.435s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm just saying, thank you, Council Vice President Knight, but I think you really need to sit down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7182.257s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And before you take one vote on this budget coming up, you should know exactly how and when that money's coming in and what it can be used for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7189.6s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And just as a third point, let's go back to the money that they wanna use to take the $500,000 out of that retained earnings account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7198.946s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We are well beyond the 10 year, 10 to 12 year minimum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7203.395s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're into almost the 15th year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7205.372s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have batteries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7207.033s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Batteries are not calculating properly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7209.055s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's going to reflect on people's bills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7210.997s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's going to be, it was 795 abatements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7217.963s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7219.003s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, listen, wait a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7220.204s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're talking about money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7221.165s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're coming close to our 10 minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7222.586s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm sorry, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7223.948s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It does talk about money that can be used for infrastructure and water and sewer and water and sewer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7230.613s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And water and soil.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7231.735s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7233.376s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's my right to say my free speech, and it's my time to say what I want to say, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7239.483s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay, that's the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7241.084s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Don't shut somebody off if they're making a point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7308.401s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7308.962s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, with all due respect to the unfunded liability, if you look at the budget for the last four years, it's not been funded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7315.843s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4015.304s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4016.144s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4017.645s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm a member of the Society of Sprite.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4019.848s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I want to go back to the December of 2002.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4022.61s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And at that point in time, there was a gentleman by the name of Donald Ouellette, who became the city engineer here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4031.658s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And one of the reasons why he became the new city engineer is because he came from the community of Air Mass, where he instituted a new water metering program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4042.567s">[Robert Penta]</a>: At the time, Paul Guia was our director of public works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4046.37s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And in December of 2002,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4048.535s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. Roulette came on board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4051.176s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In January 20th of 2003, Councilor Marks and myself at the time were interviewed by the local newspaper for the purposes of the concerns that were out in the neighborhood regarding the water meter and the bills that were going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4067.242s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And at that point in time, information came forward that for the past three years, prior to 2003, there were over 709 abatements<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4077.335s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that were issued by the city of Medford because of faulty water meters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4082.259s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. Roulette, when he came in, indicated that the city of Medford's water meters at that time were no more, they should be no more than 10 years of age.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4091.225s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They were 17 years old at the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4095.208s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So that began the crusade, so to speak, of figuring out how are we going to change these water meters?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4102.013s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Should we change these water meters?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4103.534s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And when are we going to do it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4105.687s">[Robert Penta]</a>: At the time, there was over 15,000 households that had water meters that needed to be changed, as well as 150 large capacity commercial district people, which represented 50% of the water consumption and the use at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4123.961s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, in August of 2003, the concerns kept multiplying on the council from residents complaining about their tax bills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4134.294s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And October 23rd, in a very rare moment by former Mayor McGlynn, he acknowledged at a public meeting that it was his fault that the meters were not changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4144.72s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the reason is the concern wasn't as bad as it was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4148.502s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And he told the Water and Soil Commission at that point in time that blame me, that was his quote, blame me because they just didn't want to get into the financial obligation of getting into the water meters, not realizing how serious everything was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4161.809s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4163.279s">[Robert Penta]</a>: because that got itself corrected after that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4166.241s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then on February 17 of 2004, Mayor McGlynn presented before the city council a prelude, a prelude so to speak as to what the water meter sewer count should look like and what do we need to do here to go in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4183.255s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But what he did and what he proposed, which was kind of interesting, he proposed to finance $18,000<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4189.402s">[Robert Penta]</a>: have the city council vote for $18,000 to do a preliminary review on X amount of homes and X amount of businesses in the city, just to see how bad these water meters were in commercial meters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4201.666s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what they found out was an atrocious, the decision or the results were atrocious, because what came out of all of that, where these meters were running much slower, and as a result of them running much slower, the city was losing a tremendous amount of revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4215.75s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So in October of 2004,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4219.526s">[Robert Penta]</a>: straight down October 19th, the city council voted the appropriation for $4.2 million to put new water meters here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4228.13s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And subsequent to that, the chase goes on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4231.272s">[Robert Penta]</a>: At that point in time, and that's back in 2003, at the end of 2003, the city of Medford was losing on a daily basis 189 million gallons of water a day, not getting billed, and their leakage was 113 million gallons a day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4248.325s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Those two numbers, and I would hope somebody in the council would pick up on that and make a request as to what our leakage is and loss of revenue from then it is now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4258.407s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The new water meters that came in, once again, had a 10 year lifespan and the meters on this new meeting system, they had batteries in their battery life, according to their own information that they passed up as a 10 year life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4275.433s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We've well exceeded a 10 year life on these batteries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4279.515s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe most recently there have been some concerns with people who have gotten their bills and their bills have been higher or lower than expected than what they received in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4291.819s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I really think as the concern is for parking in the city, the concern should equally be as where are we going?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4298.141s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're sitting on over $5 million in your water and sewer enterprise account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4302.043s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There needs to be some addressing to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4303.743s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When is it going to take place?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4305.988s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if it's, if in fact, they're accurate in their information that they submitted and they gave us at the time when the council voted on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4314.633s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think council Max was the only one on the council at the time when we voted on this, something really needs to be done because you're gonna find yourself right back to where you were before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4323.879s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If in fact, 10 years is the mandate as their brochure says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4329.262s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So with that being said, I would hope somewhere along the line, what a 10 year battery and a 10 year life of the meter<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4335.555s">[Robert Penta]</a>: something needs to be looked at because we're going to find ourselves right back into the same problem that we were when they were 17 years of age and you brought in a new person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4344.78s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Second comment, Mr. President, I think it was three weeks ago when I appeared before here, when they were talking about the 5G situation, I said at that point in time that I believed, I believed, and it's my mistake, I misquoted myself,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4359.93s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe that that time that one of the people who happens to be the director of public, what's her name?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4366.774s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Public health at that point in time had voted for some of the passing and not for passing some of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4374.519s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Sort of like split down the middle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4376.36s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I want to thank council Max.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4377.641s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I want to compliment him because of his institution of pushing forward the folks that had their place, not have that 5G go in front of their house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4390.984s">[Robert Penta]</a>: at their last meeting, I think that sets the tempo for people to stand up and say, hey, you can fight the government and you can push them back if you have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4398.83s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They've set the standard now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4400.832s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And people out there, if you don't want that 5G in front of your house, now's your time to complain because they've already set the trademark.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4406.917s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the council, I believe the vote was four to nothing on that particular issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4413.262s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Two last comments, and they go like this, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4416.125s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The two gentlemen that you just talked about, Tom Kianciano and Bob McGovern,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4420.21s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think the underlying issue there to their lives are that they were born and bred in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4426.836s">[Robert Penta]</a>: True Medford family folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4429.899s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Something that's very hard to understand today for people who just move in here, who think that even though they've been here for 10 to 15 years, they know Medford like somebody in their family who's lived here their whole life, who's been well respected within the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4445.132s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They both happen to have a Wellington background.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4448.135s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And they both happen to have a big family background, something that's hard to find today and to be respected for and to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4455.678s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So with that being said, I congratulate you for bringing the issue of dedicating the meeting on their behalf.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4461.581s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think it's a true honor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4463.962s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think also would be a true honor for this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4466.962s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're getting ready to deal with your budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4468.483s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's coming up pretty soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4470.184s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is a big issue as far as I'm concerned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4472.144s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If I was running for office right now, I would be running to find out where are and is the money for these meters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4479.088s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Do they have to be replaced?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4480.348s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When are they going to be replaced?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4482.129s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And how and where is the money going to be found?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4484.13s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Are they going to take it out of the Water and Sewer Enterprise account or what have you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4488.712s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is serious money and this is serious community money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4492.294s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And let me just leave you with one last thought, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4494.194s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'd like to ask you a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4495.72s">[Robert Penta]</a>: because I look forward to every Tuesday night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4498.002s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You started this about three or four weeks ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4500.324s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't hear any more from the director of public health on an update as to what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4504.948s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And is there a reason for that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4515.277s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if I remember correctly, the one week she couldn't come, she gave you a written synopsis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4519.46s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I haven't heard, I haven't heard anything like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4521.96s">[Robert Penta]</a>: because people look forward to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4523.22s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I would just hope maybe, you know, that gets itself reinstituted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4526.901s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But as far as just getting back real quick on the water meters and the whole idea of the meters, it's going to turn out to be a big issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4534.722s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's going to be a financial concern for this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4536.703s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I'm quite sure when council Marks and myself at that point in time in 2003, we viewed 709 abatements having been filed because the meters were not cooperating correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4550.485s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And thankfully, Mayor McGlynn finally understood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4552.527s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's the reason why he put the appropriation in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4555.268s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't want to get yourself into that position again right now, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4559.111s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't think it will serve you any good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4561.413s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I have all the records here of everything that took place, how we got to where we got at that point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4568.658s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I would hope that the council does not find themselves in that same position again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4572.741s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4573.642s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5226.179s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5226.319s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, just one quick, Council Marks and Council Falco are both correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5231.94s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The software that the city was supposed to purchase would cost anywhere between 100 and 115,000 at the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5238.501s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And they figured that the reason that they would save the money on that is just think about all the abatements that you would not have to service, the people that would have to leave work or whatever it might be to come to a hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5248.242s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And sometimes if they didn't even win on their abatement process, they'd have to take that to the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5252.853s">[Robert Penta]</a>: district go over and some of them, but Councilor Falco is absolutely right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5257.475s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The way the program was sold is you were going to have an abatement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5261.037s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You were going to have a program with a software.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5263.598s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if any house spiked irregularly, they would contact the taxpayer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5268.301s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It should not be the taxpayer contacting the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5271.342s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think that's the key.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5273.764s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That was the key as Councilor Markswell alluded to and Councilor Falco.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5277.446s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's just, you know, when you say out of sight out of mind, but that's not right either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5282.689s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's the biggest, other than doing a public works street or a sidewalk, it's the biggest financial obligation that the city has to its taxpayers as it relates to make sure that the water and sewer system works properly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5297.121s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if it's not working properly and there is something wrong with the infrastructure below the street, below the sidewalk, how's the taxpayer gonna know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5304.987s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When in fact you're collecting, you're raising the taxes each and every year, you're raising the rates each and every year,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5310.664s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You supposedly have this system and you're still telling the taxpayer, you've got to call city hall to find out what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5317.209s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That doesn't make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5318.41s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I think you get your work cut off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11502.76s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The mic isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11504.081s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Bob Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11506.782s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, I appreciate the fact that this is an ongoing thing, and I want to compliment Councilor Marks<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11512.329s">[Robert Penta]</a>: because speaking throughout the community, he has taken the charge on this particular issue, not to be for or against, but just to bring the awareness and to have some understanding of a communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11523.492s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As I said before, this is a $5 billion G5 undertaking by Verizon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11529.913s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And some two years ago, when they first came into the city and had a discussion on this, they allegedly stated there was 143 locations or 143 polls<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11539.053s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that they had identified here in the city of Medford as to where they were gonna go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11542.796s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, these poles are all owned by National Grid and on National Grid's poles, you have fire, you have police, you have alarm systems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11550.541s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're all pole renters and they pay National Grid to be on those poles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11556.185s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And by paying National Grid to be on those poles, National Grid is now receiving a financial inducement, so to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11566.468s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In return, that inducement doesn't find itself anywhere back to the rate payers of National Grid, but all Verizon is doing is getting more and more profit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11576.754s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And they're not spending $5 billion just for the sake of having $5 billion to spend, because the subscribers to Verizon plans are gonna pay for that in the long run.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11586.159s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's been no explanation as between 4G to 5G, whether there's anything medically or substantially different,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11594.226s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that could possibly hurt somebody because of the medical portions of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11598.448s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the question then becomes, and alluding back to council Marx's comment, if you have the lady who is a board of health director, who sits on this board of four, which makes no sense at all, but who sits on this board of four, you've had 11 votes so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11613.676s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And of those 11 votes, six of them have been against and five of them had been for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11619.983s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, I would strongly suggest that you would ask, some one of you folks, ask a question of why the people voted the way they did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11628.165s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because if you understood last week, there was two young ladies here from a certain part of Medford who was concerned about a poll being in front of their house and the poll being in front of their house, not wanting it there, not knowing what the 5G could admit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11641.748s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So of the five that got approved as compared to the six that didn't get approved,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11646.181s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Do the six have an argument against the five or does the five have an argument against the six?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11650.363s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Are we going to play what kind of game is this going to turn out to be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11653.884s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Who gets it and who doesn't get it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11655.625s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11656.966s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the most important thing that I think is missing here that the mayor of this community, having this committee being sent up should have made some kind of an agreement with Verizon as to what the city of Medford is going to get in return<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11669.793s">[Robert Penta]</a>: for having Verizon come into this city and go from 4G to 5G, because the only one right now that's going to be making all the money up front is going to be National Grid on the poles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11678.997s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And Verizon in the long run will get this, whether it goes to 5G, 6G, 7G, who knows, that's not the point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11684.88s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The fact of the matter is they're here, they were planning for it as of two years ago, whether it's 143 poles or 143 locations, that seems to be the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11694.344s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if you're going to have this meeting,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11696.345s">[Robert Penta]</a>: this meeting, however this meeting is going to be sent up, what's the logic?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11700.267s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What's the reasoning behind approval and disapproval?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11704.028s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if the director of public health voted against it, and even if it was because she felt that it wasn't right for the city, then it's not right for the city all the time, not just part of the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11715.913s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And those people that voted for it, as compared to the six times they didn't vote for it, well, what was their logic to it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11722.569s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think it's very important that if they're going to make a decision, and you said there's 11 requirements on there, then those 11 requirements have to be met by all applicants that come, all 42 applicants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11734.674s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if that's being said, there's no logic, there's no rhyme or reason right now to the 11 decisions that have been made thus far, six for, six against, and five for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11744.459s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How do you justify that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11745.619s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How do you explain to the city that you have this committee of ongoing people with no experts on there<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11752.674s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That doesn't make any sense at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11754.217s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And when the taxpayers can ask that question, you have this subcommittee that's not even odd number, it's even.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11762.83s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and you're being restricted according to FCC that you can't vote because of any medical concerns, but you have your own director of public health on the committee and she votes against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11774.722s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, what's her logic for voting against it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11777.505s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What are all the other members who voted against it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11780.348s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What was their logic?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11781.649s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what was the logic of the five that got approved?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11784.953s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's important to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11786.795s">[Robert Penta]</a>: because you're going to play playing this game with 40 somewhat applications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11790.477s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Some get it, some don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11792.217s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Some streets get it, some don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11794.058s">[Robert Penta]</a>: One house has it, another one doesn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11795.799s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what are you going to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11797.26s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Wind up having a lawsuit between people in the city saying, hey, how can you give it to one and not another?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11802.622s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I didn't want it there, but you let it be there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11804.983s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's a good suggestion you came up with, Councilor Marks, because if somebody wants to come and put a poll in a particular area, then maybe they should<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11812.102s">[Robert Penta]</a>: come in advance, say this is where we'd like to do it, and get a find out, let's find out if people are for it or against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11819.106s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the one thing you forgot to mention on whether it's Burlington or Cambridge, they've got a committee, they've got a committee that's uniform, either it's for or against, it's not split.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11829.872s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you're dealing with a subcommittee or whatever you want to call this committee, that's split, you have no professionals,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11836.445s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No medical experts, you definitely don't have any technical experts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11840.026s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And with that being said, how can anybody trust that whether 5G is better than 4G, medically or otherwise, it doesn't exist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11848.369s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But this city is allowing a multi-billion dollar corporation to come in and right now, nobody knows if the city of Medford is getting anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11858.172s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Nobody knows if this mayor has made any kind of an agreement with Verizon to come in here and do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11863.354s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the only ones that are gonna get rich in the long run<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11866.596s">[Robert Penta]</a>: is going to be rising in the long run and national grid up front, and your rates aren't going to go down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11872.002s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So what have you accomplished?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11873.804s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Or better yet, you've allowed somebody to come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11877.067s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11877.728s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You should have this meeting with that subcommittee, with the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11881.852s">[Robert Penta]</a>: with the legal counsel that you have, and you should bring in a medical and you should bring in a legal expert.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11886.257s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Doesn't make any difference if FCC rules and regulations say you can't vote on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11890.14s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have a determination because if the person that's on the committee is medically entitled with the knowledge to know that the 5Gs<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11898.032s">[Robert Penta]</a>: will not work in behalf of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11899.872s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can't pick and choose what part of the city you want it to go in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11902.893s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It either is or it isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11904.533s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Your technical person will say either it is or it isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11907.454s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can't go from 4G to 5G.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11909.575s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where's your expert to tell you what's the difference between the two?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11912.355s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That hasn't even come out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11915.216s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Oh, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11916.176s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That hasn't even come out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11918.457s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These are important questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11919.677s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So they've already voted on 11 applications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11923.478s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It doesn't make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11925.438s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can't run a professional business on something such as this and then be left out in the cold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11931.404s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And here are seven of you trying to ask questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11933.806s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have one city council who took the bull by the horns and the people appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11939.251s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11940.112s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think all seven of you appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11942.474s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the fact of the matter is one simple question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11946.418s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Who's running the show here, Verizon?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11949.909s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't know, they seem to be running the show.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11952.271s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is it National Grid?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11953.272s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because it's their poll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11954.933s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're allowing to go up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11956.494s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're allowing renters to go up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11958.836s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't have any verification from anybody in the city, from the mayor down, where that transparency is, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11965.121s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It needs to come out, it needs to be found.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11969.524s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if this continues to go on like this, and you folks know me, and that four member committee just keeps going on, and they make those approvals,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11976.758s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, then shame on the people of Medford for electing the administration that has allowed this to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11983.343s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You city council have at least taken your position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11986.325s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But there's a transparency issue here that needs to come forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11989.428s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it has yet to come forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11991.109s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And because of that, somebody is going to have to pay the price for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11994.652s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And hopefully, the 5G doesn't go into neighborhoods where people subsequently medically find out that there was something wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12002.691s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't want to find yourself into like a Johnson and Johnson situation that just came up now with the federal government because people now have a concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12010.335s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's been some bad reactions to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12012.396s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Does that mean that they're all bad?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12013.677s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, it doesn't mean that they're all that they're bad, but you've got plenty of time to test this thing out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12017.999s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If they've been here two years ago, since 2019 and saying that we're going to have 143 locations, and this is now 2021, something is wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12027.524s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If there's been no situation, no communication, I would respectfully ask that one of you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12032.851s">[Robert Penta]</a>: ask the city administration, the mayor's office, what, if anything, is the city of Medford going to get, or is the city of Medford getting, by allowing Verizon to come in and put 5G on these poles?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12045.603s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a money matter, follow the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12047.605s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's all about money, as we all know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12050.007s">[Robert Penta]</a>: $5 billion is not chump change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12052.469s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a huge investment nationwide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12054.972s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And when T-Mobile can rent off the same pole<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12058.922s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that Verizon is putting up, you know, they're all making money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12063.545s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=6521.308s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, I would like to, if the young lady felt insulted, I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=6527.232s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But that's the marketing that Verizon does when they go out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=6530.955s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They go to the lowest socioeconomic areas because that's the ones that they feel that they can move into first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=6538.62s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what I said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4027.53s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4028.17s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As a matter of fact, Mr. President, I'm picking up on your resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4032.483s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that took place in 2016, because at that time it was the second year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4037.987s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I believe along with you and Councilor Knight and then Councilor Brianna Longo, there was some concerns with Park Method and their distribution of how the revenue was going to be coming in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4049.214s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Therefore, as a result of that, what we needed to go to, as I indicated back then, was to go to the contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4057.079s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And in the contract on page five, there is two specific sections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4060.921s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It basically includes<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4062.722s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that states 20 days after the end of each month, a monthly report would be submitted to the city of Medford as it relates to a whole host of issues relative to the inventory of monies taken in and what's going out and what the fees and everything were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4078.631s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Also, there's an inclusion in there that the operator, meaning Park Method, would agree to submit on an annual basis the gross revenue and the operating expenses<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4088.74s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So on an annual basis, so rather than having you go and get all the monthly things, I'm requesting that the council puts a resolution forward, making that request as it relates to their annual revenue, relative to the fact that this is what took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4105.126s">[Robert Penta]</a>: For example, you would have net city parking revenue, that's annual appeals, the annual appeal, dismissal, forgiveness, annual resident visitor parking permits, business permits,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4118.592s">[Robert Penta]</a>: commuter permits, annual parking citations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4122.074s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then we get to the issue on an annual basis of the $50,000 annually that would go to the commercial districts here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4134.08s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now that was something that came up by Mayor McGlynn in, I believe, October of 2014.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4139.923s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as a result of that, that became a bone of consternation between<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4146.513s">[Robert Penta]</a>: the Medford Chamber of Commerce and the business people, and as well as the issue on the city council relative toward the business districts not getting X amount of dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4157.182s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Therefore, as a result of that, what took place was that in October of that year, the city at that time through Mayor McGlynn, and then Park Medford came to a final resolution before January of 2015,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4173.491s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and 15.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4175.412s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And in 2015, that $50,000 for each square was then included as part of the agreement between Park Method and the City of Method.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4184.458s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And in their brochure, they note specifically that $250,000 annually will be subject to the appropriation for district improvements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4193.243s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4194.269s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know where that money is, if it's ever gone there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4197.311s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Some people say it's gone out once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4199.392s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Some people say maybe it has, maybe it hasn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4201.753s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know, I can't answer that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4203.354s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's the reason why I'm asking for this breakdown and how the money was being expended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4209.637s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Next, we have the issue relative toward $2 million a year is what Park Method said that they would bring in annually to the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4220.623s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if we look at that $2 million per year,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4223.996s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And in the contract, there was an inclusion that anything over $1,250,000 annually, the city would increase from its annual 35% net revenues to 83%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4235.479s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The question then becomes where, and if in fact, has Park Method submitted that type of information to the city of Metro?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4243.702s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4244.162s">[Robert Penta]</a>: None of us know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4245.823s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And again, once again, that's the reason why I'm here asking you folks to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4250.902s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So then let's go to the issue that basically talks about, I think it was in October during a city council strike that award six committee candidates on October of 2019.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4263.351s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then council Longo addressed the community at that point in time as it related to the method parking program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4271.838s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Quote, this is what she said, as to parking enforcement, it is broken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4276.86s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If elected, I will end the contract that expires during the next mayoral term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4281.824s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I will go back to the committee recommendations of 2009 to implement in-house enforcement and replace the kiosks with meters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4290.35s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I will provide free parking for our seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4293.532s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The city will benefit by keeping 100% of the gross revenue for our city services and schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4299.036s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We currently see only 35% of the revenues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4302.577s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, that's a tough point right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4304.759s">[Robert Penta]</a>: 35% of the revenues, because we really don't know because you've never received the public documentation back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4309.944s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You, Mr. President, have asked three times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4313.047s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Resolutions go back and suggest that and prove that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4316.67s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So where do we go from there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4318.752s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's the question of why I think you really need to know how much money has come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4324.386s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How has park method delivered as they're supposed to occur, so into the contract and the city of Medford, how they made an accounting for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4331.451s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's public information, it needs to be made public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4334.213s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the question then becomes, if in fact the contract has been adhered to, and if in fact revenues have exceeded that for which the 35% formula has taken place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4348.484s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the question then becomes, if it hasn't taken place,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4352.346s">[Robert Penta]</a>: then where are those revenues?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4355.228s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's also a report that's out that you can go on Google and it's by the Method Parking Commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4362.454s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And they have a report that goes out there that basically says, through their Google webpage, that on an annual basis, the city of Medford is, if you add up their numbers, that the city of Medford has only collected approximately $436,000 per year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4377.567s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4381.485s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Number two, the statistics that the city has in the city of Medford allegedly will substantiate that we're only getting 35% rather than the 83%, which would indicate we haven't exceeded that for which you would get the $1.3 million annual money that they collected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4400.822s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But according to Park Medford, when they first came in, they said that their annual revenue would be in excess of $2 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4406.243s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So $2 million over a period of 20 years, or even over a period of eight years, would give you $16 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4411.845s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're nowhere, we're nowhere near that type of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4415.286s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I would strongly suggest that if this be the case, what really needs to be addressed is as follows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4421.848s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have the 2009 report to which Council Marks served on there with the then former Chief of Police Sacco and a whole list of other folks who made up an extensive and an exhaustive report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4434.952s">[Robert Penta]</a>: as to how much they went to other communities, they checked it out, they saw how the revenues could come in and where it should go in here for the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4442.935s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The question then becomes Mr. President, if elected means she has been elected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4447.837s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So since the mayor has now been elected, the question then becomes the 35%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4452.899s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We really need to get these numbers to find out, are we in the 35% or are we above the 35%?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4458.702s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And lastly, just let me say this, and this is really the perplexing question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4463.063s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If in fact we follow what the mayor<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4465.424s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then city council said in October of 2019, to follow that formula of this report, why then do we have another new committee report of people?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4477.326s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is the mayor going to change plans, change direction, not follow the 2009 report?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4483.107s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think you people really need to know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4484.807s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if people are sitting on that committee and it's gonna be a waste of time because you're just gonna follow the exhausted committee report of 2009, that needs to be relegated out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4494.534s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, this is a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4497.116s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if we're only looking at $436,000 a year as compared to a lot more than that, because we haven't gotten to the $2 million mark per year, you need to know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4506.824s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you really need to have a discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4508.865s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it was you then Councilor, Mr. President and Councilor Knight and Councilor Marks and Councilor Brianna Longo-Cunningham had serious questions with Park Method over this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4518.962s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You indicated, Mr. President, that this is year eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4521.905s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is years eight, nine, and 10 are the years for negotiation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4525.688s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And they're taking them one year at a time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4527.469s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, if they're taking them one year at a time, and the mayor said, and when she ran for mayor, that she was going back and she was going to get rid of Park Method, then the plan ought to be that Park Method's going to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4538.559s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There should be no negotiation to extend anything here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4557.293s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe this is the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4558.713s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I may have the wrong terminology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4559.973s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is the committee to discuss parking in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4604.457s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So then the question that I asked the council and to you, Mr. President, if the mayor indicated she was going to look at the 2009, she was going to adhere to that report, then the traffic, this new committee that's been put together, are they discussing this report to add or subtract?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4619.46s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is the mayor not going to support this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4621.82s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Are she going to entertain another type of situation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4624.441s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because this is very conflicting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4630.427s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, if you're going to be on one year renewals in years eight, nine, and 10, give you the option to bow out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4635.689s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you've had plenty of time to realize coming into your option year that something should be taking place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4641.332s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So are we going to, as a community, take three years in a row as option years and work at it one at a time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4648.355s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4703.148s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, I'd like to answer that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4704.83s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A constant night brings up a good point that three years when it first came up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4709.031s">[Robert Penta]</a>: was nixed by then city solicitor Mark Romney.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4711.992s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He said it would not serve in the best financial interest of the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4716.074s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That bumped up the contract to 10 years, but given years eight, nine, and 10, the flexibility, whether you'd want to renegotiate, get out or whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4725.237s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm only concerned over the fact that you, Mr. President, dating back at least three times going back to 2016, coming forward with council resolution have asked for these numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4735.325s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Senior citizens have been waiting to park for nothing for free, because that's what was alleged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4740.106s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Same comment was made in Inauguration Day, same comment was made in 2009.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4745.708s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if we're not going to follow this report of 2009, which is very extensive, and it wasn't just for the city of Medford, you can correct me Councilor Marks, you went to other cities and towns, you saw how they derived their revenue through meters and their timing, and whether they had resident parking, commuter parking, this and that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4764.068s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If that is not going to really be entertained, I just think that this parking commission, Councilor Scott Bell, it's just a waste of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4771.624s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We either follow something or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4773.964s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Are you going to change it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4774.965s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think the mayor has an obligation to tell you and the taxpayers of this community, whether in fact we're going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4781.546s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why would you want to go into two more years of one year contracts trying to figure out what you're going to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4786.967s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You should know by now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4788.567s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Resolutions dating back to 2016 and 17 with her name and many councilors names on there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4794.189s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Question, just as councilor Knight has indicated, the veracity of this contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4799.33s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, how is it going to work with the city of Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4802.429s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Approximately $2 million in uncollected money is still outstanding again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4808.26s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is on the Google page of the Medford Parking Commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4825.294s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Councilor President, I'm going to disagree with you, because when this council issue came up before the council, it started in May of 2014.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4831.479s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it ran on for a few months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4833.861s">[Robert Penta]</a>: While the mayor and some of the councilors had a difference of opinion,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4836.463s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It did go on, there was some public interaction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4839.305s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if this mayor is going to entertain a new contract without having the council interaction and public awareness and public input, that's bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4847.729s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is really bad because that's not what you call transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5137.58s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, one quick thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5142.001s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Councilor Marks, you talked about Everett, talked about Revere, talked about Somerville, you talked about Boston, Brookline, Malden, and Everett.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5152.483s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A thorough report from the hiring of a clerk to the amount of people that walked the streets and the monies that were collected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5158.605s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're not gonna get more of a thorough report than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5160.705s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this new commission, for whatever the reason is, it's out there and why the mayor is doing it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5165.505s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And nobody knows, but that question ought to be asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5168.166s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you made the commitment in 2019 to do with this one, why are you going in a different direction?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5173.489s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5174.59s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, if I could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5178.432s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Council member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2496.042s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Pentez, Zero Summit Road, Method Nest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2500.766s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think what I have on the agenda is a discussion of Method's pay to park program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2508.811s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I believe you gave me the catalyst to do this, Mr. Caraviello, Council President, because for some years you've asked for a report<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2517.686s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and we really haven't gotten a report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2519.687s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know if you can hear me on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2521.848s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is this coming through?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2524.609s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can hear me, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2526.029s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay, I'd like to go back to, as a quick side note, to September of 2009, when then Mayor McGlynn had a commission set up as it relates to how was parking going to be addressed in the city because it was a revenue item here in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2543.276s">[Robert Penta]</a>: At that point in time, Councilor Marks served on that committee<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2547.489s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And one of their recommendations was to possibly look into having a civilian parking commission in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2554.194s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now that was in 2009.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2557.075s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it didn't take place until I believe it started in May of 2014, when then Mayor McGlynn decided we were going to do something about parking here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2568.983s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as a result of that, from the months of May through the months of December of 2014, we went through<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2576.884s">[Robert Penta]</a>: an arduous task of reviewing how and what packing was going to be here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2583.887s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So what I'm asking for is that a complete breakdown from inception, starting from calendar year 2015, right up to date, be brought forward, and I'm going to pass out something for all you councillors at the end, that we get so not only the U.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2600.995s">[Robert Penta]</a>: councillors, but we as citizens have an idea of just how much money that's coming in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2607.058s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Asking for a complete itemized detail is found in the contract that was signed by the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2614.462s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And at that point in time, the public parking point, I believe has been resold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2619.425s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it states on page five on section six on the gross revenue, it says within 20 days after the end of each month, the operator shall provide to the city a statement showing all revenue, including details<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2633.742s">[Robert Penta]</a>: of citation revenue, meter revenue, permit revenue, and other revenues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2638.225s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this statement must include a copy of the monthly statement from the separate bank accounts utilized by the operator for the payments and received by the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2647.97s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I'm really not asking for anything other than what should be in this building right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2653.073s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the only thing that this building has been able to afford was in the calendar year 2015 and the calendar year 2016, the first report<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2663.213s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that the then city council asked for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2665.895s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And subsequent to that, nothing has come forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2668.496s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe you have asked three times, Mr. President for a report, an itemized report for which the contract says they were obligated to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2676.962s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So we're not asking for anything that's outrageous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2678.963s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's in this building somewhere, somehow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2682.245s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, another thing you need to remember is they said, they meaning Republic at the time, they said that the revenues coming into the city of Medford would be approximately $2 million per year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2693.844s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So right now we're into the end of the seventh year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2696.586s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So that would be approximately $14 million thereabouts to be accounted for according to their terms as it relates to what the revenues would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2706.215s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if you go on the Medford Parking Commission, they have a Google page here from the city of Medford and they extrapolated from Park Medford, a list of outstanding monies that have owned this old, the city of Medford<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2722.214s">[Robert Penta]</a>: since 2015.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2722.534s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In 2015, still owed, if I'm reading it correctly, it's $339,449.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2725.377s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In 2016, it's $368,140.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2725.697s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In 2017, it's $375,611.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2726.157s">[Robert Penta]</a>: 2018, it's $351,470.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2726.518s">[Robert Penta]</a>: 2019, it's $339,449.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2751.378s">[Robert Penta]</a>: $148 and past year 2020 was $163,875.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2758.441s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Again, if I'm reading this correctly, but I'm standing here tonight to be corrected if I'm wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2763.143s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But from reading what Park Method has submitted and what the Method Parking Commission is saying, that's $1,937,693.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2771.947s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's outstanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2772.967s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's still owed here to the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2780.612s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He's a random.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2789.755s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These amounts have yet to be accounted for as being satisfied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2798.498s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, I'm just telling you with the traffic commission, parking commission, excuse me, it's put on their webpage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2805.1s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But again, as I said, I stand here to be corrected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2807.901s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Plus the fact, plus the fact I believe<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2811.574s">[Robert Penta]</a>: the $2 million per year that was indicated was part of what park, I mean, Republic Parking said on October, 2014.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2822.639s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if we look and if these numbers are true, there's a little bit of a problem there, why they haven't been collected upon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2831.024s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But therefore, if we're getting $2 million a year for the last seven years, that's $14 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2837.372s">[Robert Penta]</a>: years eight, nine, and 10, I believe are they're renegotiating yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2840.273s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I really don't know if the city's renegotiating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2842.874s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I know they have a new traffic commission, a group of people looking at where you should go and how you're going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2848.416s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think you guys and Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2850.997s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Morell, you should be up to date as it relates to, you know, what the city is doing with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2856.259s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Another thing is there is, and I believe- Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2863.481s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was an October- What information council members?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2888.475s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Being aware of the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2889.396s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if in fact these numbers are any way correct, that's $1,937,000 takes back to 2015.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2896.071s">[Robert Penta]</a>: there's something wrong with the city not being able to get that money, separate issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2900.634s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Taking that one step forward, in October of 2014, for those of you that might remember, there was the argument of the five squares, Medford Square being one, would get on an annual basis $50,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2913.084s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that was a ball of contention, especially here in the city of Medford, Chamber of Commerce, and then Mayor Mike McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2919.268s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But toward the end of the year, I believe it was in December of 2014, there was an agreement reached<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2925.923s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There was an agreement reached with Park Method as it relates to, they now, they would be willing to submit $250,000 would be earmarked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2937.188s">[Robert Penta]</a>: $250,000 would be earmarked on an annual basis, 50,000 for each square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2940.85s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They put that in their folder, in their folder that they passed out, which specifically states that $250,000 annually be subject to appropriation for the district improvement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2953.375s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's the five districts here in the city of Metro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2955.69s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I know it's been some conversation with the chamber, and I know it's been asked a couple of times, but if that'd be the case, that $50,000 a year going forward for four of the last five years would be approximately $200,000 each square that they haven't seen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2972.333s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Again, the accounting of the money, this goes back to like last week on the water money, on the fees, there has to be an accounting where it's going, how it's being spent, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2983.543s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if you take that, put that all together, Mr. President, Mr. Messenger, could you please pass this up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2990.124s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm asking on this particular issue here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2997.525s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it's important to know that while you might be having a commission or a committee to be looking at the parking revenues, there doesn't seem to be anything going forward because it states on page six, I believe, of the contract<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3013.588s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that this has to be a renegotiating year with the people that we have in the city right now, years eight, nine, and 10, is the city in fact in a negotiation with the parking company?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3031.06s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're on a one year contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3032.2s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3032.941s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So for example, if we're on a one year contract, which is year eight, which we're on right now, it's possible at any point in time, this contract ends at the end of this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3044.375s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So it's up to the administration that that be the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3046.996s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would thank Mr. President if in fact that the two million dollars was the estimated amount that we would be getting on an annual basis and we're looking at 1.9 million plus and monies that are owed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3058.563s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Something's not jiving here because those monies whether they're making the two million dollars a year or not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3065.555s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How do you let each and every year, how do you let that just continue to escalate and escalate and escalate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3070.518s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3071.298s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's unfair to the people who pay every single day to use the meters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3076.08s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's unfair as to the contract as it's written.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3079.942s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So it's either a lack of enforcement or I'm reading these numbers wrong, or there's something wrong on the adding and subtracting of how this money's being spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3089.827s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What you have here, what I gave you comes right out of the contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3094.49s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The contract is even more specific and more definitive as to what you're looking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3099.571s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That, as it's written, tells you basically how much money is coming in and where's the majority of it going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3105.233s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The key point to all of this is whether you stay with the company you have now or you go with a new company, you have an in-house, something has to be considered as it relates to outstanding liabilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3117.755s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you can't run $1,900,000 in an ongoing liability that started from day one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3125.319s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It just doesn't make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3127.3s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I would hope that somebody would make a resolution and ask for an annual breakdown of Park Method.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3135.544s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, what the contract says does for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3143.429s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Say it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3145.57s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, that's what I'm asking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3161.711s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Nobody's going to do it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3165.332s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What are you asking for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3167.913s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What I gave you right there is a sample of what's on page six, section, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3177.395s">[Robert Penta]</a>: For five years, since inception, from 2015, coming forward, how you got to your revenues, how did you get to your receipts, how did you get to your expenses?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3187.37s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've only done it twice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3200.099s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Say it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3447.78s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3450.12s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know if you can hear me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3453.481s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, can you hear it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3458.763s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Back in May of 2017, what was presented here before the city of Medford was a new, what they call a base,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3467.498s">[Robert Penta]</a>: rate of 861 per household.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3470.979s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then the different charge would be for the commercial district folks here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3478.622s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then one of the arguments was that it would raise $1 million a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3483.384s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That was approximately 4% of what the city's budget was at that point in time required for the water and sewer services in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3491.807s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Subsequent to that, it's gone on for the last three years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3496.0s">[Robert Penta]</a>: now coming into its fourth fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3498.821s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I believe a response that was sent back to the city, you folks, pursuant to a request from one of your colleagues, was a breakdown of how much money each and every one of the last three fiscal years amounted to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3513.945s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Inclusive of that amount, again, was the term of $1 million to be used per year, but they never reached the $1 million per year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3524.563s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What was reached was $2,585,362.66 as compared to the $3 million that was allegedly stated that the city would gain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3538.411s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's a difference of $414,637.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3539.612s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So where do we go with that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3544.875s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where we go with that, the argument was that that would be used to supplement water and sewer for whatever needs might be if something were to come up<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3554.937s">[Robert Penta]</a>: also to subsidize the water and sewer department in case of something that's anticipated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3561.501s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In the letter that came back, it indicated here that the universal connectivity fee is an infrastructure recovery charge to be hooked into and maintained in the water and sewer system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3574.349s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The fixed base connectivity fee is estimated at $1 million per year to help stabilize revenues in this place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3584.439s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That response also indicated that that money goes to your water and sewer account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3590.161s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There is no breakdown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3592.182s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There is no breakdown to the charges, commercial or residential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3597.084s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There is no breakdown also as to how and where that money has been spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3602.127s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And there is no program that is set up presently that tells you what that money can be used for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3608.149s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So right now, all it's done has been included into your water and sewer account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3612.957s">[Robert Penta]</a>: One of the misnomers to this whole project, when sold back in 2017, was in case there is a, in case, that's the word, in case there is a deficit in either the water or sewer account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3625.904s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In the years 2016 and 17, there were deficits on the sewer side, not the water side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3632.428s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But each and every year, when the water and sewer budget is estimated, it's estimated on what the work is going to be here in the city of Medford, and also,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3640.852s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The water and the sewer rates that you get from the MWRA, those rates come in ahead of time, not after a budget is made and set.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3648.896s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's another misnomer as it relates to the full program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3652.118s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So approximately right now, you're sitting on $2,585,000 of base rate fees or charges, whatever the term you want to use, that has come from the Mr. and Mrs. Metro taxpayer has been put into the general revenues of your water and sewer account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3671.14s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That ladies and gentlemen is not the proper accounting practices and procedures because in your own water and sewer account, you have to have it broken down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3681.064s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have it broken down by employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3683.185s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have it broken down by cost of material.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3685.586s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have it broken down by the named individuals in the trucks and everything else that goes along with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3691.309s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My suggestion to you folks would be simply this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3695.231s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can't put a fee on somebody or a charge<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3698.987s">[Robert Penta]</a>: without knowing what you're charging them for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3702.228s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3703.429s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If that's the case, you should have just raised the water and sewer account by the approximate 4% that you think it was going to do to offset it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3711.031s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if you're sitting on a surplus of approximately $7 million or thereabouts in your water and sewer enterprise account, and you're sitting on approximately having already raised $2.5 million, but you still don't know how it was spent, where it was gonna go,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3727.116s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where is the projected projects that are supposed to come?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3730.238s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It doesn't make any sense because right now, what it's saying is it's a water and sewage charge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3735.881s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was to services in case something were to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3740.984s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The original proposal back in 2017 was the charge for the water meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3746.607s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that was the charge that was going to be placed on each and every residential person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3751.27s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So we know right now that that charge every single time, once it comes out,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3756.162s">[Robert Penta]</a>: is not for the meter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3757.642s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But unfortunately, for accounting purposes, because you can't figure it out, in this city, in the accounting department, there is nothing to be found that'll tell you how and where that money was spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3769.145s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you can find it in water and sewer, in their particular budgets, independently separated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3774.806s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My suggestion would be to you, that you have a budget coming up this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3779.067s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would hope that maybe somebody would make a request and ask the question, because it doesn't make any sense<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3784.759s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that the response that came back from the finance director, we don't keep an accounting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3789.882s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, if you don't keep an accounting, how do you keep an accounting of residential and commercial meters that you have and what you're going to be charged?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3799.367s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How can you allege that you're going to be taking in a million dollars a year when you haven't even got to that figure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3806.171s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Something needs to be said as it relates to these type of budgetary items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3810.813s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Seven weeks ago, I came in here and I think I explained something like seven items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3814.81s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm going to go through them all one at a time, not tonight, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3818.232s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I will go through them all one at a time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3820.374s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because good accounting procedures tells you what comes in has got to go out and how does it go out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3827.579s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've got situations here that you really don't know why should you be charging these people to supplement or augment a water and sewer account that's presently sitting in millions of dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3838.106s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have yet to be told what the cost is going to be for an anticipated construction<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3843.756s">[Robert Penta]</a>: sidewalk, street reconstruction might be because of water and sewer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3848.278s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if you keep taking in these monies from Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer, you're overcharging them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3854.061s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're overcharging them each and every year on this base rate, the speed, whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3859.123s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Point of information, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3904.033s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, while that may be true, there's also, you talk about general accounting practices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3908.295s">[Robert Penta]</a>: General accounting practices does state that if you are going to put a budgetary item on a budget, as you councilors get each and every year, the question needs to be asked, if I'm going to just put $100 million, so to speak, and put it into a line item, and there's no accounting of the money, other than the fact I just put it into an account, what's the purpose of that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3929.019s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you're right, it's an administrative prerogative, but when it came up in May of 2017, it was contentiously argued at this Medford City Council as to why we need this new fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3940.91s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And at that point in time, the argument was for the purposes of the meters, for the accounting of the meters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3947.015s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now it's going into the general revenue, and now we're being told that there is no delineation, there's no explanation, there's no accounting of how that money's being spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3955.202s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if that's the case,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3956.607s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as Councilors, if there's no explanation of how it's being spent, before you used to have the accounting firm of Melanson and Heath, you don't have them anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3964.609s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have them for like 15 years out of New Hampshire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3966.809s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have a new accounting company that comes in here, they're supposed to do an annual audit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3970.73s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That question ought to come up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3972.05s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because if you remember correctly, if you looked at the Melanson and Heath audits, that was one of their concerns on the MWRA, especially in our water and sewer accounts, if you go back and read them, the accounting and the prioritizing how the money is spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3985.946s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This account, or this money, Councilor Knight, there's no accounting with the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3990.329s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It just goes into a general revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4003.38s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As watchdogs of the city's money, over and beyond the administration, the administration can make a proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4008.924s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The bottom line is here with the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4010.325s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You either vote it up or you vote it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4012.187s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you're going to vote it up or you're going to vote it down,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4014.161s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The question is, what are you voting on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4016.222s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if something comes to your attention to be questioned as to why and how, this is where it's going to take place in the Medford City Council Chambers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4038.148s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then I would respectfully suggest, if we follow that train of thought, I would respectfully suggest a freedom of information<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4044.3s">[Robert Penta]</a>: request to the city auditor, asking the city auditor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4050.681s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As to why, Mr. President, why there is no accounting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4056.362s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When you get the money from the MWRA ahead of time, before a budget is made, there's an accounting of how that money is going to be spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4063.964s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4073.166s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Biss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4074.577s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe, Mr. President, a Freedom of Information Act can come from anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4078.579s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if the council does not get it as you got it from the response from the finance person, then you would go to that next group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4086.182s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because again, if you follow what Councilor Neider said, if allegedly it comes from the Water and Soil Commission, it's their call, maybe their call to implement it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4093.805s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But it's your call to decide how and where, if it's going to be spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4097.727s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you guys can ask for an accounting of how the money is being spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4103.81s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4104.807s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're more than happy to answer the questions because it's the finances of our community and you can't keep tagging on to Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer and now not having an answer or an explanation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4484.852s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, just on that matter, just to go back and reflect, Demita's had a lifespan of 10 to 12 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4490.826s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know if it's 13 to 15.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4492.986s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But that's a perfect example, a perfect example of when you have a budget that's coming up from the Department of Public Works, having a projection, for example, on new water meters, that dollar amount in anticipation needs to be in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4506.377s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And while it's into the proposed budget that you folks deliberate over, it's likewise the same type of money that can be deliberated over the base fee for which goes in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4517.406s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You back then, Council March, talked about the retained earnings, but the retained earnings,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4521.781s">[Robert Penta]</a>: has to be something that's certified and qualified by the Department of Revenue and subsequently voted upon by the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4528.587s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So taking all of that into consideration, you're dealing with a multi-million dollar surplus right now in your water and sewer account, and you also have inclusive of that multi-million dollar, you're talking about two and a half million dollars right now that's been collected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4543.781s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So how does that fit into either retained earnings or the water and sewer balance<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4549.425s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is it off by two and a half minute because this is a new dollar amount in there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4585.77s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And in 2016, Mr. President, the deficit was 467,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4587.091s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And in 2017, it was 427,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4587.551s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That was on the SOAR account, but that was offset on the opposite side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4596.793s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Council March is talking about because of the retained earnings of the surplus that was in the water and sewer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4601.516s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All I'm saying, all I'm saying is this account, if it's included in your water and sewer account, it should be accounted for and how it's spent or anticipated to be spent, just like any project that's going to be done in the forthcoming year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4615.767s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And there was also a dollar amount contained in the budget for unanticipated expenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4620.991s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You may have a street that just blows open, a major line that blows open, I don't know, but the money is there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4626.42s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And lastly, let me just say this, Mr. President, each and every year, I don't know, coming into this year, each and every year, there's been approximately a million dollars in surplus that's left over from the prior year's budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4637.769s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So each and every year for the last maybe 10 to 12 years, there's been approximately a million dollars, and that money, which is left over, once it's certified by the Department of Revenue, it's leftover money, can be used for any unanticipated debt deficit that takes place in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4652.761s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But we don't have to do it because you've got surpluses,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4655.819s">[Robert Penta]</a>: in the water and sewer enterprise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4658.501s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4663.583s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4665.584s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Oh, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2970.61s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Do you have to leave the mask on or can I take it off?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2976.834s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2978.175s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Marksley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2979.155s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2979.616s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know if you can hear me, if it makes it any clearer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2982.658s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What Councilor Marksley has alluded to has brought me into this issue of public accounting as to what took place as it related to this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2992.09s">[Robert Penta]</a>: connectivity fee, that's what it was called.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2994.373s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So it was implemented in August of 2017, and for the last three years, it has brought in in excess of $3 million to the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3003.872s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And having that at $3 million and not knowing how and what it's been used for, and if it was going to be an adjunct to the water and sewer system here in the city of Medford, then so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3014.954s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We always get in advance from the MWRA their projected assessment as to what the city is going to be charged for water and sewer charges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3024.136s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that is built in your annual budget each and every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3027.357s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And each and every year since then, the projection that this could be possibly used for a deficit has never happened because we're still dealing with the surplus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3036.084s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I think what Councilman Marks is alluding to is the fact that, you know, if you've collected $3 million, what have you used it for, number one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3044.47s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What do you have projected for its use?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3047.072s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What is the cost for it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3048.893s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And more importantly, if it is separate from water and sewer, so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3053.196s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As we know that you can't take the money from water and sewer because that's considered to be retained earnings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3057.88s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the only way you can get through retained earnings is to the Department of Revenue to get a waiver and 90% of the time that they will give it to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3065.287s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But this is something that has led me after the resolution went on, if you can just bear with me, to other things that unfortunately the council and the public have not been apprised of and brought forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3077.597s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This base fee charge at a minimum of $51.66 annually, that's on the house side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3082.405s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know what the commercial side would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3084.489s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if in fact it's bringing in approximately a million dollars a year, so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3090.143s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you look at your most recent tax bill here in the city of Medford, which is for the third quarter, they implemented a new system with a new vendor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3098.706s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the new vendor has really got this bill basically messed up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3101.867s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's going to be changed because they made a big mistake on it, especially when it gets to the tax itself and it talks about your CPA tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3110.423s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you think about what's going on, and if you think about the taxes here that are going on here in the city of Medford, what can we do to some degree to help the Medford taxpayer as to what's going on and everything that's going on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3123.413s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So what I would like to just introduce to you is something for you to think about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3128.437s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When you look at your water and sewer tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3143.901s">[Robert Penta]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3144.422s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you can look at your water and sewer bill, and if you can look at your tax bill, I'd like to introduce something for the council entertainers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3150.626s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's called a deadline discount program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3154.79s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And a deadline and discount program, which is implemented in a lot of states and a lot of counties, that the month that you get the bill, your tax bill, for example, you get your tax bill in November, and I believe it's due February 1st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3169.181s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The next one is February 1st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3171.042s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if you pay it on the month that you receive it, there's a 4% discount on your bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3176.043s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The next month, which would be January, there would be a 3% discount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3180.944s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the city in itself would be getting its money quicker.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3184.125s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And at the same time, the taxpayer would be getting a break as it relates to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3188.806s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Same thing as it relates to your water and sewer bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3191.306s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you get your water and sewer bill, it's usually six or seven weeks out before you pay it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3196.247s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the month that you get it, or the month before, you get a 4% discount if you pay for it ahead of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3201.368s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a thought, but it does work because it gets the city money quicker before you get it quicker.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3207.052s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Pinellas County in Florida, one of many counties, have implemented that and they've shown a marketable increase, a marketable increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3215.271s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Another thing, Mr. President, when we talk about the city's unfunded liability, for which this council, I can go back to 2014, Resolution 214725 was offered by myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3227.906s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that particular resolution asked that on an annual basis, the city of Metra take out of its free cash a minimum<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3234.094s">[Robert Penta]</a>: of $500,000 toward then in fund liability of $29 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3239.976s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I have no idea what the unfunded liability is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3242.316s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I don't think this council has any idea of what the balance is and how much each and every year has been taken out of the budget for the purposes of getting to that unfunded liability, which has to be paid by 2029.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3255.54s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Another thing for which the taxpayers and the council should be aware of waste management.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3261.688s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I don't know if you guys are aware of it, but in March of 2014, then Mayor McGlynn signed an extension, a three-year extension to the waste management contract in the City of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3273.652s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that three-year extension went as follows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3276.353s">[Robert Penta]</a>: For the first year, the City of Medford would get $300,000 in cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3279.734s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The second year, they would get $100,000 more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3281.475s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's $400,000 from 2014 going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3282.435s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the catch to the whole thing was as follows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3291.705s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The amendment was, if you remember correctly, for those who did serve back then, recycling was an issue here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3300.362s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And at that point in time, when the contract was signed, we were at 11%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3304.638s">[Robert Penta]</a>: At some point in time, the city worked itself up to a 29% inventory of recycling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3311.601s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But as a result of the city signing off on a three-year extension, what took place there was that the city of Medford allowed waste management, allowed waste management to increase our cost of recycling on an annual basis projected at<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3330.978s">[Robert Penta]</a>: $85 per ton, and then it would set itself on an annual basis increase, according to the city of Boston, beginning on July 1st, 2015.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3341.082s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's almost six months, that's almost a good year after the contract was signed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3345.386s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as a result of that, each and every year, the city of Medford has been being charged more for recycling than they had been according to the original agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3354.596s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So for $300,000, $400,000 that the city got paid up front, the cost of recycling has gone forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3362.103s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And once this contract ends in the year 2023, yeah 2023, all the recycling bins, all the recycling bins that the people have in this city will come under the control of the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3373.833s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They'll own it and not waste management.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3376.536s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Another thing that I believe, Mr. President, needs to really be discussed is the CPA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3381.44s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Once again, taxpayers on an annual basis are at a cost of approximately $103, according to your household, in the value of your home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3390.427s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, the CPA, as we all know, five years are up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3394.93s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Any time after five years, according to the law, as it's written, that question can go back on the ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3401.094s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I would strongly suggest that this council put that question back on the ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3405.197s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because when it was first elected in 2015, 1,200 people did not vote on the question because it was on the backside of the ballot, and they didn't know that the question was there to be asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3419.147s">[Robert Penta]</a>: $103, think about that, annually for CPA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3422.089s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then you think about the $51 and the connectivity fee, and you put that together with maybe the discounts on paying for your taxes, it would be a great help to the city of Medford and to the taxpayers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3432.736s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Also, Mr. President,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3435.025s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Cable costs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3436.065s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Our cable bills from the residents of this community keep going up each and every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3441.087s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They just went up again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3442.848s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But they also have a 5% franchise fee in that cable bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3447.529s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You folks have not got an update on what that increase has brought to the city of Medford and where that money has gone, at least for the last four or five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3456.072s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I know that's something that Councilor Marks had brought up before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3459.373s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then we get to the parking issues, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3474.633s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This presented itself, Mr. President, onto other issues which could be beneficial to the taxpayers, and it would be a public accounting so people could become aware of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3482.655s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Councilor Penta?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3491.977s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, we're almost done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3493.017s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Do you mind if I can just figure it out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3494.437s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because it's unfortunate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3495.818s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know something?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3496.678s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're supposed to seize the moment as the moment is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3499.138s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And we're talking about the people of our community, what they have to pay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3503.039s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Also, at the same time, if we can offer them a benefit, and at the same time, the City gets a benefit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3507.643s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a matter of being creative and looking at what you have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3510.746s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Parking information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3511.746s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You, Mr. President, you have asked on numerous occasions, numerous occasions for a report on how many tickets have been issued, how many have been abated, how much money has been collected, and how much has been given to the City of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3523.496s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Excuse me, none of you can do that because it's never been presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3526.699s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what about the $50,000 that was supposed to go to each and every square here in the City of Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3532.38s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3533.46s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The accounting for the squares hasn't come under any control as to what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3538.741s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And lastly, Mr. President, if we all remember at the inaugural, we were told that seniors in this city would not have to pay any more to park in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3546.943s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That still hasn't come to fruition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3549.044s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's unfair, because you can't make a promise like that and not keep it, because that's what people look at, what your responsibilities are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3557.346s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I say this tonight, Mr. President, as I told you before, taxes pay for what makes this city run.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3563.328s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And at the same time, the city has a responsibility back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3565.67s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if it can be a two hand, shaken hands compromise, why not?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3571.057s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Discounts to your water and sewer bill, discount to your cable bills, finding out where that money went.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3577.301s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And let's get back to the original thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3578.802s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The connectivity fee that was supposed to be helpful here to the city of Medford, you've never had a report where it's going, how much it's brought in, what projects, if anything, and how much it's gonna cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3589.408s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And why should that be considered an adjunct to the Water and Sewer Commission money, when in fact, if you can't project your budget in the future,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3597.453s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Like you're supposed to, and you get your water and sewer estimate ahead of time from the MWRA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3603.083s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We should not be thinking about a deficit when, again, you're just taking more money from the taxpayer without giving them the reason why you took it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3610.389s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'd be more than happy to answer any questions, but I would hope that one of you, someone, even would get into the idea of showing and having some kind of a discount in advance for people who pay their taxes and for people who pay their water and sewer bills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3624.659s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's out there, it's been a proven fact, and it does work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3627.582s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it'd be a great handshake between taxpayers and the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3630.844s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Paeta.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3634.426s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'd be more than happy to answer any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3638.628s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3795.796s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3796.997s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, before you call the roll, one quick thing as a notation on the tax bills that come out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3802.279s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You'll notice it says police, fire, and library.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3805.68s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It says 10, 25, 30, whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3808.461s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Whoever checks that, when those bills come out every quarter, I think it would be informative to have next to each one of those items how much money has been donated so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3819.676s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because that would give either an incentive or not for somebody to make a contribution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3823.281s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3868.902s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On the bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3869.422s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay, under each item it'll tell you, they can put in parentheses, that would designate how much money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3914.989s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4805.815s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Summit Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4807.216s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, I want to go back to something that I had said earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4810.318s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would like the council to entertain what they call a deadline and discount program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4815.442s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This would relate itself to your water bills and also to your taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4820.807s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as I said before, it is well practiced in some states and some cities and towns where<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4828.112s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On the month that you receive, for example, your tax bill, if you pay it that month, you get a 4% discount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4834.174s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you pay it the next month before the bill is due, you get a 3% discount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4838.556s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Or you wait till the very last day and pay it like a lot of people do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4842.178s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Same thing with the water bills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4843.398s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The water bills doesn't have as much of a leeway time between the tax bills when they come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4848.14s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But in the month that you receive the bill, it's usually halfway through the month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4851.441s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you pay it that month, it's a 4% discount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4854.202s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it works well because it's a handshake between the cities and the taxpayers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4858.343s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if the taxpayer is looking for a little bit of a break, there it is right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4862.204s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you pay your bill ahead of time, you get a discount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4864.625s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And at the same time, the city gets its money to use at a quicker rate for whatever purpose it has.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4870.167s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4871.007s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4872.467s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And there's no loss to either side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4874.228s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it's a benefit to either side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4875.889s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And at the same time,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4877.509s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What you're doing is you're telling the taxpayers, you're basically thinking out for them the best way you can, and you're thinking out for the city the best way you can, because you're giving us the money quicker than we would have gotten if we had to wait almost eight weeks for you to pay your tax bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4891.9s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I would hope someone on the council would entertain it, present it before a committee of the whole for the purposes of discussing it, and moving forward with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4900.103s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4902.424s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It works in other cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4903.445s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It works in other states and other cities and towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4905.905s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as I told you earlier, it's just a way of saying to the taxpayers, we're hearing what you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4914.149s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Everybody's got these problems today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4916.21s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We want to help you out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4918.067s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the second thing on the citizen participation, I just don't understand why tax seniors have to pay that once a year $25 tax to park in the city when we were told in January inauguration that the seniors would be able to park for nothing in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4933.387s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That still hasn't happened yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4934.689s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4936.311s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a promise that should have been kept, that needs to be kept, and it's just, once again, it's, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4942.895s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know how the city's operating lately, but all I can tell you is this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4945.877s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've got to look for creative ways to keep the people's interest, and at the same time, to keep your own interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4953.022s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what I presented here tonight, I think, is a pretty good handshake with the taxpayers and with the city of Medford as well, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4961.959s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Be more than happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4963.38s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When we talk about money here in the city of Medford, you talk about how the city is going to function.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4970.585s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the city can only function when the taxpayers are willing to pay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4973.847s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And sometimes people become delinquent in paying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4976.349s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if they become delinquent, they can't pay it because they don't have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4979.291s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if those people that do have it want to relinquish some of their money quicker,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4983.774s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and get a discount for doing it, it helps the city because they get the money quicker.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4987.997s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the last thing I want to say, Mr. President, I think it really needs to entertain itself that the CPA, which is now five years has come and gone, should be looked at about presenting itself on the ballot this November coming in 2021 for the purposes of whether you're going to use it again and re-up it and what have you, because that's what the law says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5005.57s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm not advocating for it or against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5007.292s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What I'm advocating is that the five years are up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5010.195s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The sunset legislation is now in effect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5012.938s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you don't do nothing, it's just going to stay there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5016.261s">[Robert Penta]</a>: 1,200 people in 2015 did not vote on that question because it was on the opposite side of the ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5022.348s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They weren't aware it was there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5024.17s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So we really have no idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5026.172s">[Robert Penta]</a>: whether it would have passed or it didn't pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5028.474s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This time, I think it would be incumbent if the question goes on the ballot, it's there, and the taxpayers make their decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5034.879s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what it's about, the taxpayers' use of their money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5037.521s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'd be more than happy to answer any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5041.625s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Penta.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5042.686s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5157.829s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5158.569s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5167.819s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5169.443s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Relative to Councilor Bears' comment, it doesn't make any difference whether it's in-state or out-of-state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5173.986s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's how a city sets its tax rate and how it makes its collections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5178.329s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All I'm making reference to the fact that it works in other states.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5181.852s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5182.893s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe there's a few cities and towns in Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5185.735s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not my call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5186.876s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's only an offering to be made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5188.677s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if it works, as Councilor Marks has alluded to, how can it not work if you're getting your money quicker and you're having a discount paying it ahead of time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5196.683s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's all I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5197.644s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=409.898s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Good evening, my name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, and a former member of the August body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=415.92s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I come here tonight<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=417.987s">[Robert Penta]</a>: To make some comments on issues that I feel are important as it relates to this upcoming budget, from what I understand this administration, and I know the Chief of Staff is here, he can reflect upon the fact that you guys and Lady are going to get an early budget this year, earlier than normal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=435.088s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If that's true, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=436.529s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is it true?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=437.628s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So he says we hope so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=438.768s">[Robert Penta]</a>: With that being said, and with two new Councilors on the board, I would just like to reflect upon a couple of things as it relates to what really has not been addressed for the past few months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=449.69s">[Robert Penta]</a>: First of all, going back to last year at some point in time regarding the Lawrence Memorial Hospital, we never got a report back from the auditor's office as it relates to the outpatient surgical offices that are going to be housed<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=465.453s">[Robert Penta]</a>: in the old Lawrence Memorial Hospital as part of an addendum to the 16,000 square foot building that the Lawrence Memorial Hospital is going to have their surgical center at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=475.719s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And with that being said, again, it's just out there floating around not knowing what's going to happen because they haven't made a decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=483.203s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Second of all, it's the taxing of the nonprofit funeral portion<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=488.206s">[Robert Penta]</a>: of the operation at the Gaffey Funeral Home, which houses the Islamic Cultural Center here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=495.068s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And where they're going to be running a funeral business out of that center, once again, it presents itself as a for-profit business within the non-profit structure itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=506.011s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Again, no answers come back on that as of yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=509.192s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And these are issues that I think need to be discussed and resolved before or at least during your budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=515.834s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Also, let's go back to something that Councilor Caraviello, when he first came on to the Council, talked about, the disrepair of the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=524.222s">[Robert Penta]</a>: At that point in time, Councilor Caraviello indicated during his first term, it was $1.2 million of school repairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=530.908s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're now in excess of $1.5 million of school repairs, and we're getting ourselves right into the same position, I shouldn't say ourselves, the city is getting itself into this position<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=541.758s">[Robert Penta]</a>: of why we had to build new schools in the first place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=544.059s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If the upkeep is not going to be taking place, there is something wrong with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=549.401s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The building of a new police station, contained within the building of the new police station, it's 5,000 square feet less than what was asked for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=557.965s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There is no police firing range that is for qualification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=563.208s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But more importantly, the sad part about the whole thing, no police vehicle is going to be able to be housed internally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=568.91s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're all going to be outside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=571.365s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And by doing that, all you're doing is leaving all your public service vehicles open to the elements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=577.03s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if there's a snowstorm or whatever it might be, every police officer's gonna have to go out there and take the snow off it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=582.034s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you try to explain that to the people of this community and you tell them that you're spending close to $20 million for a new police station, but you have no place to house or at least care for your police cruisers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=594.656s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A very important issue that seems to be lost in the weeds is the, at present, if not more, a $29 million unfunded pension liability that needs to be paid by 2029.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=606.781s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That is yet to be discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=610.322s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Also, what needs to be addressed right now also is a citywide<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=616.474s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's called the Citywide Home Water Meter Battery Replacement Program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=621.317s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now for those of you that have a house and you know when you get your water and sewer bill, the system was put in well over 10 years ago with meters that were only good for 10 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=631.523s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The 10 years have come and gone, that's a cost factor and that's a replacement that needs to take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=637.446s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We still have yet to receive a cost projection for a new fire station as to where it will be, when it will be, and what it will cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=646.17s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There is no projections out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=648.451s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And still outstanding is the new training tower that was promised it would be built before the old one was taken down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=657.274s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, the old one has been taken down, and now nothing has been put up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=662.116s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And in fact, it does affect, in the city of Medford, your home insurance rates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=667.213s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's no financial outline as to how the city's annual free cash should be prioritized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=673.275s">[Robert Penta]</a>: For the new councils coming on board, for the last few many years, it's almost a million dollars each and every year the city of Medford has left over, it just goes into free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=682.278s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So that presents itself with one or two arguments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=684.399s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Number one, the budget is either not accurate, or number two, that million dollars is maybe not correct when the budget is being voted upon at the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=694.463s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So therefore,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=697.506s">[Robert Penta]</a>: To me, it makes very good sense because a lot of cities and towns do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=701.488s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You folks pass a budget in May or June, let's call it June, that should be the time you set your tax rate, not six months later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=709.672s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if you do that, you're working on an actual annual budget that reflects upon that vote that took place in June that represents itself to each and every dollar itemized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=722.077s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Also, a public works five-year projection program that covers our streets, our sidewalks, our tree stumps, our equipment, our water repairs issues, and cemetery, as well as all personnel that's gonna be needed to address that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=737.109s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That would be a great program to have because number one, we're already understaffed and we're hiring immediately just two more people to work in the highway department that just basically on a daily basis is so understaffed and on demand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=749.895s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Lastly, for the purposes of at least this portion of the discussion, two points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=756.477s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I know Councilor Caraviello once again has asked for this and Councilor Marks, you've asked for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=760.598s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You should get a five-year financial recap from Park Medford on all the receipts taken in and what has been given to the City of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=768.459s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I guarantee none of you have received anything from Park Medford as it relates to that financial responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=775.501s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And lastly, Councilor Marks, you brought this up, yet to be determined<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=779.182s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where and for what reasons has the $500,000 from Tufts University been accounted for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=785.185s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You still don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=786.245s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We still don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=788.186s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now moving over to the housing issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=791.345s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And here's an issue right now that's in the forefront of everything as to what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=796.447s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So let's just mention a few little things that are going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=800.028s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Right now what we have on the books are 185 units that are coming online after Wendy's on Middlesex Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=807.19s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have 300 plus units opposite the Wellington Station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=811.191s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have a proposed 400 Chapter 40B units next to the Middlesex Courthouse on Mystic Valley Parkway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=818.553s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And looking at the smaller neighborhood issue that took place on Forest Street, where a private developer wanted to maximize a single-family residence to a multi-family use zone, that caused a tremendous amount of consultation not only to the neighborhood, but the Medford Historical Commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=836.195s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Going back, you go to 61 Toro Street, where you had an old magnificent home over there for which Tufts University was involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=843.243s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And they sort of like wanted to take advantage of the property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=846.026s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But through the neighborhood pushing back, that didn't take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=850.475s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Right now, as of tomorrow night, you're going to have before the Board of Appeals, where the old Titan gas station is on Boston Avenue and Harvard Street, a condominium proposed development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=861.519s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then you have rumored development of a new condos behind the Middlesex Avenue Mall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=867.522s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Once again, a rumored development of 30 plus condos on South Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=872.784s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And a rumored Boston Avenue multi-housing development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=878.123s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then, at the end of last summer, 500 multi-use development was proposed by Combined Properties of Malden.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=887.529s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And after a large community opposition, led by then City Councilor and now Mayor, Lungo-Koehn, as well as Gene Nuzzo and Cheryl Rodriguez, the project was forced to be scrapped by the developer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=904.521s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, some six months later,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=907.52s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This same company, Combined Properties, is now proposing a 37, 378 residential unit, and the application for approval is coming along under a Chapter 40B proposal, entirely different than what they originally had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=924.773s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The real wake-up call to this whole issue right now on housing here in the City of Medford should have taken place at 61 Locust Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=932.179s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The massive development that is opposite Wegmans right now, which was originally scheduled for over 500 units, and they've culled it down to 345.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=942.412s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Neighborhood protests pushed it back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=945.033s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But as in any big business development, what did they do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=949.075s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They went into the neighbors that were pushing back and they bought every single home over there for them to at least come back with $345,000 and still make the money that they're going to be made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=960.103s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As I said some years ago, and as I said during this past campaign, the City of Medford needs to embark on a moratorium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=967.685s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A moratorium on its zoning, and more importantly, a complete review of its zoning here in the City of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=975.207s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the reason why the moratorium would work<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=978.311s">[Robert Penta]</a>: is because our zoning has not been reviewed for a multitude of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=982.653s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you're saying to any proposed developer that comes in, I will propose this affordable housing, which is not the same as a Chapter 40B, because remember, affordable housing is something that's compensated in part or given great latitude by state laws, whereas a Chapter 40B is a private independent entity coming in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1004.523s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So sure, they'll give you their affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1007.284s">[Robert Penta]</a>: but they'll back in the cost on the remaining units that are in the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1011.186s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So how does that qualify and justify for an affordable housing process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1015.489s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1016.95s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But also, you should be looking into what they call a growth management proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1023.934s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the reason why I say that is because we have right here in our own city, a sister city, it's called Malden, Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1033.829s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And in 2015, they put a question on the ballot, and their ballot question revolved around what you have been talking about, Councilor Falco, the Malden Hospital, what we're going to do with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1045.737s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The second thing is the Community Preservation Act, what are we gonna do with that as far as open space?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1050.98s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And their third question was the moratorium on high-density, multi-level development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1057.564s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It won by 71% of the vote, and they had a moratorium,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1063.834s">[Robert Penta]</a>: proposal that passed and it went from January of 2016 to December of 2017.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1068.516s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now incorporated into that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1076.522s">[Robert Penta]</a>: was the density of the immediate neighborhood taken into consideration, the height, the number of units, as well as the zoning exemptions that were being challenged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1087.07s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as a result of that, they have now, I think if you go to them all, then you can be able to see, if you look at their development office, I don't know if they call it Office of Community Development, they do have a serious situation where they had developers just coming in all over the place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1102.765s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Medford has a serious problem in having a workable business community, a business development community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1110.249s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Approximately 10.2% of the business in this community is commercial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1115.171s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Who bears the rest of that brunt?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1117.172s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's the residential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1118.553s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I know every time when you folks turn around and do your budget, you talk about a residential factor making it the highest or the lowest or whatever it might be, you're still putting the burden<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1127.998s">[Robert Penta]</a>: on the taxpayer who owns his residential home, and you're not taking the exemption for the out-of-state person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1133.761s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So, with that being said, and if we continue to go on this road, or this, how can you say, this road, so to speak, of not increasing our commercial base, all you're going to do is just going to be commercial, I mean, raising in the future your residential rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1148.628s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, after what took place in Malden, and after what took place after that, we can switch ourselves over to the city of,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1161.081s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You want somebody else to talk?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1164.744s">[Robert Penta]</a>: OK, well, I'm on my last page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1166.526s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm on my last page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1168.767s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So after Malden, beside Malden, in 2015, the city of Revere, and again in 2018, put that question of a moratorium, high density, multi-use positions over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1179.916s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And their situation over there revolved itself around large scale buildings, traffic, public safety, schools, and roads were going to be at issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1188.163s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the claims that Revere was not growing geographically, but rather becoming more dense without any economic development is just like what's going on right here in our city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1200.088s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And with that being said, that the challenge for affordable housing in Chapter 40B as we speak today,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1205.43s">[Robert Penta]</a>: would be the luxury of using our at-present zoning laws and skirt around the real issue of reasonably priced housing and rental.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1214.596s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There are two or three companies in the United States that take into effect low-moderate housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1221.3s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Veterans<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1223.098s">[Robert Penta]</a>: middle-income people, but not high-end middle-income people, middle-income people, and that's a determination by a professional.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1229.963s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We don't have that expertise over here, and I know on the ballot here tonight, on our agenda, there's a question regarding Chapter 40B, but if you really look at just Chapter 40B, and you realize that developer is not there to lose money, and he's putting housing in a densely populated area, you're violating all the reasoning of why a neighborhood should be a neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1253.438s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as a result of that, moratoriums does not have to go on the ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1257.602s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A moratorium can be placed by this council, by this mayor, or jointly together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1262.266s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And recognizing the fact, and recognizing the fact, we are a city just as running, allowing housing to be any place and everywhere at any time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1270.152s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And because of that, that's not good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1272.054s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's not healthy for the neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1274.136s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As I said before a long time ago, development for the sake of development isn't the best thing that can happen in this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1279.58s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have schools, we have public safety, we have public works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1282.822s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have a whole host of issues that taxpayers have to increasingly pay for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1287.005s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And our best example of that is when they talked about stations landing, that they said at that point in time, that was going to lower our tax rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1293.909s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, the tax rate has never gone down once since station landing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1297.271s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As a matter of fact, it just continuously goes up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1300.794s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'd be more than happy to answer any questions, but I just think it's important to have brought this up, especially for our two new councils, but more importantly for all seven of you, because this administration and you as a new council needs to address issues that basically address these matters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1318.0s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They haven't been addressed, and they need to be addressed, and you just can't sit here and say, okay, we'll get to it someday, because someday has already come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1327.983s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So with that being said, Mr. President,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1331.362s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Larry, could you, I made copies of my comments for all of your Councilors, so in case you missed anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1341.869s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The part that I appreciated the most when I served on this board for 36 years was the fact that I was willing to hear opposite viewpoints.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1351.193s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But when it comes to finances, two and two equals four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1355.534s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And when it comes to neighborhoods, the people who live in the neighborhood should come first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1360.056s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Not out-of-towners, not developers who want to come in there and make a whole bunch of money and then leave us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1365.958s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Perfect example is Lumineer on Locust Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1369.139s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They built the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1370.7s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They said they were going to stay there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1372.201s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They went to the Board of Appeals to get what they had to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1374.762s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And one year later, they sold off the building and made $62 million at the expense of the Medford taxpayer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1382.327s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So with that being said, Mr. President, I thank you for listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1384.868s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if there's any questions, I'd be more than happy to answer them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1395.594s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Can I ask a question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3509.89s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3517.376s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert Penta, 0 Summit Road, Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3520.078s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm really getting confused on this whole issue right now, because I thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3529.065s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let me just ask this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3530.526s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let me ask just one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3532.127s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And to me, this is where I would be going with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3535.45s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm trying to understand, you're telling me that don't raise the value of land.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3540.412s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you don't raise the value of land, you'll have a better neighborhood or a better atmosphere, so to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3546.174s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So with that being taken, taking place, what you're saying is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3550.936s">[Robert Penta]</a>: ignore zoning because zoning is a big reason why land values go up and if you are going to take out the free competitive spirit of Somebody buying a piece of property and doing what he wants by ignoring the zoning laws that absolutely exist at the present time whether it be for a chapter 40 B or affordable zoning that flies in the face of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3573.656s">[Robert Penta]</a>: of what the petition is all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3575.978s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think what Dr. Starello is basically trying to say, all you're doing is moving the debt from today till tomorrow, and when tomorrow comes, whether it's two today or 10 or 12 or 14, what are you dealing with?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3587.469s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Somebody's gonna wind up paying for it, but in the meantime, it's a cost factor that's being reflected upon everyday taxpayer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3594.014s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So when somebody says that the value of land, don't put it on the value of land,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3599.079s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That seems to be the intrinsic value of how developers seem to come into a community, see the value.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3605.281s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They don't care about the location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3606.821s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They don't care about what the density is going to do with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3609.842s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's your zoning that's gonna predicate the value of land and its use of land and neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3615.804s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's how I read what Councilor Morell just offered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3619.225s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4953.551s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Barpenta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4955.972s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So this is going to reflect back on some of the comments that I made a little bit earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4960.033s">[Robert Penta]</a>: First of all, the City of Medford is a member of the Massachusetts Municipal Association, and they have individuals who are very professional in the housing portion of what we're talking about here right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4971.397s">[Robert Penta]</a>: To go out and hire a private consultant that pushes and advocates for Chapter 40B, I don't think would be a very wise idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4980.424s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Oh, against the 40B.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4981.825s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I thought you said... I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4984.927s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, you may not have to do that because if the Office of Community Development gets itself redesigned, hopefully you would have somebody up there who would understand what the process is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4992.771s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have to understand something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4994.152s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's a difference between Chapter 40B, which does come under a few Massachusetts housing management departments, as compared to affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5004.337s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Affordable housing is usually a private,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5007.779s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But working with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, who to some degree sets some standards up there as it relates to not only affordability, which has to be, but the permanent and perpetuity of having the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5020.091s">[Robert Penta]</a>: the reduced cost unit, whether it be the rental or whether it be the housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5025.694s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Chapter 40B is made for a private developer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5029.536s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He'll come in there and say in the city of Medford, well, you've got to get between, your income level has to be 80% of the medium income in the area that you're applying to put the housing in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5038.642s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if that be the case, you know, we can do that or we'll put 100 units up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5044.456s">[Robert Penta]</a>: 25, 2025, whatever the number's gonna turn out to be, will be affordable, and we'll just raise the cost on the other end of the units.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5050.54s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So what did you wind up getting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5052.341s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You really didn't complete anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5055.683s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Me personally, my suggestion would be that the city goes into a complete moratorium on any and all development to take place, because you don't have anything right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5064.228s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have a Chapter 40B person who can come in, who just came in right now on Mystic Avenue,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5069.591s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and will bypass your height restrictions and other zoning requirements because that's what 40B is allowed to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5075.919s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you read chapter 69 of chapter 49, excuse me, of chapter 40B, that's what they'll tell you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5084.229s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They can come in and they detour and they go around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5086.972s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I know you guys, Councilor Knight and Councilor Scarpelli, have talked about over the last two or three years, zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5092.296s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So maybe you should hire a zoning consultant right now to figure out how you bring up an update of a 40-year-old zoning that you have here in the city of Medford because every Chapter 40B that comes in here will bypass upstairs and they'll get around it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5105.606s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's the privilege that you have for being a Chapter 40B participant, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5110.589s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if you want to have a Chapter 40B<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5113.231s">[Robert Penta]</a>: be participant that works with the city, then that's what you need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5116.813s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You need to have someone who goes into the neighborhood and sees where the project is going and how is it going to enhance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5122.417s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not gonna produce a density buster.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5125.699s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what you don't want, and that's what's happening right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5128.281s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Density busting all over the city, because private developers know how to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5132.784s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're efficient at doing it, they make it sound good, and what do you have left?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5137.387s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have all these developments all over the place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5140.797s">[Robert Penta]</a>: schools, police, fire, public works, infrastructure, water and sewer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5147.159s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's all affected by this, all affected by this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5150.44s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And while it might sound good that it looks good, that's what you're paying for in your taxes for which our commercial tax rate can't even handle because it's only a 10%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5160.664s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the burden once again is right back onto the residential taxpayer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5165.025s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it's a great idea to get into the discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5168.442s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if you read this case after case after case where cities and towns are so sorry that they went into Chapter 40B because it did not turn out to be what it was supposed to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5178.185s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the fastest way to correct a Chapter 40B problem is to make sure that your zoning speaks for what you want today and for tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5186.767s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's the financial viability of what a community has to deal with as it relates to a Chapter 40B.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5192.409s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Not affordable housing, it's a Chapter 40B.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5195.029s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're in two entirely different requirements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5197.97s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Point of information, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5254.154s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, if you go to the city of Somerville, they just went through it for a year and a half.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5257.236s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They stopped, they had a moratorium as it relates to that type of development that took place over there because of what was taking place so fast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5266.301s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They did nothing for that period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5268.442s">[Robert Penta]</a>: as it relates to multi-use development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5274.404s">[Robert Penta]</a>: To the best of my, to moratorium, so that means you can't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5277.205s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Another point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5290.871s">[Robert Penta]</a>: One of the things that a Chapter 40B does tell you, if they go before a Board of Appeals, if the Board of Appeals feels, this is the term that they use, and it's not a friendly Chapter 40B, that's the term, friendly, they can shoot that down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5306.196s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, what determines to be friendly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5309.157s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It could be public health, it could be public safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5311.678s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Those are the two biggest issues that you'd have going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5314.879s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Other than being in a residential neighborhood and making it high density,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5318.953s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's a subjective thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5320.194s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's all I can tell you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5322.055s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if you are going to hire somebody, or Office of Community Development is going to employ somebody, consultant or otherwise, that's the first thing I would address, because you have such archaic laws, you can go to the Board of Appeals right now and come in and make a proposal, and you can't shoot it down, because YDB will allow you to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5343.814s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's an interesting concept and the city of Medford really needs to address it because you've gone at a fever pitch over the past many years with all kinds of development and there's no checks and balances to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5358.449s">[Robert Penta]</a>: 61 Locust Street is really the issue that should bring this all to a head.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5362.713s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It should have brought it to a head then when they wanted to put 500 units there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5366.676s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay, and what did they do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5368.499s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The big developer went in there and bought out the neighborhood, bought out every single house in the neighborhood, and they reduced it to 345, which the Board of Appeals allowed, and it managed to put itself through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5391.19s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe that the reason, I believe Councilor, the reason why the city lost is because the neighborhood agreed to the reduction of $345,000 after they all got bought out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5401.379s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So our suit was completely moved at that point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5422.466s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But they felt it had zero standing, but also the then mayor at the time refused to give additional money to go forward with the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5431.493s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You could have appealed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5454.052s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I also believe, Mr. President, when you lost the issue on standing, it was a moot issue, because all the people, the residents, pushed back on the lawsuit, because they all got bought out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5464.315s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the standing for which the council had was not being supported by the neighborhood, which initiated the lawsuit in the first place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5472.076s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the council got originally $20,000 in the beginning to get the case going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2668.477s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2670.351s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Name and address of the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2671.753s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert M. Pentez, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of this party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2675.557s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, the world is in a changing state of times right now, and I think what Councilman Marks has introduced is something that could be epidemic anywhere in this country, but it's not the first time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2685.229s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's been here before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2686.69s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, you as Councilors, you have a 50 percent voice in the school department budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2691.653s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you see something that's not taking place in their budget, for example, under school security, and here's a prime example of what school security is all about, this is the opportunity to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2701.057s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If the school committee knows that the city council is with them and trying to help them, that's a great leadership quality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2707.501s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I don't think anybody in any municipal or state or federal capacity should sit back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2712.043s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you've got something to say that revolves around security,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2714.683s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Say it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2715.003s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what you're getting paid for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2716.423s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what the people expect from you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2718.924s">[Robert Penta]</a>: With that being said, Mr. President, not only do I think it's a good movement, I think it would be wise, as a suggestion being offered to the school committee, that they review their entire policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2730.526s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And now, knowing that they're going to be having a new superintendent as of June or at the end of May or whatever it might be, if not sooner, whatever the situation might be, here's an opportunity to start to clean house on issues that are really of a concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2743.352s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maybe the gun clip said something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2746.053s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the review of the policy is what it's all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2749.533s">[Robert Penta]</a>: People in the building that nobody knows nothing about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2752.234s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think it's a good motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2754.755s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I would hope the council votes approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4471.125s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Pentez, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4474.406s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The stress and anxiety of Clipgate, that's what I call it, Clipgate, has needlessly caused our city an embarrassed showing for collective management when they thought nobody was looking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4485.85s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Dating back to December 28th, when the ammo clip was first found,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4490.832s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A cast of characters have become principal components to the investigation, starting with the cleaning company personnel who first found the clip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4500.034s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have further parties of interest in the school custodian, Mr. Edwards, the principal at the McGlynn School, Mr. Belson, the school superintendent, the resource officer, Medford police officer, Riccati, Mr. McLaughlin, director of building and grounds, Mayor Burke, and school employees who brought this to the attention of Councilor Lungo-Koehn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4521.859s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When Councilor Lungo-Koehn notified the police on Thursday, December 15th, of this concern brought to her attention by school employees, the school building was swept on Tuesday, February 20th, according to news reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4535.225s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thankfully, Breanna Lungo-Koehn and Councilor Marks addressed this matter at their next council meeting with many concerned parents in attendance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4543.889s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This past Thursday, February 22nd,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4546.573s">[Robert Penta]</a>: at the Karen Little Theater at Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4549.434s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Seven days after Breonna Lungelkorn notified police, the mayor called for a school committee meeting wherein hundreds of Medford citizens, teachers, and administrators attended to discuss the matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4561.997s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When Mayor Burke, as chairperson of the school committee, first found out about this matter, and from whom and what did she do, she has yet to disclose that matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4571.714s">[Robert Penta]</a>: While the February 22nd meeting revealed a lot of anger and displeasure as to what the Clipgate incident has caused, it also revealed shortcomings to questions asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4584.843s">[Robert Penta]</a>: One glaring question, and yet to be answered, was, who was the we that decided not to share the info at the outset?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4593.908s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The Medford Police, under the direction of Chief Sacco, is leading the in-house investigation regarding this incident, as he should.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4601.664s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If the Medford police are good enough to investigate a murder, stolen property, drug dealing, and other crimes within their daily jobs, they now don't need to be upstaged by the mayor and her hiring of her close, personal, and financially rewarding political friend, Martha Coakley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4620.247s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mayor Burke, on her own, without any discussion, approval, or vote of record from the school committee, has hired her close personal friend, former Attorney General Martha Coakley, who has contributed $1,000 to Mayor Burke's campaign to do this independent personnel investigation because of this matter as it's reported in the news reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4643.868s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This independent personnel investigation should have no ties nor relationships to any politicians in our cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4652.535s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I ask, where is the transparency to this matter?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4655.898s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Independent means just what it says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4659.02s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Free and devoid from any influence, guidance, or counsel of another or others, nor affiliated with or loyal to no one political party, organization, or voter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4670.767s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Both Mrs. Burke and Mrs. Coakley are both Democrats.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4674.67s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This hiring of Martha Coakley by Mayor Burke is a sole source contract, a contract awarded without competitive bidding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4684.476s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It directs itself to cronyism, particularly in awarding jobs to friends or trusted colleagues in politics between politicians.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4694.375s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This hiring also prevents presents, excuse me, a serious question as to whether Mayor Burke has violated the state ethics law on the chapter 62.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4704.318s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 268A, wherein the law states if a conflict is apparent, or the appearance is a telling sign, then a violation of the law is readily at hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4716.627s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A public employee may not act in a manner that would cause a reasonable person to think that she would show favor toward someone or that she can be improperly influenced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4728.535s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I stand here not to question the ability or the capability<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4733.222s">[Robert Penta]</a>: of Martha Coakley, but rather the concern of a state ethics conflict of interest, as well as to her individual unspecified cost from her very expensive downtown Boston law firm of Foley and Hogue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4748.798s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mayor Burke's relationship with Martha Coakley has been long and financially rewarding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4754.15s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I find it interesting that Mayor Burke is now concerned with having an independent personnel investigation, but where is her outside independent audit of the school department if she is so concerned about righting the ship?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4767.832s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I do not believe we need a very expensive, close, personal, and political friend of the mayor to address Medford's employee personnel policies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4777.495s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Medford is a good city with tons of good people in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4781.156s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let this incident be the thoughtful reminder that when the law is not followed and protocols are not in place, and when city leaders take it upon themselves to make decisions that fly in the face of potential safety and what the law says,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4797.221s">[Robert Penta]</a>: then all involved, no matter who, as this case has demonstrated, shall be held accountable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4804.826s">[Robert Penta]</a>: For the truth only has one consequence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4808.468s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let no cover-up be worse than the crime itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4812.73s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would like to conclude by making a correction to a statement I made last Thursday at the school committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4819.743s">[Robert Penta]</a>: At the conclusion of my commentary and in my haste, I misread what I meant to say, and it was as follows, what I meant to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4828.807s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What happened in Florida was horrific, and hopefully we all have learned something here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4834.269s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The people of Medford want action, and as city officials, you owe it to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4839.411s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, with that being said, Mr. President, again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4843.374s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You folks have been through the whole issue of conflict of interest, whether it be your pay raises or jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4849.616s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is a very serious matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4852.077s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This hiring of Mrs. Coakley out of the Clear Blue Sky, while this incident is going on, I believe does not speak well for the police investigation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4862.041s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't think it speaks well for the Medford Police Department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4864.722s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They can handle their own investigation, and if it turns out to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4867.505s">[Robert Penta]</a>: something on one of their own, they will resolve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4870.128s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If it's something that's resolved here in the building, an employee, it will be resolved internally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4875.435s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if the need is to have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4877.934s">[Robert Penta]</a>: an updated personnel policy that hasn't taken place since this mayor has come into being, well then so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4885.06s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But to hire someone who paid you, strike that, who gave you $1,000 in political contributions, smacks with the theory that this is directly a conflict of interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4897.591s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this is a sole source contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4899.893s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There was no need for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4901.821s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There was no need to go out with no competition, no bidding on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4905.043s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This wasn't a serious emergency that needed to be done and nobody could be contacted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4909.825s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I really think it needs to be reviewed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4912.166s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think the city solicitor needs to review it with you council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4915.067s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would hope someone on the council would ask that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4918.449s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why did the mayor go ahead and do it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4919.649s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The mayor hasn't even notified you fellas and you yet that she's hired Mrs. Coakley for this particular purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4926.578s">[Robert Penta]</a>: to do this investigation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4928.279s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know how much she charges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4929.819s">[Robert Penta]</a>: People say she charges $500 an hour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4932.16s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, how many hours is she going to go for and how long is this going to go on for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4936.022s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The taxpayers of this community need to know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4938.663s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this issue of her being hired should not be disguised because of this ammo gate that's going on here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4946.106s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They are two separate issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4949.227s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the mayor needs to respond and answer that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4952.411s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Was she part of the we that made the decision not to disclose the information, dating back as early as December 28th and bringing it up to February 15th when Councilor Longo-Curran brought this to everybody's attention because of people bringing it to her attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4967.842s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, if you remember closely what the Chief said when the question was asked of him about the picture with the clip with the gun, because I was the one that asked him, where did you get that picture, Chief?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4978.45s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And he says he got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4980.046s">[Robert Penta]</a>: from the Director of Buildings and Grounds, Mr. McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4983.468s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I gave you seven people in the beginning that start this whole thing going that have to be interviewed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4988.25s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Possibly every single elected official probably should be interviewed and asked a question, because maybe some of you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4993.393s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maybe some of you have been told something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4994.954s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4996.115s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you know something?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4996.895s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a very serious incident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4998.776s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Last Thursday night, up at that high school, there were so many people that were so impassioned as to what they were saying that sometimes it just looked like it might have or it could have gotten out of hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5010.32s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But logic and common sense and calmness has to take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5015.043s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We all know now that there is an issue out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5017.585s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We all know that allegedly it was thrown away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5020.666s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We don't know if it was thrown away, if it was misplaced, somebody took it, somebody got rid of it, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5026.41s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The police report, the police investigation will prove that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5029.912s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But while all that's going on, to hire another paid outside consultant, because that person is a political personal friend of the mayor,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5040.195s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My God, come on, folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5041.597s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, there's got to be some checks and balances here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5045.842s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It can't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5046.163s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If it looks like a duck and walks like a duck and smells like a duck, it probably is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5049.647s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Chapter 268A, that's what it says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5052.03s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can't give the appearance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5053.532s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this definitely not only gives the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5056.556s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've got the $1,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5057.697s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've got the contributions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5059.377s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And she's not only contributed to this mayor, she's contributed to other mayors and other people in this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5065.5s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5066.721s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's not being independent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5069.122s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's saying pay to play.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5071.303s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if that's what's going to go on here, then shame on this city and shame on elected officials for allowing this to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5077.026s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I would hope Mrs. Coakley would give a second thought about this and say, well, while it was nice to be asked, I think it would be better for the city of Medford to find someone<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5086.35s">[Robert Penta]</a>: who has absolutely no connections if they really want to do an independent policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5090.596s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You folks are all part of the Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5092.418s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Municipal Association.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5093.419s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They have a huge department in there to review personnel purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5096.964s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You pay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5097.705s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're a paying member on an annual basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5100.148s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You should have gone to them first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5102.393s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But to turn around in this situation and disguise it because of what happened with the ammo clip and go out there and hire a Methodist lawyer from one of the most expensive law firms in Boston, and you don't even know what it's going to cost you, it makes no sense at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5118.5s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would hope one of you somewhere along here puts a request in to have a report as to how and why she was hired, how much is she getting, and if, in fact, this is a conflict of interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5129.285s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5910.783s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5911.724s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let me address the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5912.925s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Zero Summit Road, Barpenta.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5914.647s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Number one,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5916.317s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As outlined in the local press and in the Boston news media, she was hired, Martha Coakley was hired by the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5922.779s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This vote never took place, it was never presented before the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5926.301s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, wait a minute, I'm just telling you, if you can check it out, it was never presented before the, it was never presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5932.143s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was never presented, Rick, before the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5934.384s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's no official vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5939.413s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If it's hearsay, never mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5944.395s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Can I ask you to amend the resolution that reads, well, maybe you don't like it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5950.456s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can leave if you're bored.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5952.777s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maybe you can ask the question that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5955.815s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're concerned about the ethics of it because of the fact of the financial contributions she has made to the mayor, and that in and of itself presents a conflict of interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5966.517s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The appearance of a conflict of interest, that's what 268A says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5973.018s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what we're asking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=6079.932s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=6080.813s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, just as a point of reference, on February 23rd it was written in the Boston Herald and where the mayor is quoted as saying that Martha Coakley is now an employee being hired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4700.656s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Name and address of the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4707.421s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, former member of the Saga's party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4712.095s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm going to piggyback on what Cheryl talked about, but I'm more to the process more than anything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4717.72s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Um, this was a, the September meeting of the board of appeals was continued to the October meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4722.744s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And once the meeting was continued to the October meeting, um, it was noticed out that the some of all Alderman didn't have enough time, um, to prepare what he needed to prepare.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4732.032s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So he wanted to be allowed to speak in the October meeting for which he was, I believe four of members of the council were there, expressed their opinion that the members, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4740.731s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They had received emails and telephone calls regarding folks that weren't notified, did not get the notice, and they just heard about it on this particular night, and they rushed down there to come to this October meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4751.1s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was at the discretion of the chairman of the board, Mr. Carman, who indicated that public comment was closed because the September meeting had come and gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4762.029s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, that's not particularly correct either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4766.613s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The meeting was continued, and when the meeting was continued,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4769.911s">[Robert Penta]</a>: At the time when the chairman asked for a raise of hands, those who might be opposed, and I believe he said, let the record say there were 10, at that point he opened up that meeting for public participation by the raise of the hands, because he noticed it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4784.739s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He also said that they couldn't speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4786.88s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, if you're asking for their participation by raising their hands, but they couldn't speak, you really don't know the reason why they were opposing it, because maybe they would have been convinced<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4797.814s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that they would be far if they wanted to get their particular point across, which unfortunately I never had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4803.641s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So then you go to four particular issues that I think were really prevalent at that particular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4812.17s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The first one was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4814.083s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The zoning on parking spaces, Somerville and Medford are very different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4817.665s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Somerville has 1.0 per parking unit, Medford has 2.1.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4822.127s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No discussion on that at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4824.027s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The next issue was the sun being blocked on the streets that are abutting this particular project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4830.39s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a legitimate concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4831.571s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have the same issue here on High Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4834.738s">[Robert Penta]</a>: when they were building the new condominiums next to St.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4836.639s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Joseph's Church.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4837.779s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And there's legal cases and legal precedent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4840.36s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If someone's sunlight is being blocked by a building, and in this particular case, you're asking for variances to a particular project, which is over and beyond just a normal building, that has legal precedence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4853.563s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Also, they didn't talk about the fact that Cheryl alluded to the facts on this mixed-use piece of property that could be put together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4862.97s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, in the city of Medford, we do not allow for spot zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4866.211s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's one of the arguments that's taking place on Locust Street right now, the argument of a possible spot zoning issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4873.333s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That didn't even have an opportunity for public discussion as it relates to the fact that, you know, is it or isn't it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4879.434s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the mixed use combination of mixed use of commercial and residential, beside not having its opportunity to have a conversation, did not even have its opportunity for the Board of Appeals to say, if we're going to entertain that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4892.037s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's obvious that it's a mixed zone, I mean, it's a spot zone issue, which is in violation of the law or the spirit of, not the spirit, of the Massachusetts general law here in the city of Medford that's promulgated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4903.261s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've got an issue here as it relates to the developer and what he needs to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4907.382s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, Councilor Dello Russo alluded to the fact that the board is not political.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4910.923s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It most certainly is political because all three members of the board are appointed by the mayor of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4915.925s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the request that was just made earlier by Councilor Longo relative to asking the mayor<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4921.493s">[Robert Penta]</a>: to ask the board to let people speak on and beyond, over and beyond, is absolutely on target.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4928.017s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And more importantly, you can say what you want about the prior Board of Appeals when Mr. Arena was the chairperson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4933.421s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He always allowed every single person to speak, never mind once, sometimes twice, because he recognized whether you agreed or disagreed with his decision, if people took the time to be there and have a conversation about the project that's before them, then let them speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4948.411s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that was not the situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4951.093s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I almost had the distinct honor of having the police called on me by the chairperson, because I asked him, and I begged him three separate times, would you please let the people speak?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4959.898s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And he says, no, no, he can't, because the time has already come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4962.759s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We've already had it in September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4964.62s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And through his reckless act, and that's what I call it, reckless, he canceled the whole meeting, which was the last two petitioners that were on there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4971.483s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They didn't even have an opportunity to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4974.025s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, the law is somewhat clear, but it's also somewhat fuzzy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4979.647s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In the open meeting law, in the guidelines promulgated by the Attorney General, it does say, it does give the distinction to the chairperson or the chair of the committee to allow people to speak at that person's discretion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=4991.535s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But it also says at the very end by the Attorney General, the Attorney General encourages public bodies to allow as much public participation as time allows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5001.661s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This was eight o'clock at night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5003.482s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Nobody was falling asleep in this audience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5005.724s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They were here because for a particular purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5009.114s">[Robert Penta]</a>: as much public participation as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5011.556s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And for that chairperson to shut off public participation and hear what was on people's minds was wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5018.864s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This same chairperson served as an alternate last year when the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Attorney General Office came in and told the Board of Appeals that they had to reopen the board because they were wrong in closing down a meeting that was in a continued meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5034.089s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, if this Board of Appeals doesn't want to understand the law and follow the guidelines by the State's Attorney General, then maybe we need a new board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5042.615s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maybe when you change the charter, we should have the Board of Appeals be elected instead of appointed that way there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5048.399s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maybe that would be the safest way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5050.521s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Neighborhood character and neighborhood future buildings be protected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5054.363s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5055.585s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You guys and ladies on this council, your biggest responsibility over the budget is zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5060.628s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What takes place in a community by its zoning?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5063.769s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can talk about it all you want, you can advertise it all you want, but people are saying nothing's taking place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5069.392s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This community has changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5070.973s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're in the middle of a lawsuit, they're suing the developer on Locust Street in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5076.136s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've gone to Miloka Street, you've gone to Middlesex Avenue, you've gone to Salem Street, and now you're over here in South Medford on Medford Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5082.959s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And one of the other arguments that were brought forth is the traffic going to be deposited onto the Medford Street, and Medford Street, as we all know, is a cut-through street to Somerville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5092.382s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These are all legitimate concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5094.783s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This isn't to say whether you're for or against the project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5097.504s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's the concerns that the people wanted to talk about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5101.265s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And when you shut the people off at the pass, that's why they have no respect and they don't believe in their government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5108.028s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's why it's incumbent upon you as city councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5110.689s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've been talking about it for two years, about changing your zoning, and you haven't done it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5114.69s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So whoever of you get re-elected, you should make that your priority, along with the new members of the council, that zoning is the number one priority, because you've seen what it's doing to this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5124.332s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've seen the character of neighborhoods being totally disrupted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5128.213s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you can't say it's not political when every member on the board is appointed by a political person, and that's the mayor of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5136.26s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if you want to have clean hands and let the neighborhood and let the taxpayers make that decision, because good zoning might be predicated upon people who get elected rather than people get appointed, that might set the tone in a different direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5149.651s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And just lastly, I want to say this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5152.374s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is Halloween.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5153.074s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is trick-or-treat night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5154.636s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And some of you have young children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5156.416s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it would have been a good call by you, Mr. President, to delay the meeting by at least an hour to let whoever had children to go out and trick or treat with their family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5164.184s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You still could have accomplished the city council meeting and we wouldn't be in the chaos that we're in right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5176.997s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And when was that, sir?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5182.202s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe you have 48 hours to change that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5184.083s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've had that since last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5185.784s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But other than that, I'd be more than happy to answer any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5188.066s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But how do you say it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5191.728s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There aren't too many things that you guys and girls really have super control over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5197.091s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Budget, voting it up and down, but zoning, it's all yours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5200.313s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You own it, lock, stock, and barrel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5202.734s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Use it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5203.815s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Don't let the administration abuse it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5205.876s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You guys and girls use it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=5208.148s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6108.577s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Just as a further point, just as a further point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6113.499s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, I can appreciate the developer coming here to make the comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6116.6s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But these comments were not made at the public hearing, for which a whole bunch of people, almost 100 in total, were here on that night, whether they were from Somerville or from Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6125.543s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Arguing the case here tonight with only a few of the residents is not the right way to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6131.025s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The issue on the sun, the issue on the barrels, that's all well and good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6134.526s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But we have four people here right now that have never heard it for the first time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6138.127s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You folks have taken it upon yourself to bring a suit against a developer on Locust Street because you were dissatisfied because the neighborhood was not addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6147.244s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Four of you just attended this past meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6149.841s">[Robert Penta]</a>: this past October 24th meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6151.763s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would strongly suggest that the four of you, if not seven of you, make a request to the Board of Appeals to ask them to delay any finality to making a decision and to reopen a public hearing to listen to all the stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6165.874s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because it's obvious that they didn't have a chance to listen to the people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6174.141s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, he can have all the meetings he's want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6176.322s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm talking about the Board of Appeals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6178.604s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As Mrs. Rodriguez just said, they're scheduled to make a final determination first week in November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6185.308s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There are two official complaints being filed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6187.77s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if they don't respond to them, it goes to the Attorney General's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6191.092s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, do you really want to go that far?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6193.534s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Or we can resolve it by maybe having the board, seven of you, respectfully request the Board of Appeals to delay any further action and to reopen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6208.042s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm asking a council Lungel Curran.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=201.815s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, um, on this address to the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=204.376s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert Penta zero summit road, former member of this board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=206.876s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Um, whether it be this question or the next one, it is maybe the terminology is wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=212.778s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It says medical cost is 5,000, but in the narrative it says medical bills are in excess of 6,500.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=219.68s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Could that be just explain why it's five and not 65 the next day about the next one is the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=248.068s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then the question is, under the term other, can you just explain, this is for clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=252.25s">[Robert Penta]</a>: For the purposes of other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=253.39s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Could she have collected the difference of 15?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=255.071s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Point of order, Councilor Nate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=264.269s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Your common practice is to allow people to speak at the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=267.271s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The Assistant City Solicitor is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=268.891s">[Robert Penta]</a>: She's willing to answer the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=270.132s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know what his problem is tonight, but if he wants to keep disrupting me every time I speak, he can show his rudeness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=275.695s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The Solicitor would— What is the gentleman suggesting that's problematic?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=289.822s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What's problematic, Councilman Knight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=291.723s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Pardon me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=294.199s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What does that mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=295.1s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm sure it's the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=297.181s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You better rest your case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=298.622s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Can you answer that please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=301.684s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm sorry, what was the question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=302.665s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The question on other, what does other mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=306.608s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Could you take the money from other in terms of picking up the difference?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=315.354s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=315.654s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On the chapter 84, you said the max is $5,000, but to get over and beyond that, there's a term there called other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=321.258s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is there any other way?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Zdo0mXKcWx0&t=322.498s">[Robert Penta]</a>: to get that person up to the 6,500?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2806.831s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of this August body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2813.676s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I come here to address the City Council on this important issue that has important but different consequences depending on what side of the issue that you might be on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2826.145s">[Robert Penta]</a>: At the outset, I want to address and thank Curtis Tudin for propelling this issue<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2831.714s">[Robert Penta]</a>: before our citizens of the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2834.415s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Since this is an election year and we're all running for office, those of you that are and those that might be candidates running for office, boasting about all the wonderful accomplishments and the hard votes that you had to take.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2847.181s">[Robert Penta]</a>: To me, this is a very important issue and I think it's an issue that needs to be presented and discussed and to have everybody, including the mayor, the city council, the school committee, take a position on this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2857.449s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because isn't it weird, when we think about our America today, and you see all the things that are taking place, whether it's before the National Football League, or little Pop Warner kids, the use of our American flag, the national anthem, seems to be at issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2875.734s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And our culture seems to be at issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2879.355s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But where are we going with all of that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2881.396s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2882.496s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Sanctuary City's had its beginning here in the United States back in the 1980s.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2886.778s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Central folks, central people from Central America left their country looking for political refuge because of the oppressive nature that was taking place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2896.962s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what took place here in this country, and the churches, many of the churches throughout this country, they took these folks in, believing them to be in need of help, and for which we did, we helped them out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2909.821s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But that sort of like has morphed itself since 1981 to what it is today, addressing itself to sanctuary cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2918.967s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as a result of sanctuary cities becoming what they are and having a different interpretation, you, Mr. President, just read something that was dated November 21, 2016.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2931.756s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you go to that third whereas, it says the city of Medford stands in support of all immigrant groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2937.7s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think the word before all,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2939.83s">[Robert Penta]</a>: an immigrant should be legal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2941.791s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All legal immigrant groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2944.051s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because we, the people of the United States, are a nation built on laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2949.533s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Its foundation is built on laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2952.014s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's on the legality of what we do each and every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2955.535s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it seems, and it seems that because of all this illegal immigration that is taking place in this country, you know, have we as a country now forgotten the fact or gotten to the point where everybody has a right<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2969.155s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're giving everybody rights, but nobody wants responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2973.497s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the responsibility that's being borne each and every day is the Mr. and Mrs. America, Mr. and Mrs. Medford taxpayer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2981.141s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, I cannot think of any prouder comment than something that's written on the banner of the VFW of Mystic Avenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2992.607s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It says, all lives matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2996.315s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Everybody's lives matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=2998.617s">[Robert Penta]</a>: White, black, blue, green, I don't care what nationality you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3002.46s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you're here in this country, and you're here legally, or you have the proper legal documents, earning your way to become an American citizen, your life matters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3011.847s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And for those folks that come here illegally, that's in and of itself the question that's before us right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3020.586s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We as a community are very generous to so many people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3024.389s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You members on the council, especially your two new members, Councilor Scarpel and Councilor Falco, you've just gone through two years of community block grant funding, and if you go through each and every one of those community block grant fundings, you will see the amount of money that's been dedicated and prioritized to charities within not only the city of Medford, but in the Tri-City and outside the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3046.085s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've also seen monies go to legal, council,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3050.216s">[Robert Penta]</a>: for people who have an illegal immigration condition needing to get itself resolved and coming forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3059.158s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We also have in this community all our churches and all the food pantries and the shelters taking care of as many people as they can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3068.241s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And while they're doing that, the question then becomes, who comes first, the illegal or the legal?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3076.423s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think a sanctuary city, in and of itself,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3080.219s">[Robert Penta]</a>: presents that particular situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3082.541s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Like I said, again, depending on what side of the issue you're on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3086.983s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Sanctuary cities throughout this country, and there's 200 of them right now, that bar the use of government resources to enforce federal immigration laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3096.99s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And they also allow illegals charged with crimes to be released without notifying federal authorities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3104.775s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, in a report that was submitted in December of 2014 to Congress,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3109.591s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It stated that more than 30,000 convicted criminals have been released by ICE at the end of 2014, and they have gone back to the states, to the cities and towns that they came from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3122.019s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But inclusive of those crimes,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3125.196s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There was 173 homicides, there were 373 sexual assaults, there were 186 kidnappings, and there was 1,000, excuse me, there was 14,014 drunk driving charges to individuals that did not have a license.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3131.558s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There were more than 30,000 convicted criminal citations issued during that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3152.065s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What does that say to the law abiding citizen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3154.887s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But more importantly, what does that say to law enforcement personnel?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3161.69s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Who especially now, if you're in a sanctuary city, you can't ask for identification as to are you an immigrant or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3169.214s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can't hold them, you can't call ISIS, excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3175.064s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It has a ramification that just really says to the police officer of today, beside doing my job for the city that I'm in, I am now having to become aware of somebody who might be here illegally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3190.393s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that person might get preferential treatment over someone who might be here legally, but that I can arrest and imprison.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3197.977s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's really not right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3200.609s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's a particular case that takes place from a gentleman and his two children that died.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3206.651s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He came from Levone, Texas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3209.112s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And he was hit by an illegal immigrant who hit him head on in a collision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3214.134s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And he killed him, his four-year-old son, and his 22-month-old, strike that, his four-year-old daughter and his 22-month-old son.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3223.017s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The illegal person was arrested and plea bargained to a two-year sentence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3231.283s">[Robert Penta]</a>: a two-year sentence for wiping out a husband, a father, and a daughter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3237.404s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The woman, subsequent to that, has had some kind of public, how could you say, retaliation, because she felt that the justice system didn't do her right, because she complained because of that, and the person that killed her husband, her daughter, and her son was Hispanic, she now becomes the culprit and not the victim.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3260.455s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These are just little nuances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3262.236s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We can go to the entire country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3264.318s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There are cases where police officers have been killed, shot, brutally murdered by illegal immigrants here in this country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3272.303s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's not right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3273.364s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Absolutely not right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3276.386s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When we think about what's going on, illegals, they have the benefits of our free medical system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3283.071s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They go to our quality schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3285.352s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They get free housing and free food.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3287.614s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But they don't choose to blend in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3289.653s">[Robert Penta]</a>: by learning English and assimilating to our American culture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3294.835s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And further, by committing crimes outside or inside the community or the state that they're in, it adds a definite cost to our police, to our public safety, to our public education, and to Mr. and Mrs. Medford and Mr. and Mrs. America.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3313.123s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the question then becomes, on a sanctuary city, you folks are running for office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3318.615s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I haven't seen one of you yet say or put anywhere in your literature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3322.816s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Just one gentleman so far, he's in the back of the room, made the point that he is for sanctuary cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3330.099s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I commend him for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3331.119s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He took his position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3333.26s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a very important issue to be discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3337.961s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because if you're telling me that you're abiding by this November 16th, strike that, November 23rd,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3346.365s">[Robert Penta]</a>: resolution, well, this smacks of all the ingredients of a sanctuary city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3351.129s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Either we are or we're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3354.292s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think you councilors and every candidate running for office needs to take that position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3359.656s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the reason why they need to take that position, whether you're for or against, in a common level headed society, while we don't have to agree, we can respectfully disagree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3371.752s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's where I think we need to be going here in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3375.515s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, when you say we're a welcoming community, as a matter of fact, there's a billboard coming in on Route 93.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3381.379s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It says we are a welcoming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3382.88s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We've always been a welcoming committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3384.661s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We've got the third largest black population in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and we've had it for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3391.326s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And slowly but surely, they're leaving because nobody can afford to stay there anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3395.129s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The cost of housing in this community has gone completely out of control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3398.872s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Makes no sense at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3400.868s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if this present administration keeps wanting to put housing all over the place, and if this council doesn't want to review zoning, that's what's going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3408.572s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can have a city so out of control, you're not going to be able to understand what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3412.474s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And Dr. Stirella was right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3413.995s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Your finances will be so out of control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3416.656s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you add a sanctuary city to the mix, then please explain why you're doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3422.399s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And please let the people know as a candidate for office that a sanctuary city, you're either for it or against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3428.729s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. Panto, we're running, you're running over your time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3441.36s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think the bottom line, my comment would basically, I don't think any city council, any mayor, any school committee person or anyone<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3450.615s">[Robert Penta]</a>: should tell a police department how to do their job, especially whether they're legal or illegal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=3457.244s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's their job to protect and to serve, and not to be controlled by a political hierarchy in a community that turns around and says, we want to be a sanctuary city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5725.656s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5725.976s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert Penteciro, Summit Road, Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5729.079s">[Robert Penta]</a>: First of all, for the young lady to my behind me,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5733.038s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm not a white privileged individual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5735.439s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I've had to work for everything in my life, starting at five o'clock in the morning for eight consecutive years, driving a canteen truck, being held up three times, shot at twice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5747.925s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I didn't give up because I knew what I wanted to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5751.327s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I wanted to get a college education and go forward with my life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5755.629s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's what I did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5756.89s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I did not come here tonight to be decisive or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5762.048s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Have people become decisive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5763.531s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I came here tonight to present an issue, thanking Mr. Tudin, who made the acknowledgement that he is for a sanctuary city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5771.745s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a subject matter that needs to be discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5775.236s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The statistics that were given are actual statistics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5778.838s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can't get away because they're not lying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5781.899s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And for the other lady who indicated that the crime rate for the individuals who are undocumented are less than regular American citizens that are documented and are legal, that in and of itself spells to the question of the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5798.487s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're doing more work because they have to deal with undocumented illegals over and beyond their regular course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5806.214s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, are all of them bad people?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5808.696s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Absolutely not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5809.897s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Do they deserve a fair shot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5812.239s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5814.298s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if they have to have some political intervention, which is taking place right now in Washington, so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5820.324s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the fact of the matter is this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5822.566s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I stand here and I resent the fact that anyone, any seven of you or anyone in this audience, who wants to turn around and say, because I was born white, that I am privileged, that is false, that is wrong, and that is a lie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5835.519s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you should be ashamed of yourself for saying that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=5838.321s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2122.993s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford Mass, former member of this August body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2129.818s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I come here to address the City Council on this important issue that has important but different consequences depending on what side of the issue that you might be on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2142.287s">[Robert Penta]</a>: At the outset, I want to address and thank Curtis Tooden for propelling this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2147.877s">[Robert Penta]</a>: before our citizens of the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2150.559s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Since this is an election year and we're all running for office, those of you that are and those that might be candidates running for office, boasting about all the wonderful accomplishments and the hard votes that you had to take.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2163.325s">[Robert Penta]</a>: To me, this is a very important issue and I think it's an issue that needs to be presented and discussed and to have everybody, including the mayor, the city council and the school committee take a position on this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2173.609s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because isn't it weird, when we think about our America today and you see all the things that are taking place, whether it's before the National Football League or Little Pop Wanna Kids, the use of our American flag, the national anthem, seems to be at issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2191.897s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And our culture seems to be at issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2195.518s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But where are we going with all of that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2197.559s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2198.379s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, Sanctuary City's had its beginning here in the United States back in the 1980s.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2202.941s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Central folks, central people from Central America left their country looking for political refuge because of the oppressive nature that was taking place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2213.107s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what took place here in this country, and the churches, many of the churches throughout this country, they took these folks in, believing them to be in need of help, and for which we did, we helped them out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2225.964s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But that sort of like has morphed itself since 1981 to what it is today, addressing itself to sanctuary cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2235.111s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as a result of sanctuary cities becoming what they are and having a different interpretation, you, Mr. President, just read something that was dated November 21, 2016.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2247.861s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you go to that third whereas, it says the city of Medford stands in support of all immigrant groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2253.666s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think the word before all<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2255.939s">[Robert Penta]</a>: an immigrant should be legal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2257.9s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All legal immigrant groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2260.16s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because we, the people of the United States, are a nation built on laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2265.642s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Its foundation is built on laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2268.123s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's on the legality of what we do each and every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2271.664s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it seems, and it seems that because of all this illegal immigration that is taking place in this country, you know, have we as a country now forgotten the fact or gotten to the point where everybody has a right<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2285.282s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're giving everybody rights, but nobody wants responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2289.623s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the responsibility that's being borne each and every day is the Mr. and Mrs. America, Mr. and Mrs. Medford Taxpayer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2297.265s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, I cannot think of any prouder comment than something that's written on the banner of the VFW of Mystic Avenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2308.728s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It says, all lives matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2312.441s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Everybody's lives matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2314.743s">[Robert Penta]</a>: White, black, blue, green.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2315.944s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't care what nationality you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2318.586s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you're here in this country and you're here legally or you have the proper legal documents earning your way to become an American citizen, your life matters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2327.973s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And for those folks that come here illegally, that's in and of itself the question that's before us right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2335.459s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2336.713s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We as a community are very generous to so many people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2340.515s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You members on the council, especially your two new members, Councilor Scarpel and Councilor Falco, you've just gone through two years of community block grant funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2347.998s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you go through each and every one of those community block grant fundings, you will see the amount of money that's been dedicated and prioritized to charities within not only the city of Medford, but in the Tri-City and outside the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2362.224s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've also seen monies go to legal, council,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2366.36s">[Robert Penta]</a>: for people who have an illegal immigration condition needing to get itself resolved and coming forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2375.302s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We also have in this community all our churches and all the food pantries and the shelters taking care of as many people as they can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2384.383s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And while they're doing that, the question then becomes, who comes first, the illegal or the legal?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2392.564s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think a sanctuary city, in and of itself,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2396.383s">[Robert Penta]</a>: presents that particular situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2398.684s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Like I said, again, depending on what side of the issue you're on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2403.127s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Sanctuary cities throughout this country, and there's 200 of them right now, that bar the use of government resources to enforce federal immigration laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2413.133s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And they also allow illegals charged with crimes to be released without notifying federal authorities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2420.918s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, in a report that was submitted in December of 2014 to Congress,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2425.754s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It stated that more than 30,000 convicted criminals have been released by ICE at the end of 2014, and they have gone back to the states, to the cities and towns that they came from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2438.123s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But inclusive of those crimes, there was 173 homicides, there were 373 sexual assaults, there were 186 kidnappings, and there was 1,000, excuse me, there was 14,014<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2456.055s">[Robert Penta]</a>: drunk driving charges to individuals that did not have a license.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2460.597s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There were more than 30,000 convicted criminal citations issued during that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2468.18s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What does that say to the law abiding citizen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2471.002s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But more importantly, what does that say to law enforcement personnel?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2477.79s">[Robert Penta]</a>: who especially now, if you're in a sanctuary city, you can't ask for identification as to are you an immigrant or not, you can't hold them, you can't call ISIS, excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2491.159s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It has a ramification that just really says to the police officer of today, beside doing my job for the city that I'm in, I am now having to become aware of somebody who might be here illegally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2506.499s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that person might get preferential treatment over someone who might be illegally, but that I can arrest and imprison.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2514.081s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's really not right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2516.701s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's a particular case that takes place from a gentleman and his two children that died.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2522.762s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He came from Lavon, Texas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2525.223s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And he was hit by an illegal immigrant who hit him head on in a collision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2530.244s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And he killed him, his four-year-old son, and his 22-month-old<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2535.14s">[Robert Penta]</a>: striped out his four-year-old daughter and his 22-year-old son.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2539.102s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The illegal person was arrested and plea bargained to a two-year sentence, a two-year sentence for wiping out a husband, a father, and a daughter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2553.508s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The woman subsequent to that has had some kind of public, how could you say, retaliation<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2562.588s">[Robert Penta]</a>: because she felt that the justice system didn't do her right, because she complained because of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2568.753s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the person that killed her husband, her daughter, and her son was Hispanic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2572.396s">[Robert Penta]</a>: She now becomes the culprit and not the victim.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2576.579s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These are just little nuances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2578.34s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We can go to the entire country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2580.442s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There are cases where police officers have been killed, shot, brutally murdered by illegal immigrants here in this country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2588.408s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's not right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2589.469s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Absolutely not right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2592.469s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When we think about what's going on, illegals, they have the benefits of our free medical system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2599.152s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They go to our quality schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2601.433s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They get free housing and free food.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2603.694s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But they don't choose to blend in by learning English and assimilating to our American culture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2610.938s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And further, by committing crimes outside or inside the community or the state that they're in,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2618.539s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It adds a definite cost to our police, to our public safety, to our public education, and to Mr. and Mrs. Medford and Mr. and Mrs. America.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2629.225s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the question then becomes, on a sanctuary city, you folks are running for office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2634.708s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I haven't seen one of you yet say or put anywhere in your literature, just one gentleman so far, he's in the back of the room, made the point that he is for sanctuary cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2646.235s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I commend him for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2647.255s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He took his position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2649.369s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a very important issue to be discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2654.07s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because if you're telling me that you're abiding by this November 16th, strike that, November 23rd resolution, well this smacks of all the ingredients of a sanctuary city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2667.254s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Either we are or we're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2670.415s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think you Councilors and every candidate running for office needs to take that position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2675.757s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the reason why they need to take that position, whether you're for or against,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2680.441s">[Robert Penta]</a>: in a common, level-headed society, while we don't have to agree, we can respectfully disagree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2687.861s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's where I think we need to be going here in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2691.622s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, when you say we're a welcoming community, as a matter of fact, there's a billboard coming in on Route 93.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2697.483s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It says we are a welcoming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2698.984s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We've always been a welcoming committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2700.764s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We've got the third largest black population in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and we've had it for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2707.426s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And slowly but surely, they're leaving because nobody can afford to stay there anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2711.227s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The cost of housing in this community has gone completely out of control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2714.968s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Makes no sense at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2716.977s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if this present administration keeps wanting to put housing all over the place, and if this council doesn't want to review zoning, that's what's going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2724.681s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can have a city so out of control, you're not going to be able to understand what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2728.583s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And Dr. Stirella was right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2730.104s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Your finances will be so out of control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2732.765s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you add a sanctuary city to the mix, then please explain why you're doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2738.508s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And please let the people know as a candidate for office, that a sanctuary city, you're either for it or against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2757.509s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think the bottom line, my comment would basically, I don't think any city council, any mayor, any school committee person or anyone,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2766.741s">[Robert Penta]</a>: should tell a police department how to do their job, especially whether they're legal or illegal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=2773.389s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's their job to protect and to serve, and not to be controlled by a political hierarchy in a community that turns around and says, we want to be a sanctuary city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5041.629s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5041.949s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert Penteciro, Summit Road, Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5045.05s">[Robert Penta]</a>: First of all, for the young lady behind me, I'm not a white privileged individual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5052.355s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Had to work for everything in my life, starting at five o'clock in the morning for eight consecutive years, driving a canteen truck, being held up three times, shot at twice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5063.944s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I didn't give up because I knew what I wanted to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5067.326s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I wanted to get a college education and go forward with my life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5071.65s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's what I did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5072.891s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I did not come here tonight to be decisive or have people become decisive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5079.556s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I came here tonight to present an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5081.707s">[Robert Penta]</a>: thanking Mr. Tudin, who made the acknowledgement that he is for a sanctuary city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5087.763s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a subject matter that needs to be discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5091.257s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The statistics that were given are actual statistics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5094.859s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can't get away, because they're not lying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5097.921s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And for the other lady who indicated that the crime rate for the individuals who are undocumented are less than regular American citizens that are documented and are legal, that in and of itself spells to the question of the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5114.511s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're doing more work because they have to deal with undocumented illegals over and beyond their regular course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5122.235s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, are all of them bad people?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5124.736s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Absolutely not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5125.936s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Do they deserve a fair shot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5128.278s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5130.359s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if they have to have some political intervention, which is taking place right now in Washington, so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5136.341s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the fact of the matter is this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5138.601s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I stand here and I resent the fact that anyone, any seven of you or anyone in this audience, who wants to turn around and say, because I was born white, that I am privileged, that is false, that is wrong, and that is a lie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5151.525s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you should be ashamed of yourself for saying that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=5154.346s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2073.491s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2077.695s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The part that I think is concerning is when we go back to the September 19 meeting and I don't know if Mr. Burns is in the other room or not but the question was asked when he came to the podium and he couldn't answer the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2091.3s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I know the solicitor is here so he may want to answer it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2095.201s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I just don't know what somebody can do to make a presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2099.846s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If they can submit it by mail, which means they need a query check, if they don't need a query check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2104.871s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Right now, do all you Councilors need a query check because you're in a building where you're close to children that are outside in the school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2111.378s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The next question begs itself to City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2113.359s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Does every member of City Hall, every employee need a query check because if a parent comes in there or a taxpayer comes in there with a child and the child goes to the bathroom and the child is not with the parent and there's an employee there, does that subject the city or the employee to some kind of liability of a query check?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2128.83s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2129.951s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I think this whole issue has opened up a great question needs to be asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2134.634s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why do we need a query check and under what conditions and circumstances do we need it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2139.117s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If I understand this thing properly, if I'm a candidate for office like the seven of you are, a candidate for office, and if you come in here, supposedly you don't need a query check, but if you submit your<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2151.515s">[Robert Penta]</a>: take a desk by mail when you need a query check, or can you come in at any time, even though you're independent of your role as a Councilor being here tonight, walk around the building, and for that purpose, do you need a query check?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2162.848s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Do employees in this building, custodians in this building, do they need a query check as it relates to their interaction with students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2169.335s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2170.696s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I understand that teachers, when they come on board, there's a query check sign on them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2174.819s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I understand all of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2175.939s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I don't know the nuances about everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2177.62s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Contractors, and I think we had here a couple of weeks ago, there was a gentleman come up, said he was putting lights in a certain part of the building, and in their second shift the question was asked, they said that they would be getting a query check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2188.787s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay, that's all well and good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2190.367s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I'd like to, I know the solicitor's here, but I'd like to have the council have a report that comes out that basically said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2196.951s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How is a query check going to be implemented?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2200.372s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And more importantly, if a taxpayer citizen wants to come up, work this room, submit a tape, does that taxpayer citizen have to be query checked or not?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2209.115s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, because don't forget, this whole idea of public access was just what it's for, public access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2214.337s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if it was in any other location but this place here, I don't think we would be talking about a query check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2219.478s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I understand that this has its own entrance, its own locks, and it's separate from the main entrance of the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2225.377s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I believe that in and of itself should probably give some credence that a query check is not needed, however this room is being used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2232.102s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I think we need some clarification to finalize this thing and we can move on with an election which is right around the corner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2238.427s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And let me just say this one last thing about the election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2240.769s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a damn shame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2242.148s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a damn shame, and I use the word damn shame, that this room and the access used for this was not in place prior to the primary election where all the candidates, incumbents, would have had an opportunity to come and make their presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2255.42s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This unfortunately seems to be at a last minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2257.582s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a quick ploy to get itself in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2259.484s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've got your notices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2261.345s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The last one is tomorrow or the next day this week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2263.648s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's sort of like- It's sort of like- They've extended the schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2266.37s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They have extended the schedule but it's a little unfair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2268.772s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This has been running around for a long period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2271.095s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They had $650,000 of taxpayers' money from Verizon and Comcast that was used to put this building together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2278.462s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This has been taking place for a long period of time and I think it's just a little bit unfair and especially when the rules are inconsistent right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2286.529s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think that's what we need to know whether you're an incumbent or a newcomer running for this office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2291.374s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So, I would say before you take it and receive it and place it on file, I think those questions should be answered before you take that and receive it and place it on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2300.598s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2303.499s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. Solicitor, the paper's already been disposed of, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2113.873s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2117.817s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert Pantazero, Summit Road, Miffin Mass, former member of the Saugus party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2121.98s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The part that I think is concerning is when we go back to that September 19th meeting, and I don't know if Mr. Burns is in the other room or not, but the question that was asked of him when he came to the podium, he couldn't answer the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2131.647s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I know the solicitor is here, so he may want to answer it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2135.59s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I just don't know what somebody can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2138.452s">[Robert Penta]</a>: to make a presentation if they can submit it by mail, which means they need a query check if they don't need a query check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2145.215s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Right now, do all you Councilors need a query check because you're in a building where you're close to children that are outside in the school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2151.797s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The next question begs itself to City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2153.758s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Does every member of City Hall, every employee need a query check because if a parent comes in there or a taxpayer comes in there with a child and the child goes to the bathroom and the child is not with the parent,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2164.402s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and there's an employee there, does that subject the city or the employee to some kind of liability of a query check?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2169.226s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2170.327s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I think this whole issue has opened up a great question needs to be asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2175.031s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why do we need a query check and under what conditions and circumstances do we need it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2179.534s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If I understand this thing properly, if I'm a candidate for office like the seven of you are, a candidate for office, and if you come in here, supposedly you don't need a query check, but if you submit your<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2191.867s">[Robert Penta]</a>: take a desk by mail when you need a query check, or can you come in at any time, even though you're independent of your role as a Councilor being here tonight, walk around the building, and for that purpose, do you need a query check?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2203.216s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Do employees in this building, custodians in this building, do they need a query check as it relates to their interaction with students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2209.701s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2210.121s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, I understand that teachers, when they come on board, there's a query check sign on them, I understand all of that, but I don't know the nuances about everyone, contractors,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2219.128s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think we had here a couple of weeks ago, there was a gentleman come up, said he was putting lights in a certain part of the building, and in their second shift the question was asked, they said that they would be getting a query checked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2229.151s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay, that's all well and good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2230.731s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I'd like to, I know the solicitor's here, but I'd like to have the council have a report that comes out that basically said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2237.313s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How is a query check going to be implemented?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2240.755s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And more importantly, if a taxpayer citizen wants to come up, work this room, submit a tape, does that taxpayer citizen have to be query checked or not?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2249.5s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, because don't forget, this whole idea of public access was just what it's for, public access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2254.703s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if it was in any other location but this place here, I don't think we would be talking about a query check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2259.846s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I understand that this has its own entrance, its own locks, and it's separate from the main entrance of the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2265.742s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I believe that in and of itself should probably give some credence that a query check is not needed, however this room is being used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2272.47s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I think we need some clarification to finalize this thing and we can move on with an election which is right around the corner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2278.798s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And let me just say this one last thing about the election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2281.14s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a damn shame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2282.502s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a damn shame, and I use the word damn shame, that this room and the access used for this was not in place prior to the primary election where all the candidates, incumbents, would have had an opportunity to come and make their presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2295.789s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This unfortunately seems to be at a last minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2297.95s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a quick ploy to get itself in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2299.851s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've got your notices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2301.692s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The last one is tomorrow or the next day this week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2304.014s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's sort of like- I think they've extended the schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2306.735s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They've extended the schedule, but it's a little bit unfair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2308.897s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, this has been running around for a long period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2311.46s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They had $650,000 of taxpayers' money from Verizon and Comcast that was used to put this building together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2318.827s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This has been taking place for a long period of time, and I think it's just a little bit unfair, and especially when the rules are inconsistent right now, I think that's what we need to know, whether you're an incumbent or a newcomer running for this office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2331.739s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So, I would say before you take it and receive it and place it on file, I think those questions should be answered before you take that and receive it and place it on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2341.003s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2343.884s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. Solicitor, the paper's already been disposed of, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1666.095s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass, former member of the Saugus party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1671.557s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I present this to you, and I believe all of you got a copy of, that's a three page document that was mailed out early this summer, pursuant to the request of Council Wendell Curran to explain the rationale behind having a local option filing piece of legislation regarding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1691.317s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Community Preservation Act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1693.098s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When this Community Preservation Act was being sold to the folks here in the city of Medford, they were passing out pieces of literature such as this, talked about the Community Preservation Act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1702.48s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And on the back it says, communities submit annual reports to the state before receiving matching funds to ensure funds are properly spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1712.303s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Matching funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1714.184s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In 2002, which was the first year of the Community Preservation Act,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1717.838s">[Robert Penta]</a>: For the first six years, cities and towns got 100% of their monies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1722.723s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And at that point in time, there was 113 communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1726.646s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, in 2015, when the city of Medford voted for it, there's 156 communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1732.552s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And all we're getting back this year is approximately 14.5%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1735.655s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's up to 178 communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1741.436s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The problem that's existing, speaking to these communities, and a lot of the folks, these legislators in these communities, are beginning to realize now that the tax, the CPA tax, the community preservation tax that people are paying for is not being matched by the Commonwealth of Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1758.159s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We voted for this in 2015.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1760.801s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Its first year of payment is now coming to us in 2017, this November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1766.246s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's approximately $180,000, and we, the committee, collected $1.2 million, $500,000 of taxpayers' money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1775.594s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The legislation that I'm proposing is not to abolish the CPA, but rather to make it fair and equitable<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1782.858s">[Robert Penta]</a>: for the folks who voted for it, and especially for the people of Medford who believed, when they voted for this, that the Commonwealth was going to match dollar for dollar through the trust fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1792.685s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And how it's being proposed right now is when you go to the Registry of Deeds, and whether it's a municipal lien or a tax on your real estate deeds, it's $10 or $20.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1800.651s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What they're thinking right now is doubling it, and that would constitute another tax on people who buy and sell property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1809.497s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But putting that aside, until that happens,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1812.06s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was 2013 when it was then Governor DeVal Patrick who took $20 million, I believe, $25 million from the surplus money of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts just to meet the bare bones minimum of monies to go back to cities and towns in 2013.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1829.507s">[Robert Penta]</a>: it was approximately 52% of the monies went back to the cities and towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1833.848s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're down now to 14%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1835.988s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the law says the state cannot go any lower than 5%, which is sort of like outrageous because you're gonna keep taxing taxpayers in this community for something that's not being met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1847.27s">[Robert Penta]</a>: People believed when they voted for the Community Preservation Act that the Commonwealth of Mass would match that dollar for dollar, it was advertised as such, and it was stated as such.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1857.485s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The two exceptions that I'm asking you folks to consider, and if you don't wanna vote on it tonight, that's all right, but I would appreciate it at least going to the city solicitor for the purposes of the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1867.927s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm asking that there be a hold on the city going further on collecting any monies from taxpayers under the CPA Community Preservation Act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1877.248s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because right now, it's not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1878.949s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're telling the taxpayer that they have being taxed at 1.5% of their real estate value minus the first $100,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1887.685s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But at the same time, they're not gonna be getting that dollar amount from the trust fund, from the Commonwealth of Mass back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1892.37s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1893.771s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Number two, the second part of the resolve is that this is a five-year commitment, as you know, and it automatically renews itself after five years, unless there's a legislative question on the ballot not to renew it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1906.679s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This second option is to have it go on the ballot automatically to renew it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1911.9s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So it dies, it's like sunset legislation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1914.281s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It just dies at the end of five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1916.621s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if the community still wants to have it and they wanna go forward with it, they put it back on the ballot once again and the people can vote for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1923.663s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't think it's anything that's detrimental to this community other than the fact you're gonna keep taxing rate payers in this community for something they're not getting their money's worth for and they're not getting the match for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1934.146s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this greatly will impede<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1936.272s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This will greatly impede the concerns and the issues, whether it be for parks, historical pieces of property, low income housing, whatever the decision might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1946.001s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Plus the fact I believe that they're paying somebody approximately $65,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1948.143s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. Pender, can I see that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1949.223s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1949.464s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1958.111s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe approximately right now somebody's getting paid, I believe if I understood when this came out a couple of months ago, somebody's gonna be paid approximately $65,000, $62,000, $149,000, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1966.26s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So we've collected $1,242,974 from the Medford taxpayers in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1968.062s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But all you're getting back from the Commonwealth of Mass is approximately $180,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1980.615s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1981.777s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's not the way this was supposed to be going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1983.839s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And now with more people coming on board, there's now 176 people applying for these monies from the Commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1992.384s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and having to go to the registry of deeds to double increase the taxes for municipal liens and for deed stamps that goes on our recordings, that's not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2004.15s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Just to meet the bare bones minimum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2007.151s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This year it's only 14%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2008.472s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was reported in the local press earlier this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2011.253s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You call the state house, they'll tell you the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2013.734s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you call, for which I had a long extensive conversation with the people in Boston, it's called the CPA,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2022.057s">[Robert Penta]</a>: in Boston, their research people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2026.223s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is not, this is not to say I or anyone opposed to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2031.75s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What I'm opposed to is the inequity that this is now presented here within our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2036.736s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this inequity is not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2038.939s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because people are believing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2041.105s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you're only given $180,000 back on the $1.24 million, well, all we're asking to do is to put this on hold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2048.928s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Medford taxpayers do not have to pay for this until such time that the Commonwealth meets its obligation for the purposes of giving the reimbursement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2057.192s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what sold this program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2059.032s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what people voted for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2060.473s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's what they believed that they were getting, a match from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2064.075s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And unfortunately, it's not existing, and it's not there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2067.92s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That should have been told, that should have been explained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2069.661s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think, Mr. Clerk, you can attest to the fact over 1,200 people never turned their ballot over in 2015 to vote yes or no on the question itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2078.104s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So whether the people were not informed properly when they went to vote, or they just didn't want to vote, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2083.686s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But that's an awful lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2084.666s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I just think it takes into the serious consideration of today, hard times, people, water connectivity fee, water and sewer taxes, your tax rate keeps going up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2096.006s">[Robert Penta]</a>: new police station, new fire station, a library.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2099.948s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where is this money coming from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2101.489s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's the most unfair way to go out and tax somebody right now on this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2106.071s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is a state issue for which people went on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2109.331s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe that this would be one way to at least mitigate until the Commonwealth of Mass gets its act together, either they're going to give the 100% back or they're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2118.442s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why should you deal with the idea that we'll, we guarantee 5% because that's what the law says?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2122.887s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, what's 5%?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2123.828s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's meaningless.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2125.69s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That is stupid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2127.512s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm more than happy to answer any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2159.19s">[Robert Penta]</a>: With all due respect, Rick, I have a folder here, and if you want to, I'll go over it with you, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2165.312s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This first came across the city council in 1991, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2170.154s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And in 1991, when this came out, when it became part of its first proposal, I think the then-Method City Council<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2176.276s">[Robert Penta]</a>: did not want to entertain it at the time because they felt it was another tax on the people, unfairly hitting them without having a say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2183.903s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you only can put it in those four particular areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2186.345s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Right now, okay, the people voted for it, we accept that, I got no problem with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2190.289s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But how do you continue to go forward and tax the people when you're not even getting the money back?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2194.593s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're not even getting 50% of it back, you're only getting 14.5% of the money back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2197.075s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's totally unfair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2201.599s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you go to these other cities and towns and you talk to them like I have, a lot of them are not realizing it until you go in there and you start reading the information that they have there and how it's broken down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2211.204s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I got volumes on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2213.125s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't sit home and read this for my health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2215.005s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm concerned about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2216.246s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it's an end run on Proposition 2.5 if you continue to tax the people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2221.142s">[Robert Penta]</a>: at the way you're going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2222.583s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is an alternative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2224.364s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a legitimate alternative that a city and town can pose, and until such time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2229.507s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this is only good for five years, remember that, because the first year that you voted for was 15 to 16, and you had to get those numbers together, so you're not getting that money until 17.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2238.812s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the city of Medford is only gonna get it for four of the five years on the CPA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2243.034s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then if it goes automatically after that, it'll be every year on and after that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2246.796s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But what I'm saying is at the end of the fifth year, Rick,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2250.413s">[Robert Penta]</a>: the option would be that it ends, it becomes part of sunset legislation, and if the community wants to do it again, they put it on the ballot like they did the first time, and the people can vote it up or they can vote it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2410.106s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what I'm asking here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2411.367s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Motion to sever the papers, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2437.129s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. Chase, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2446.291s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You could go through the state delegation, but you also could go through your local legislative body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2450.64s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's why I said a local home will petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2452.663s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'd like to make one correction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2453.665s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I said 1991.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2454.287s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was 2001 when this first came up in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2458.461s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And from 2001, 2002, which was the first year, to 2007, the first six years, 100% went back to cities and towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2467.528s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But they started off at 34, and then they went to 113 cities and towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2472.071s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The next year, from 2008 going forward, you went from 127, now up to 176, and it's been downhill ever since.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2479.917s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And again, we're just looking at equity, something that's fair to the Medford taxpayer,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2486.636s">[Robert Penta]</a>: especially the one that doesn't realize they're not getting it, that the state is not matching the money, as they said, and that's the term that they used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2493.659s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Their own booklet, when they sent it out, way back when, it broke down all the cities and towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2498.641s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And like I said, I would just be asking respectfully that the council either forward this to the city solicitor and ask him if this could be done, and if not, then we go to the second row, asking our state legislation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2538.91s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Things that you want us to present to the city solicitor asking Right in the letter it designates both sections of the law section to amend section 16 a and section 16 B of the sections 4 to 7 sections 3 to 7 of chapter 44 which this city accepted when they voted for the for the act in 2015<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2563.064s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The legality of the law or if he would prepare legally a home rule petition that could be forwarded to our state legislators for the purposes of, again, this is not repealing it or getting rid of it, just to amend what's there until such time that the Commonwealth<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2582.745s">[Robert Penta]</a>: figures out how to give us the 100% back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2588.369s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's part of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2592.873s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, no, that's part of the proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2595.054s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Not now, not doing it right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2597.777s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Filing the piece of legislation that would allow cities and towns through their local legislative body to hold back collecting until 100% and then the second part would be if this were to be accepted and voted upon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2798.991s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you read the last sentence of my paragraph, the intent of this home rule, local option petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2804.432s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a local option petition filed if the city of Medford feels that they would like to go forward as a local option petition for which the people would have a chance to vote on it, so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2815.816s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If they don't have that option,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2817.497s">[Robert Penta]</a>: than the local option, then we would take it to the legislature and have them file it for whatever the purposes might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2823.124s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm presenting it because I really think it's sort of like unfair to tax these people, to tax our citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2828.772s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I said in 2013, $25 million was taken out of the surplus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2835.39s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In 2014, $11.4 million was taken out of the state surplus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2840.093s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And in 2015, $10 million was taken out of the state surplus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2843.034s">[Robert Penta]</a>: From 2016 forward, there's been no surplus and no money to be taken out, and all that's happening is people are being taxed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2850.078s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Unfairly being taxed for something that they're not getting their money back on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2853.94s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's like you going to the store and buying a new suit, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2858.762s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And they said it's $199, you go there, it's $300 because they didn't tell you about all the other incidentals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2864.125s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2865.126s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All we're asking for is equity, fairness to this whole thing, and having an opportunity just to present it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2870.768s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Again, this is not to kill it, to squash it or anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2873.41s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's just to bring equity until such time that the Commonwealth can prove, can prove.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2877.612s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Councilor Marks, you just said it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2879.653s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You spoke to someone up there and they said they created something, they can't control it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2884.395s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a monster that's out of control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2886.196s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But unfortunately, the rate payers, the taxpayers are paying for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2889.818s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2890.638s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't believe that that is fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3008.034s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So, is Councilor Knight saying it's okay to tax the people without getting the adjustment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3012.298s">[Robert Penta]</a>: redemption for why they voted for this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3033.46s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is Councilor Knight alleging that I'm spewing false information, and that my statistics are wrong, that we're only getting 14%, okay, 14.55%?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3042.73s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, I think you go back and listen to what he said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3045.319s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why don't you go back and listen to it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3051.343s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I just can't believe that a board would want to continuously tax people in this room, in this community, knowing that it's wrong because the Commonwealth is not at least meeting its obligation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3063.791s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They can't even get to 50%, never mind 15%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3067.833s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's just wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3075.997s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Rick, it's right there on the back of the card.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3078.978s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It says matching funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3645.861s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The letter that you wrote from the gentleman from the CPA incorrectly states that this was a petition to apply to all cities and towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3651.844s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3653.269s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that basically... That's what he wrote back to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3657.151s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Apparently you didn't translate it properly, or you didn't understand it properly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3660.072s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I kind of transparent what you said to me to make sure that I... But apparently it was wrong because I don't want anyone to be misled to think that I'm asking this for all cities and towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3668.757s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was just for the city of Medford, a local community home rule petition option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3878.347s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So there's no appetite here to send this to the city solicitor for the purposes of reviewing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3883.071s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So what we're saying is just keep taxing the people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3890.278s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well would you do it Mr. President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1806.782s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass, former member of the Saugus Party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1812.243s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I present this to you, and I believe all of you got a copy of, that's a three-page document that was mailed out early this summer, pursuant to the request of Councilwoman McCurran to explain the rationale behind having a local option filing piece of legislation regarding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1832.004s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Community Preservation Act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1833.785s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When this Community Preservation Act was being sold to the folks here in the city of Medford, they were passing out pieces of literature such as this, talked about the Community Preservation Act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1843.187s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And on the back it says, communities submit annual reports to the state before receiving matching funds to ensure funds are properly spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1852.99s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Matching funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1854.871s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In 2002, which was the first year of the Community Preservation Act,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1858.525s">[Robert Penta]</a>: For the first six years, cities and towns got 100% of their monies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1863.41s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And at that point in time, there was 113 communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1867.333s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, in 2015, when the city of Medford voted for it, there's 156 communities, and all we're getting back this year is approximately 14.5%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1876.342s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's up to 178 communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1882.14s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The problem that's existing, speaking to these communities, and a lot of the folks, these legislators in these communities, are beginning to realize now that the tax, the CPA tax, the community preservation tax that people are paying for is not being matched by the Commonwealth of Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1898.846s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We voted for this in 2015.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1901.509s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Its first year of payment is now coming to us in 2017, this November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1906.954s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's approximately $180,000, and we, the committee, collected $1.2 million, $500,000 of taxpayers' money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1916.283s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The legislation that I'm proposing is not to abolish the CPA, but rather to make it fair and equitable<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1923.545s">[Robert Penta]</a>: for the folks who voted for it, and especially for the people of Medford who believed, when they voted for this, that the Commonwealth was going to match dollar for dollar through the trust fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1933.347s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And how it's being proposed right now is when you go to the Registry of Deeds, and whether it's a municipal lien or a tax on your real estate deeds, it's $10 or $20.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1941.289s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What they're thinking right now is doubling it, and that would constitute another tax on people who buy and sell property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1950.151s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But putting that aside, until that happens,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1952.71s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was 2013 when it was then Governor DeVal Patrick who took $20 million, I believe, $25 million from the surplus money of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts just to meet the bare bones minimum of monies to go back to cities and towns in 2013.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1970.16s">[Robert Penta]</a>: it was approximately 52% of the monies went back to the cities and towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1974.522s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're down now to 14%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1976.643s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the law says the state cannot go any lower than 5%, which is sort of like outrageous because you're gonna keep taxing taxpayers in this community for something that's not being met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1987.948s">[Robert Penta]</a>: People believed when they voted for the Community Preservation Act that the Commonwealth of Mass would match that dollar for dollar, it was advertised as such, and it was stated as such.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1998.122s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The two exceptions that I'm asking you folks to consider, and if you don't wanna vote on it tonight, that's all right, but I would appreciate it at least going to the city solicitor for the purposes of the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2008.59s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm asking that there be a hold on the city going further on collecting any monies from taxpayers under the CPA Community Preservation Act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2017.916s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because right now, it's not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2019.617s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're telling the taxpayer that they have being taxed at 1.5% of their real estate value minus the first $100,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2028.322s">[Robert Penta]</a>: but at the same time they're not going to be getting that dollar amount from the trust fund, from the Commonwealth of Mass Bath.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2033.004s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2034.405s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Number two, the second part of the resolve is that this is a five-year commitment as you know, and it automatically renews itself after five years, unless there's a legislative question on the ballot not to renew it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2047.363s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This second option is to have it go on the ballot automatically to renew it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2052.607s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So it dies, it's like sunset legislation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2054.989s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It just dies at the end of five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2057.33s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if the community still wants to have it and they wanna go forward with it, they put it back on the ballot once again and the people can vote for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2064.375s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't think it's anything that's detrimental to this community other than the fact you're gonna keep taxing rate payers in this community for something they're not getting their money's worth for and they're not getting the match for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2074.843s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this greatly will impede<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2076.942s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This will greatly impede the concerns and the issues, whether it be for parks, historical pieces of property, low income housing, whatever the decision might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2086.672s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Plus the fact, I believe, that they're paying somebody approximately $65,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2088.814s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. Pender, can I see that card?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2090.136s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2098.801s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe approximately right now somebody's getting paid, I believe if I understood when this came out a couple of months ago, somebody's gonna be paid approximately $65,000, $62,000, $149,000, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2106.926s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So we've collected $1,242,974.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2114.811s">[Robert Penta]</a>: from the Medford taxpayers in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2117.195s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But all you're getting back from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is approximately $180,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2119.918s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2122.462s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's not the way this was supposed to be going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2124.525s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And now with more people coming on board, there's now 176 people applying for these monies from the Commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2133.054s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and having to go to the Registry of Deeds to double increase the taxes for municipal liens and for deed stamps that goes on our recordings, that's not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2144.824s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Just to meet the bare bones minimum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2147.826s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This year it's only 14%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2149.147s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was reported in the local press earlier this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2151.93s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You call the state house, they'll tell you the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2154.412s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you call, for which I had a long extensive conversation with the people in Boston, is call the CPA,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2162.727s">[Robert Penta]</a>: in Boston, their research people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2166.89s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is not, this is not to say I or anyone opposed to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2172.415s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What I'm opposed to is the inequity that this is now presented here within our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2177.399s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this inequity is not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2179.601s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because people are believing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2181.795s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you're only given $180,000 back on the $1.24 million, well, all we're asking to do is to put this on hold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2189.617s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Metro taxpayers do not have to pay for this until such time that the Commonwealth meets its obligation for the purposes of giving the reimbursement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2197.859s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what sold this program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2199.719s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what people voted for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2201.179s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's what they believed that they were getting, a match from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2204.78s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And unfortunately, it's not existing, and it's not there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2208.587s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That should have been told, that should have been explained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2210.347s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think, Mr. Clerk, you can attest to the fact over 1,200 people never turned their ballot over in 2015 to vote yes or no on the question itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2218.73s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So whether the people were not informed properly when they went to vote, or they just didn't want to vote, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2224.331s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But that's an awful lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2225.611s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I just think it takes into the serious consideration of today, hard times, people, water connectivity fee, water and sewer taxes, your tax rate keeps going up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2236.727s">[Robert Penta]</a>: new police station, new fire station, a library.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2240.651s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where is this money coming from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2242.032s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's the most unfair way to go out and tax somebody right now on this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2246.776s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is a state issue for which people went on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2250.018s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe that this would be one way to at least mitigate until the Commonwealth of Mass gets its act together, either they're going to give the 100 percent back or they're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2259.067s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why should you deal with the idea that we'll—we guarantee 5 percent because that's what the law says?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2263.531s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, what's 5 percent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2264.652s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's meaningless.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2266.334s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That is stupid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2268.155s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm more than happy to answer any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2299.894s">[Robert Penta]</a>: With all due respect, Rick, I have a folder here, and if you want to, I'll go over it with you, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2306.003s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This first came across the city council in 1991, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2310.85s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And in 1991, when this came out, when it became part of its first proposal, I think the then-Method City Council<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2316.938s">[Robert Penta]</a>: did not want to entertain it at the time because they felt it was another tax on the people, unfairly hitting them without having a say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2324.565s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you only can put it in those four particular areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2327.027s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Right now, okay, the people voted for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2328.808s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We accept that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2329.469s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I got no problem with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2331.01s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But how do you continue to go forward and tax the people when you're not even getting the money back?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2335.294s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're not even getting 50% of it back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2336.275s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're only getting 14.5% of the money back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2337.776s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's totally unfair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2342.32s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you go to these other cities and towns and you talk to them like I have, a lot of them are not realizing it until you go in there and you start reading the information that they have there and how it's broken down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2351.912s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I got volumes on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2353.854s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't sit home and read this for my health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2355.716s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm concerned about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2356.958s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it's an end run on Proposition 2.5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2359.041s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you continue to tax the people,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2361.845s">[Robert Penta]</a>: at the way you're going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2363.305s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is an alternative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2365.066s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a legitimate alternative that a city and town can pose, and until such time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2370.206s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this is only good for five years, remember that, because the first year that you voted for was 15 to 16, and you had to get those numbers together, so you're not getting that money until 17.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2379.528s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the city method's only gonna get it for four of the five years on the CPA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2383.729s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then if it goes automatically after that, it'll be every year on and after that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2387.509s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But what I'm saying is at the end of the fifth year, Rick,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2391.137s">[Robert Penta]</a>: the option would be that it ends, it becomes part of sunset legislation, and if the community wants to do it again, they put it on the ballot, like they did the first time, and the people can vote it up, or they can vote it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2550.817s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what I'm asking here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2552.077s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Motion to sever the papers, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2554.217s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, what are the motions before us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2577.83s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. Chase, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2586.992s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You could go through the state delegation, but you also could go through your local legislative body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2591.354s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's why I said a local home will petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2593.355s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'd like to make one correction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2594.356s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I said 1991.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2594.956s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was 2001 when this first came up in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2599.148s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And from 2001, 2002, which was the first year, to 2007, the first five years, first six years, 100% went back to cities and towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2608.215s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But they started off at 34, and then they went to 113 cities and towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2612.738s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The next year, from 2008 going forward, you went from 127, now up to 176, and it's been downhill ever since.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2620.563s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And again, we're just looking at equity, something that's fair to the Medford taxpayer,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2627.309s">[Robert Penta]</a>: especially the one that doesn't realize they're not getting it, that the state is not matching the money, as they said, and that's the term that they used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2634.312s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They were in Brooklyn when they sent it out, way back when.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2636.993s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It broke down all the cities and towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2639.294s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And like I said, I would just be asking respectfully that the council either forward this to the city solicitor and ask him if this could be done, and if not, then we go to the second row asking our state legislature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2683.353s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Right in the letter it designates both sections of the law section to amend section 16a and section 16b of the sections 4 to 7 sections 3 to 7 of chapter 44 which this city accepted when they voted for the for the act in 2015.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2703.718s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The legality of the law or if he would prepare legally a home rule petition that could be forwarded to our state legislators for the purposes of, again, this is not repealing it or getting rid of it, just to amend what's there until such time that the Commonwealth<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2723.489s">[Robert Penta]</a>: figures out how to give us the 100% back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2729.071s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's part of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2733.573s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, no, that's part of the proposal, not now, not doing it right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2738.474s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Filing the piece of legislation that would allow cities and towns through their local legislative body to hold back collecting until 100% and then the second part would be if this were to be accepted and voted upon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2939.699s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you read the last sentence of my paragraph, the intent of this home rule, local option petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2945.144s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a local option petition filed if the city of Medford feels that they would like to go forward as a local option petition for which the people would have a chance to vote on it, so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2956.535s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If they don't have that option,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2958.197s">[Robert Penta]</a>: than the local option, then we would take it to the legislature and have them file it for whatever the purposes might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2963.823s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm presenting it because I really think it's sort of like unfair to tax these people, to tax our citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2971.131s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I said in 2013, $25 million was taken out of the surplus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2973.513s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In 2014, $11.4 million was taken out of the state surplus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2980.18s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And in 2015, $10 million was taken out of the state surplus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2983.764s">[Robert Penta]</a>: From 2016 forward, there's been no surplus and no money to be taken out, and all that's happening is people are being taxed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2990.79s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Unfairly being taxed for something that they're not getting their money back on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2994.674s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's like you going to the store and buying a new suit, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=2999.458s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And they said it's $199, you go there, it's $300 because they didn't tell you about all the other incidentals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3004.863s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3005.863s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All we're asking for is equity, fairness to this whole thing, and having an opportunity just to present it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3011.505s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Again, this is not to kill it, to squash it, or anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3014.146s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's just to bring equity until such time that the Commonwealth can prove, can prove.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3018.348s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Councilor Marks, you just said it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3020.409s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You spoke to someone up there, and they said they created something, they can't control it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3025.13s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a monster that's out of control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3026.931s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But unfortunately, the ratepayers, the taxpayers, are paying for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3030.572s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3031.372s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't believe that that is fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3148.701s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So is Councilor Knight saying it's okay to tax the people without getting the adjust?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3153.002s">[Robert Penta]</a>: redemption for why they voted for this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3174.175s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is Councilor Knight alleging that I'm spewing false information and that my statistics are wrong, that we're only getting 14%?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3179.48s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay, 14.555%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3183.403s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, I think you go back and listen to what he said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3185.746s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why don't you go back and listen to it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3192.17s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I just can't believe that a board would want to continuously tax people in this room, in this community, knowing that it's wrong because the Commonwealth is not at least meeting its obligation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3204.478s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They can't even get to 50%, never mind 15%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3208.52s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's just wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3216.683s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Rick, it's right there on the back of the card.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3219.644s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It says matching funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3275.965s">[Robert Penta]</a>: 2015, we voted, it was 29%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3276.866s">[Robert Penta]</a>: 29%, oh gosh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3278.487s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then I think it went down to 18, now it's 14, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3281.188s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yeah, it went down to 20, and now we're down to 14.5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3786.585s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The letter that you wrote from the gentleman from the CPA incorrectly states that this was a petition to apply to all cities and towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3792.568s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3793.993s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that basically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3797.876s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Apparently you didn't translate it properly, or you didn't understand it properly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3803.679s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But apparently it was wrong because I don't want anyone to be misled to think that I'm asking this for all cities and towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=3809.503s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was just for the city of Medford, a local community home rule petition option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=4019.059s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So there's no appetite here to send this to the city solicitor for the purposes of reviewing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=4024.741s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So what we're saying is just keep taxing the people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16801.449s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Number two, we had Mr. Brown come up here and talk about the father of this producer's agreement and the demarcation for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16810.157s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Have you been quarry checked?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16812.68s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Have you passed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16814.161s">[Robert Penta]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16815.382s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He speaks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16817.744s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16818.965s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The question becomes this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16821.268s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He's running the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16822.329s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He's quarry checked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16823.65s">[Robert Penta]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16826.633s">[Robert Penta]</a>: cities and towns, they don't have this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16828.674s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the question that it boils down to, if in fact, as the superintendent alluded to, these are unsupervised contact with students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16840.238s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Councilor Farquhar, you mentioned the question when we were doing the LED lights for the Andrews School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16846.64s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think the comment was that the second shift of the people in the building, they will be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16854.112s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if we're going to follow this train of thought, maybe you or the council should get a notice that who the people were, and were they query checked, and did they pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16863.819s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Just making the comment is one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16866.38s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the superintendent is absolutely right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16869.082s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You guys up here tonight, you shouldn't even be here because you haven't been query checked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16873.745s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is public access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16875.006s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is a Medford City Council meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16877.408s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's public access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16878.548s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The people can see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16879.789s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They can come in and they can talk the same way you can too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16884.481s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you've got to follow the same rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16887.543s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You, in essence, are producing your own show, which is the Medford City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16893.166s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now when you talk about, I think it's section, I believe it's number five, it says here that the producer acknowledges that there's a possibility that the producer will have direct and unsupervised contact with children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16907.374s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay, we'll give you a grant to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16910.468s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if I never walk into this building and I send you something through the mail to have it played, are you going to play it without having the car rechecked?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16921.919s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Can you answer that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16922.58s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you can't answer it, just say yes or no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16926.004s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I can't answer it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16926.664s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would have to go back to the city and ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16930.382s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's where the problem begins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16932.343s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have to go back to the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16934.064s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Here's the gentleman who's the manager of the station, and these questions should be all readily available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16938.966s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, there are things on here that talk about what can and cannot be played.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16943.808s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It talks about, in section 4D, materials that contain bias, motivated threats, intimidation, and coercion that interfere with a person's civil rights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16956.287s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, I can attest to the fact that I was a product of the former, Channel 3.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16962.851s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They did all of those things to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16966.092s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And now they're putting it in here, and I'm glad to see that it's in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16969.274s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because there's a civil rights section in here for the violation of any of those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16973.196s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And there's also a section here as it relates to what can and cannot be shown, as it relates to obscenities and without getting into the graphics of each and every one of the words.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16983.797s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There I think you might have an issue as it relates to constitutional rights as to when and how it can be spoken and what time of the program, morning, noon, and night, it can be played.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16995.547s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's also a section here regarding you or anyone who's listening or anyone in this audience who decides to become a producer by giving something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17009.027s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you give them something and they lose it, they destroy it or what have you, they're not responsible unless it was gross negligence on their part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17017.712s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if you were to borrow something from Channel 3 and there was something wrong and some damage took place, you would be culpably liable financially and otherwise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17029.498s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what this agreement says, Mr. Bennett.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17037.623s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I really think what you really need to ask is, there are some people who might want to just come in and say, there's a community section in here on cable television.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17048.429s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They may want to come in, I don't know what the terminology might be, they may want to show a birthday party, or they may want to show a wedding, or whatever it may be, just a one-shot deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17057.595s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And for that one-shot deal, and coming in that entrance over there, not coming in the non-school hours,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17063.255s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're telling that person, call them a producer, that they have to get a Corby check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17068.299s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A cousin of mine, you're absolutely right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17069.921s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You really need to know the genesis behind this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17071.782s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No city in town around this has this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17074.885s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is crazy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17076.386s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is not making any sense at all, is to go through this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17079.649s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is going to really stifle free speech.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17082.071s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is going to stifle your election coming up right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17085.732s">[Robert Penta]</a>: for reelection and any new candidate running, is you're going to have to get a corporate check to walk into that room, submit a tape, whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17094.227s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now you think about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17096.17s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've served all these years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17099.019s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And now you have to submit a quarterly check to get into your local public access channel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17103.983s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It makes no sense at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17105.764s">[Robert Penta]</a>: To me, I think it's an administrative discrimination point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17109.246s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't think the administration has the right to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17112.469s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think the city solicitor needs to come and present his argument before you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17117.392s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the only person that can change this, the only person that can change this,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17130.554s">[Robert Penta]</a>: you are on public access right now, and you guys and gals are producers because you're making this show, you're producing your comments, you're producing your votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17140.941s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But to get over on that other side of the room and to be there and have your voice heard as an announcement, you'd have to become a producer, you'd have to come and get a Corby check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17149.587s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that'll stifle free speech and free access in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17154.671s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=17156.172s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18394.439s">[Robert Penta]</a>: election, we'll have to have a query check or not, because you just said you're going to invite them in over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18399.942s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's going to be required of a candidate running for office incumbent newcomer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18407.306s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Uh, yes, I believe it will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18411.068s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So tonight we had you folks up here with your public access and we have right down<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18426.082s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this is where the situation is going to become really sticky and technical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18431.184s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why did Corby check?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18432.144s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No other city in town around this has it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18434.185s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you look at their applications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18437.106s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, you guys in Bureau, you're candidates as well as candidates for re-election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18441.827s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're all going to have to have a Corby check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18445.289s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I disagree with you for 24 hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18448.43s">[Robert Penta]</a>: For the time being.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14608.228s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name's Robert Pentez, Zero Summit, Rowan-Benton Mass, former member of this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14612.949s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When we talk about security, again, you can walk into this building tonight, there's no security here at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14617.97s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is not the first time this has happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14620.011s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I know it's been a pet peeve of Councilman Locke's relative to the security of the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14624.151s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So that's number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14625.012s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Number two, we had Mr. Brown come up here and talk about the father of this producer's agreement, the demarcation bond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14633.634s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Have you been query checked?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14636.113s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Did you pass?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14637.633s">[Robert Penta]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14638.834s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He speaks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14641.214s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14642.434s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The question becomes this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14644.735s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He's running the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14645.775s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He's corporate checked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14647.115s">[Robert Penta]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14648.236s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I think if you ask the question of surrounding cities and towns, they don't have this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14652.157s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the question boils down to, if in fact, as the superintendent alluded to, these are unsupervised contact with students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14664.17s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Councilor Falco, you mentioned the question when we were doing the LED lights for the Andrews School, and I think the comment was that the second shift of the people in the building, they will become quarry checked, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14677.573s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if we're going to follow this train of thought, maybe you or the council should get a notice that who the people were and were they quarry checked and did they pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14686.819s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, just making the comment is one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14692.56s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You guys up here tonight, you shouldn't even be here because you haven't been query checked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14697.261s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is public access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14698.522s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is a Medford City Council meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14700.902s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's public access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14702.043s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The people can see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14703.303s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They can come in and they can talk the same way you can, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14708.004s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you've got to follow the same rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14710.985s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You, in essence, are producing your own show, which is the Medford City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14716.627s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now when you talk about, I think it's section, I believe it's number five, it says here that the producer acknowledges that there's a possibility that the producer will have direct and unsupervised contact with children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14730.839s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay, we'll give you a grant to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14733.962s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if I never walk into this building and I send you something through the mail to have it played, are you gonna play it without having the quarry checked?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14749.456s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If I can't answer it, I would have to go back to the city and ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14753.697s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's where the problem begins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14755.818s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have to go back to the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14757.538s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Here's the gentleman who's the manager of the station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14759.918s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And these questions should be all readily available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14762.439s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, there are things on here that talk about what can and cannot be played.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14767.28s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It talks about, in section 4D, materials that contain bias, motivated threats, intimidation, and coercion that interfere with a person's civil rights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14779.763s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, I can attest to the fact that I was a product of the former Channel 3.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14786.766s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They did all those things to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14789.567s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And now they're putting it in here, and I'm glad to see that it's in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14792.749s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because there's a civil rights section in here for the violation of any of those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14796.67s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And there's also a section here as it relates to what can and cannot be shown, as it relates to obscenities, and without getting into the graphics of each and every one of the words.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14807.276s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There I think you might have an issue as it relates to constitutional rights as to when and how it can be spoken and what time of the program, morning, noon, and night, it can be played.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14819.025s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's also a section here regarding you or anyone who's listening or anyone in this audience who decides to become a producer by giving something to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14832.502s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you give them something and they lose it, they destroy it, or what have you, they're not responsible unless it was gross negligence on their part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14841.187s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if you were to borrow something from Channel 3 and there was something wrong and some damage took place, you would be culpably liable financially and otherwise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14852.974s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what this agreement says, Mr. Bennett.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14861.083s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I really think what you really need to ask is, there are some people who might want to just come in and say, there's a community section in here on cable television.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14871.896s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They may want to come in and, I don't know what the terminology might be, they may want to show a birthday party, or they may want to show a wedding, or whatever, just a one-shot deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14881.07s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And for that one shot deal, and coming in that entrance over there, not coming in at non-school hours, you're telling that person, call them a producer, that they have to get a Corby check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14891.718s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now Councilor Marks, you're absolutely right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14893.399s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You really need to know the genesis behind this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14895.24s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No city and town around this has this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14898.363s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is crazy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14899.844s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is not making any sense at all as to go through this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14902.906s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because this is going to really stifle free speech.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14905.548s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is going to stifle your election coming up right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14909.195s">[Robert Penta]</a>: for reelection and any new candidate running, is you're going to have to get a carving check to walk into that room, submit a tape, whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14917.687s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, you think about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14919.63s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've served all these years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14922.482s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And now you have to submit a Corby check to get into your local public access channel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14927.465s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It makes no sense at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14929.227s">[Robert Penta]</a>: To me, I think it's an administrative discrimination point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14932.729s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't think the administration has the right to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14935.931s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think the city solicitor needs to come and present his argument before you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14940.854s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the only person that can change this, the only person that can change this is the issuing authority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14946.498s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And who is the issuing authority?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14948.139s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's the mayor of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14953.93s">[Robert Penta]</a>: because you are on public access right now and you guys and gals are producers because you're making this show, you're producing your comments, you're producing your votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14964.418s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But to get over on that other side of the room and to be there and have your voice heard as an announcement, you'd have to become a producer, you'd have to come and get a quarry check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14973.045s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that'll stifle free speech and free access in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14978.129s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14979.63s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16219.555s">[Robert Penta]</a>: have a quarry check or not?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16220.796s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because you just said you were going to invite the men over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16222.757s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is that going to be required of a candidate running for office?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16226.98s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Incumbent, newcomer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16231.803s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yes, I believe it will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16234.465s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So tonight we had you folks up here with your public access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16239.228s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And we had, right down the hall, we had the band playing, practicing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16244.092s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You followed the rules, and you guys were all in violation tonight because you didn't have a quarry check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16249.48s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this is where the situation is going to become really sticky and technical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16254.604s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why the quarry check?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16255.565s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No other city in town around this has it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16257.607s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you look at their applications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16260.529s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, you guys in Bureau, you're candidates as well as candidates for re-election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16265.253s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're all going to have to have a quarry check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16268.715s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I disagree with you for 24 hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16271.878s">[Robert Penta]</a>: For the time being.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=16274.084s">[Robert Penta]</a>: August 1st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=17004.414s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, it was my intent to address this council on Tuesday, July 18th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=17011.096s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is now Wednesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=17013.416s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Councilor Dello Russo is tired, he wants to go home, so I'd like to table this to our August meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1816.12s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Pintus, Arrow Summit Road, Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1818.742s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm a member of the Saugus body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1820.744s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's a couple of things here that would disturb me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1824.087s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The first one goes on to personnel under the Office of Community Development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1827.75s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, this city is in desperate need<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1830.05s">[Robert Penta]</a>: of having good qualified people for the purposes of bringing development here into this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1835.432s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Unfortunately, the city does not have a professional grant writer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1838.773s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It does not have any extra people in that particular office upstairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1843.295s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is what we heard two years ago when this administration was running.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1846.476s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We were going to boast that particular office with personnel that could bring us to some type of competition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1852.298s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Our sister city of Somerville<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1853.928s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe it's either 13 or 14 people in their OCD.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1857.09s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Malden, a smaller city, equal size, has more people than we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1860.873s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But it's a telling story that if you can have two departments that have $100,000<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1867.605s">[Robert Penta]</a>: as this particular department has, and then you can go to the building department, who has a $57,000 personnel line item in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1874.99s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That really tells the story to me that there is absolutely something wrong, and nothing has taken place here over the last two years to bring in good, qualified people, if, in fact, the money is there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1886.018s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, $100,000 just doesn't get there at the end of the year, and neither does $50,000 just get there during the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1892.342s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if I remember correctly, I believe this council some six months ago asked for an interim report as it related to department personnel and expenses, which is obviously you never got.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1903.275s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Contrary to the issue on fire and ice, where the comment was made that you have to raise it on the tax recap, I believe with our approximately $9 million in free cash,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1912.97s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Years in the past, we have paid deficits off with our free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1918.153s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I believe you do have an option there without getting into your recap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1921.854s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And at the same time, I would seriously question another portion of this transfer of why are you transferring $100,000 from the Office of Community Development, which is supposed to be the brainchild of bringing new business into this community, development into this community, meeting with business owners in this community,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1941.244s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and being the partner in the arm with the Chamber of Commerce, for which it doesn't seem to seem the light of day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1946.889s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So, Mr. President, I would suggest and I would hope that some member of the City Council would reflect upon that matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1953.335s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=1954.116s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=2952.28s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Name and address for the record please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=2953.34s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford Mass, former member of this ward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=2957.062s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm glad to see this on the agenda this week because apparently last week when I introduced this before the council as to where this money went, apparently the mayor's office felt necessary to respond to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=2967.28s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let's go back with a little bit of history here on October 7th, 2014, when the mayor had the press release indicating that the contract had been signed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=2976.443s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as a result of what took place in September 20th of 2014, with a meeting with the business community and of their concerns at that particular point in time, the mayor made an addendum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=2987.446s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He made an addendum to the contract that was signed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=2989.947s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And he stated, after deliberating and discussing concerns raised by the business community,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=2995.279s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The mayor is recommending the following changes to the signed contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=2999.042s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In one of the signed contracts, it was point number three, it says, I recommend $250,000 on the revenue generated on a yearly, on a yearly basis to be deducted, dedicated, excuse me, to the business district improvements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3014.374s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That was his first comment as it relates to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3017.256s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then on December 23rd, 2014, then budget director Burke,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3023.074s">[Robert Penta]</a>: speaking on behalf of the mayor, issued a press release indicating press highlights of the contract that was signed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3029.896s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And once again, she states in her press highlights that $250,000 annually will be subject to appropriations to the district improvements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3038.779s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We know that there are five districts, Mr. President, as you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3042.941s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then we continue on to December 18th of 2015.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3047.17s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You went from December of 2014, and now you're going to December of 2015, for which the mayor, on his comment to the Medford City Council on December 18th, stated that I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body appropriate the sum of $250,000 for the purposes of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3067.541s">[Robert Penta]</a>: the five districts regarding to the Park Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3070.343s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This memorandum is a result of what took place during the past year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3075.005s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you have one full year, which is 2015, as Councilmember Mox has alluded to, if we go on an annual basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3081.829s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then we go to January 28th of 2016.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3086.331s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, then Budget Director Burke is the mayor, and this is her comment as it relates to us being the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3093.315s">[Robert Penta]</a>: She states the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3095.354s">[Robert Penta]</a>: After signing a 10-year contract for the program, McGlynn said $250,000 of the city's annual revenue would be used for improvements in the business district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3104.557s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The prior mayor made a commitment to that, Burke said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3107.517s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When we initially rolled it out, my interpretation was that that would be above and beyond the fixed amount that we collected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3114.579s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I certainly think that the district needs enhancements, Burke continued.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3119.301s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So we'll be working for them to determine what type of monies they need going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3125.658s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have commitments from the prior Mayor McGlynn to the present Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3129.965s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now if you wanna take on fiscal years 15 and go from January to December, you're into two years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3135.188s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you wanna go into fiscal years June to July, I mean June to July, yeah, June to July, you're into two fiscal years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3142.691s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So no matter how you cut it, it's $100,000 that should be going back to the districts, not 250 or 50,000 each.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3149.995s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think that is a real big concern because with $100,000 and you're going into the third year right now, you're gonna be looking at either next June<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3159.019s">[Robert Penta]</a>: or next December as being into the third year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3161.64s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So to make the discussion on what the needs might be is one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3166.023s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the real cash that should be going back to these departments, strike that, to these districts within the city, that's where it should be at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3173.407s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This isn't me making it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3174.848s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is all part of the official documents that make up this, plus another packet of internal documents that basically reflect upon the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3182.292s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you doubt what I'm saying, go back and check your own records and check the meetings that took place<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3186.754s">[Robert Penta]</a>: between the Medford City Council and the business districts that came down there who were upset because they were not involved in the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3193.637s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's why Mayor McGlynn at the time changed it in September of 2014 when he signed the contract in October of 2014 to include that on an annual basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3204.743s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3205.343s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5624.518s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert Pentez, Zero Summit Road, Medford Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5626.658s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The interesting part about this budget goes back to October or November of last year and January of this past year regarding the mayor's original state of the city address, where she talked about she had incorporated a liaison officer between her office<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5642.055s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and this council, and the interesting part about this whole thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5645.297s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, Mr. President, I don't know if I should say this, but I am.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5649.46s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, because I'm at the podium, Councilor Knight and Councilor Dello Russo like to take this opportunity from walking away and shirking their responsibility to listen to whoever the person is at this podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5659.706s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's a complete disrespect to this councilor and to the taxpayers of this community for which they're getting paid $30,000 each, which is $60,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5667.954s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if anybody is watching, I would hope that they do not vote for Mr. Knight or Mr. Dello Russo, because they show complete disrespect to people at this podium, including a former member of this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5679.986s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Therefore, as I said before and I will repeat it, this council has never had the opportunity to sit down with this man to go to every single one of you, seven of you, one at a time, to find out what you would like to see in this budget as your particular project, over and beyond her particular projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5695.722s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It doesn't exist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5696.503s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It doesn't happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5697.744s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is not a transparent<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5700.026s">[Robert Penta]</a>: administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5700.766s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a fake administration of telling things that happen that don't happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5706.469s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's as fake as a nine dollar bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5708.851s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the unfortunate part is that you seven members, all of you, especially the one that support her, she's making complete fools out of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5716.475s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're making yourself look like a bunch of clowns because you've never held her feet to the fire once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5720.917s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this is the year that it should have been done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5723.098s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Dr. Stirella is absolutely right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5725.24s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As an elderly taxpayer in this community, he has taken the time to understand and at least manage, through this particular budget, the needs of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5734.51s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you have more building permits going out, if you have more construction coming in, and you have more money coming in, and you continuously keep taxing,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5742.718s">[Robert Penta]</a>: the Medford taxpayers, over and beyond, then they have the connectivity tax, surpluses in the water and sewer account for which you have no major projects going on, $9 million in thereabouts of the free cash account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5754.704s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where are the preferences taking place?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5757.265s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Councilor Marks, you alluded to the fact of the gear, the washing machine gear, which goes back to February of this past year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5764.469s">[Robert Penta]</a>: $100,000 in the Office of Community Development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5766.93s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've been begging for more people in that office to help you out here in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5771.612s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We could go through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5772.393s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm not going to go through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5773.773s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Sitting behind me over here are four ladies that work in the mayor's office that make in excess of $400,000 a year that Medford taxpayers are paying for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5784.178s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And none of you will have the opportunity to sit down and to get your particular issue in this particular budget to show an act of conciliation, an act of remediation, and more importantly, an act of incorporation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5796.409s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It doesn't exist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5797.85s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's why there are so many people running for city council, and that's why there are so many people running for mayor, because the people in this community are dissatisfied as to what's going on in this particular building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5809.42s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're running it as a closed shop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5811.662s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And every single one of you should be ashamed of yourself if you'll allow this to continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5815.844s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5817.105s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2127.493s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Name and address to the record please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2131.434s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Pentez here of Summit Road, Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2134.075s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm a member of the circus party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2136.076s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's a couple of things here that would disturb me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2139.477s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The first one goes on to personnel under the office of community development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2143.158s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, this city is in desperate need of having good qualified people for the purposes of bringing development here into this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2150.86s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Unfortunately, the city does not have a professional grant writer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2154.185s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It does not have any extra people in that particular office upstairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2158.689s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is what we heard two years ago when this administration was running.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2161.891s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We were going to boast that particular office with personnel that could bring us to some type of competition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2167.716s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Our sister city of Somerville, I believe, has either 13 or 14 people in their OCD.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2172.499s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Malden, a smaller city, equal size, has more people than we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2176.282s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But it's a telling story that if you can have two departments that have $100,000<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2183.016s">[Robert Penta]</a>: as this particular department has, and then you can go to the building department who has a $57,000 personnel line item in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2190.403s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That really tells the story to me that there is absolutely something wrong, and nothing has taken place here over the last two years to bring in good, qualified people if, in fact, the money is there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2201.433s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, $100,000 just doesn't get there at the end of the year, and neither does $50,000 just get there during the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2207.738s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if I remember correctly, I believe this council, some six months ago, asked for an interim report as it related to department personnel and expenses, which is obviously you never got.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2218.668s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Contrary to the issue on fire and ice, where the comment was made that you have to raise it on the tax recap, I believe with our approximately $9 million in free cash,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2228.381s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Years in the past, we have paid deficits off with our free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2233.57s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I believe you do have an option there, without getting into your recap, and at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2238.65s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would seriously question another portion of this transfer of why are you transferring $100,000 from the Office of Community Development, which is supposed to be the brainchild of bringing new business into this community, development into this community, meeting with business owners in this community, and being the partner in the arm with the Chamber of Commerce for which it doesn't seem to seem the light of day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2262.324s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So, Mr. President, I would suggest and I would hope that some member of the City Council would reflect upon that matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2268.729s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=2269.509s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3267.67s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Name and address of the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3268.75s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert Pentez, Zero Summit Road, Medford Mass, former member of this ward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3272.471s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm glad to see this on the agenda this week because apparently last week when I introduced this before the council as to where this money went, apparently the mayor's office felt necessary to respond to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3282.732s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let's go back with a little bit of history here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3284.513s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On October 7th, 2014,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3287.436s">[Robert Penta]</a>: when the mayor had the press release indicating that the contract had been signed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3291.898s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as a result of what took place on September 20th of 2014, with a meeting with the business community and of their concerns at that particular point in time, the mayor made an addendum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3302.901s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He made an addendum to the contract that was signed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3305.422s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And he stated, after deliberating and discussing concerns raised by the business community, the mayor is recommending the following changes<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3313.288s">[Robert Penta]</a>: to the signed contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3314.488s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In one of the signed contracts, it was point number three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3317.249s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It says, I recommend $250,000 on the revenue generated on a yearly basis to be dedicated to the business district improvements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3329.814s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That was his first comment as it relates to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3332.695s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then on December 23, 2014, then budget director Burke,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3338.498s">[Robert Penta]</a>: speaking on behalf of the mayor, issued a press release indicating press highlights of the contract that was signed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3345.319s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And once again, she states in her press highlights that $250,000 annually will be subject to appropriations to the district improvements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3354.221s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We know that there are five districts, Mr. President, as you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3358.382s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then we continue on to December 18th of 2015.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3362.617s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You went from December of 2014, and now you're going to December of 2015, for which the mayor, on his comment to the Medford City Council on December 18th, stated that I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body appropriate the sum of $250,000 for the purposes of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3382.985s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The five districts regarding to the Park Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3385.787s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This memorandum is a result of what took place during the past year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3390.431s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you have one full year, which is 2015, as Councilmember Mox has alluded to, if we go on an annual basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3397.216s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then we go to January 28th of 2016.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3401.719s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, then Budget Director Burke is the mayor, and this is her comment as it relates to us being the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3408.704s">[Robert Penta]</a>: She states the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3410.748s">[Robert Penta]</a>: After signing a 10-year contract for the program, McGlynn said $250,000 of the city's annual revenue would be used for improvements in the business district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3419.95s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The prior man made a commitment to that, Burke said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3422.91s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When we initially rolled it out, my interpretation was that that would be above and beyond the fixed amount that we collected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3429.971s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I certainly think that the district needs enhancements, Burke continued.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3434.692s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So we'll be working for them to determine what type of monies they need going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3441.035s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have commitments from the prior Mayor McGlynn to the present Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3445.355s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, if you want to take on fiscal years 15 and go from January to December, you're into two years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3450.578s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you want to go into fiscal years June to July, I mean June to July, yeah, June to July, you're into two fiscal years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3458.083s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So no matter how you cut it, it's $100,000 that should be going back to the districts, not $250,000 or $50,000 each.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3465.387s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think that is a real big concern because with $100,000 and you're going into the third year right now, you're going to be looking at either next June<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3474.413s">[Robert Penta]</a>: or next December as being into the third year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3477.035s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So to make a discussion on what the needs might be is one thing, but the real cash that should be going back to these departments, strike that, to these districts within the city, that's where it should be at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3488.885s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This isn't me making it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3490.306s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is all part of the official documents that make up this, plus another packet of internal documents that basically reflect upon the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3497.752s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you doubt what I'm saying, go back and check your own records and check the meetings that took place<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3502.215s">[Robert Penta]</a>: between the Medford City Council and the business districts that came down there who were upset because they were not involved in the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3509.056s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's why Mayor McGlynn at the time changed it in September of 2014 when he signed the contract in October of 2014 to include that on an annual basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3520.158s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=3520.758s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=5940.064s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=5942.224s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The interesting part about this budget goes back to October or November of last year in January of this past year regarding the mayor's original state of the city address, where she talked about she had incorporated a liaison officer between her office<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=5957.618s">[Robert Penta]</a>: in this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=5959.039s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the interesting part about this whole thing, you know, Mr. President, um, I don't know if I should say this, but I am, you know, because I'm at the podium, Councilor Knight and Councilor Dello Russo like to take this opportunity from walking away and shirking their responsibility to listen to whoever the person is at this podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=5975.268s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's a complete disrespect to this councilor and to the taxpayers of this community, for which they're getting paid $30,000 each, which is $60,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=5983.511s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if anybody is watching, I would hope that they do not vote for Mr. Knight or Mr. Dello Russo, because they show complete disrespect to people at this podium, including a former member of this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=5995.495s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Therefore, as I said before and I will repeat it, this council has never had the opportunity to sit down with this mayor to go to every single one of you, seven of you, one at a time, to find out what you would like to see in this budget as your particular project, over and beyond her particular projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=6011.22s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It doesn't exist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=6012.02s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It doesn't happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=6013.26s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is not a transparent<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=6015.541s">[Robert Penta]</a>: administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=6016.281s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a fake administration of telling things that happen that don't happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=6021.983s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's as fake as a nine dollar bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=6024.363s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the unfortunate part is that you seven members, all of you, especially the one that support her, she's making complete fools out of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=6032.005s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're making yourself look like a bunch of clowns because you've never held her feet to the fire once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=6036.426s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this is the year that it should have been done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=6038.627s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Dr. Stirella is absolutely right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=6040.768s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As an elderly taxpayer in this community, he has taken the time to understand and at least manage, through this particular budget, the needs of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=6050.011s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you have more building permits going out, if you have more construction coming in, and you have more money coming in, and you continuously keep taxing,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=6058.233s">[Robert Penta]</a>: the Medford taxpayers over and beyond, then they have the connectivity tax, surpluses in the water and sewer account for which you have no major projects going on, $9 million in thereabouts of the free cash account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=6070.301s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where are the preferences taking place?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=6072.863s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Councilman Marks, you alluded to the fact of the gear, the washing machine gear, which goes back to February of this past year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=6080.048s">[Robert Penta]</a>: $100,000 in the Office of Community Development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=6082.51s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've been begging for more people in that office to help you out here in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=6087.193s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We could go through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=6087.973s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm not going to go through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=6089.354s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Sitting behind me over here are four ladies that work in the mayor's office that make in excess of $400,000 a year that Medford taxpayers are paying for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=6099.721s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And none of you will have the opportunity to sit down and to get your particular issue in this particular budget to show an act of conciliation, an act of remediation, and more importantly, an act of incorporation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=6111.925s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It doesn't exist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=6113.366s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's why there are so many people running for city council, and that's why there are so many people running for mayor, because the people in this community are dissatisfied as to what's going on in this particular building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=6124.949s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're running it as a closed shop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=6127.19s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And every single one of you should be ashamed of yourself if you'll allow this to continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=6131.372s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=6132.612s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1943.464s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Penter, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1947.147s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm a member of this August body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1949.208s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I come here tonight on two very important issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1954.227s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that directly affect this Medford City Council and the taxpayers of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1959.091s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The first one is to address the issue of the CPA, the Community Preservation Act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1964.215s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As we know, when it was passed in November of 2015, it has a lifespan of five years from the date of its passage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1971.12s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's now going to be just about into its second year with three years to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1975.103s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The unfortunate part about this CPA is that at an election night some two years ago, almost 1,200 to 1,300 ballots<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1983.336s">[Robert Penta]</a>: were never acted upon, because a lot of people never turned the ballot over to vote for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1987.438s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So whether it was going to pass or not, nobody even knew.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1990.979s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Apparently, it did pass from those members that did vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=1994.2s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The unfortunate part about this particular act, and I'm going to draw the correlation to the connectivity fee, it's another tax being opposed upon the taxpayers of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2004.264s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But unfortunately, they're not getting that for which they voted for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2009.086s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The Enabling Act, which goes back to 2001 and 2002,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2013.835s">[Robert Penta]</a>: addressed itself through the years, right up until this past year, to the fact that whatever and however the population count takes place, and however the tax valuation on assessed pieces of property here in the city of Medford, as in all cities and towns, determines the dollar amount that will come back from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2032.466s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, we all know that for the past years, the Commonwealth has been having a tough time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2037.909s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So let's just go back to fiscal year 2013, the state gave back<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2042.969s">[Robert Penta]</a>: 52%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2043.029s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Fiscal year 2014, 31%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2044.37s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Fiscal year 2015, 29.7%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2044.93s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this present past fiscal year 2016, they're at 18%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2046.812s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So for every dollar that every taxpayer here in the city of Medford has given up as it relates to the assessed evaluation at the 1.5%, the state will give back approximately 18%, which is nowhere near the dollar for dollar of 100%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2073.249s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I've spoken to members up at the legislature, and I've spoken to other cities and towns, where they feel to some degree that the taxpayer is not getting their real bank for the buck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2082.897s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You guys and gals are into this thing on the second year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2085.799s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You still have no program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2087.401s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's still no designation where and how that money can be spent, whether it's for housing, affordable housing, parks and recreation, or historical values.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2098.67s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Those are the three primary things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2101.298s">[Robert Penta]</a>: at a minimum of each one of those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2103.539s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So what I did is I looked at the law and I found it on page, it's section 18.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2109.802s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Larry, he's not here when he comes back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2113.124s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think what I would want to do, and I'll pass one off for each of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2116.165s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The intent of what I'd like to have is to have you as a city council consider the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2121.168s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Since in fact the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is not paying back dollar for dollar as people<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2126.54s">[Robert Penta]</a>: have been led to believe because of the 158 cities and towns that now make up the CPA throughout the commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2133.706s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't think it's fair that we should keep paying, having our taxpayers pay their 1.5 share for the purposes of hopefully thinking they're going to get a match back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2144.656s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The proposal that I'm asking you as a council to do is to file a piece of legislation to amend<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2151.089s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Section 18, A and B. And in those two sections, they basically will say, if in fact the Commonwealth cannot meet its obligation of dollar for dollar for which the city of Medford at 1.5 is taxing their residents, then the city can suspend, by a vote of the city council, suspend any further collection of those taxes or that 1.5%, or you could also vote to reduce it down to 1%,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2179.379s">[Robert Penta]</a>: until further notice, until the Commonwealth meets its obligation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2182.942s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's the first part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2184.323s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the second part, and I think it's very important that it's understood, that if this city and this council wants to not renew the CPA after its fifth year, at present, the only way you can do it is it becomes automatically taking place unless the city council, by a vote, puts the question on the ballot and the people vote for it all over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2208.056s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My amendment to that portion states basically this, at the end of the fifth year, it automatically dies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2214.238s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If in fact, if in fact the people of this community and whoever the council might be at that time wishes to go forward and renew it again for another five years, then the question goes on the ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2225.121s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You are dealing with right now your second fiscal year on this CPA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2229.682s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't think anyone of you behind this rail have even been informed as to where and how that money is going to be spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2234.881s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And there are provisos in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2236.321s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a 12, it's a 12 page document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2238.602s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There are 18 sections to go with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2240.582s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And in those 18 sections, it's very important to understand and to read.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2243.983s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's a great latitude that up to a nine member board or a commission has with that money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2249.865s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you as a council haven't even been right into the picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2252.666s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No public meetings and hearings have been held to find out where and how that money can be spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2257.187s">[Robert Penta]</a>: While 30% can go to housing, historical and open space and recreational.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2262.482s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The remaining 70% can be likewise used for the same, if not similar, situations that CPA will approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2270.127s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think you folks really need to take a deep, hard look at this particular law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2274.489s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because as of July 1, as I said, once people start getting hit with a connectivity fee every other month, and then begin to realize that their 1.5%, which is in excess of $1 million, is being collected here at City Hall, and the state is not giving back the dollar for dollar, as people thought they did when they voted for this,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2291.747s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's two unfair taxes being placed upon taxpayers at the present time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2297.492s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The second thing I would like to talk about is the money that on October 7th, 2014, after many weeks of, excuse me, on October 7th in 2014, I don't know what's going on here, on October 7th,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2321.673s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On 2014, after the then Medford City Council was reviewing Park Medford's application before the city of Medford, and Mayor McGlynn at that point in time signed the contract on October 7th, 2014, five additional addendums, five additional addendums were included into that Park Medford contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2345.18s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the one that stands out is the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2346.86s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It says he's recommending $250,000<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2350.92s">[Robert Penta]</a>: of the revenue generated on a yearly basis to be dedicated to business district improvements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2356.941s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now that's a result of the mayor making the comment after deliberating and discussing concerns issued by many business people in the community, the mayor is recommending the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2368.403s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And he did that the same day he made that announcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2373.584s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On December 18th, 2015, the mayor sent out a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2378.995s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Notice to the members of the city council, which basically said in part, a representative of each business district will recommend to the mayor some proposed uses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2391.081s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I respectfully request and recommend that the sum of $250,000 be transferred from the sale of real estate to be used for improvements to the five business districts with kiosks as I recommended earlier this year, which would have been effective calendar year 2016.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2409.335s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now we go a little bit further and we go to December 23rd, 2014.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2415.799s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Once again, in the press release issued by the local press from the mayor's office, it states $250,000 annually would be subject to appropriation for district improvements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2426.146s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as a result of that, that came from then the mayor's secretary, Lisa Evangelista, and she was given that by then budget director, Stephanie Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2437.132s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then lastly,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2438.441s">[Robert Penta]</a>: we have on January 24th of 2016, once again, after a signing ceremony of a 10-year contract for the program, Mayor McGlynn said $250,000 of the city's annual revenue would be used for improvements to business districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2455.267s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is the catch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2456.707s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The prior mayor made a commitment to that, Burke said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2460.308s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When we initially rolled it out, my interpretation was that that would be about and beyond<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2465.627s">[Robert Penta]</a>: the fixed amount that we collected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2468.029s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, how could that be about and beyond when the mayor specifically said it would come out of your real estate account?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2475.153s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Each district right now is $100,000 behind in what they should have been getting for the past two years, inclusive of Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2483.45s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe as council members, you have a deep responsibility right now to get answers from this mayor as it relates to not only the $50,000 for each square, where is the money because that money should be designated in the real estate account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2499.13s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's unfair to the business districts in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2502.04s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is an election year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2503.021s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're going to see a lot of puffing going along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2505.062s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, we're going to do this and we're going to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2507.244s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, I don't think any of these districts have seen anything going on right now that makes them a lot better than they were when they first started when Park Medford came in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2515.009s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're talking about $500,000 that should be accounted for right now that should come out of that account sale of real estate for which the mayor indicated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2524.642s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You folks have not received one document from this administration telling you that that money would not be forthcoming and not be forthcoming from that account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2535.813s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I just think it's unfair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2537.554s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it's unfair to the taxpayers, the business people in this community, the Chamber of Commerce, who are all led to believe that that money would be forthcoming and to be there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2546.443s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, I would like to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2549.41s">[Robert Penta]</a>: ask that someone on the council, maybe all the council members ask the mayor, where is the money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2555.192s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When is it going to be forthcoming to the business districts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2558.053s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And how can we see it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2559.914s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the people of this community will have an understanding that this city keeps its word.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2565.176s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's just not political puffing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2569.057s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is that Mr. Um, I'd like to pass out the site and sections of the law for which we just talked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2576.279s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Could you give one to each one, including the clerk?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2578.315s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'd like to have you look at it, and in the July meeting, I'd like to come back and see what your thoughts are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2583.976s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, ratepayers in this community are paying an awful lot, not only for their taxes and their water bills, their sewer bills, now a connectivity fee, you know, and now we're looking at a CPA tax, that all intentions were good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2598.498s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think a lot of people would say if we were getting the 100 percent back from the Commonwealth, we'd be in good shape.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2604.559s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if it's only progressed for 18 percent of this year,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2608.291s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's just unfair to keep it in the Medford tax base.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2610.754s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Whether it's $50, $60, $70, $80 a year, that's not the point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2614.279s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's another tax, another tax that cannot be accounted for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2617.823s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this one comes from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2620.466s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So this would probably be easier for you folks to even deal with, because it's not even coming from the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2625.072s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'd be more than happy to answer any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2627.728s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I just think, you know, when you start looking at these things, it's election year, and walking the streets and talking to people all day long, this is what I hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2635.13s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why are we paying for these things?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2637.031s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why are we paying for a connectivity fee when we have $850,000 in a water and soil surplus account?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2642.913s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why are we paying for a CPA tax when we're not even getting 100% reimbursement?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2648.415s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it just doesn't make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2650.075s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And when you go into the business districts, they're just completely fed up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2653.396s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They just can't understand what's going on in this building here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2656.564s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's absolutely no communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2658.145s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's no transparency as to how and what money is to be spent around here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2663.467s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'd be more than happy to answer any question if anybody has it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2687.924s">[Robert Penta]</a>: December, the first time it came about, after the discussions, like I said, it was October 7, 2014.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2695.626s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's when the contract was signed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2701.368s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe it was presented before the council floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2703.649s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A representative from the mayor's office was here on that particular night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2706.79s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe it was the following January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2709.691s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I believe on January 28 of the following year,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2713.635s">[Robert Penta]</a>: the full-blown discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2714.815s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Even maybe Mr. Nash was here the other night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2716.256s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I could be wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2716.976s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Don't hold me to it, but we've had so many of those meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2726.84s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The administration absolutely said it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2728.66s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That money was going to be earmarked on an annual basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2731.391s">[Robert Penta]</a>: from the sale of real estate to the five business districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2737.194s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Oh, yeah, and we got that, as a matter of fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2741.057s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You never got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2741.677s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You never got the request to have it appropriated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2756.51s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you have, Mr. President, approximately $500,000 that needs to be accounted for for the years 2016 and coming into 2017.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2763.131s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2764.732s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And where is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2765.432s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And why is it back into the business districts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2768.152s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's one of the reasons why Mayor McGlynn back then decided to amend it by adding those five additional things into the contract on an annual basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2775.954s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This was going to be out of the sale of real estate, not something over and beyond that for which Park Medford was paying us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2784.466s">[Robert Penta]</a>: as the former budget director, now present mayor, has indicated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2788.709s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2824.169s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Part of that argument, so to speak, back then that was present is it would be on an annual basis that the squares, a representative or representatives from each one of the squares would meet on an annual basis for the purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2836.879s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, let's just say if they were into their second year, which would be up to $100,000,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2841.77s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This could be an ongoing project that maybe needs $50,000, $100,000, $150,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2846.29s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and they could be able to correct whatever it's going to be needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2848.691s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But it's not being done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2850.711s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's been no meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2852.152s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's been no allowance of the money even to come before the council to be spent and have a presentation said, we're giving this money to Haines Square, this money to West Method, this is what the money is going to be used for, and a representative from each one of the people to come here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2865.276s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, this is still taxpayers' money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2867.276s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No matter how you want to cut it, no matter how it's garnered, the fact of the matter is you have a responsibility as councillors<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2873.36s">[Robert Penta]</a>: to say, well, if this is what the deal was, $250,000 a year, you haven't even have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2878.521s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't even have a financial report coming back to you, as you've asked on numerous occasions on an annual or semi-annual basis, revenue coming in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2887.504s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We could just go on and on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2889.444s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But at least on this particular issue, there's nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2892.345s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's nothing to talk about, because there's nothing that's been presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2896.186s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And going back to the CPA, the fact that Larry, could you just do this, please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2900.647s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Did you pass them up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2902.088s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Oh, OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2903.624s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The thing in the CPA, we're not taking it away from anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2906.487s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All we're just saying is you're just going to suspend it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2909.229s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because if you're being told that you're going to get X amount of dollars back for every dollar that you put up, and you're not getting it, why would you want to still keep going back out there and taxing the rate payers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2920.82s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you're taking the million dollars that you have already now for the first year, and you should ask for an accounting, it would be nice to have someone behind the rail ask for an accounting of how much money<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2929.605s">[Robert Penta]</a>: did the city of Medford take in in its first year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2932.007s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're going into your second year of a CPA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2935.229s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What's the intent of spending that money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2937.27s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where is the committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2938.691s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What's their findings?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2939.932s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where's the public meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2941.413s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where's the public hearing for input?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2944.214s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're into the second year of it, three years to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2946.616s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It just doesn't make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2950.138s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've got to read the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2950.999s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The law is very specific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2953.688s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On the CPA especially, after it was passed and introduced, you put anywhere up to a five to a nine member board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2961.113s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's got to be done right after the fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2963.554s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're supposed to have meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2964.535s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're supposed to have this presented to the people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2969.518s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have a board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2970.119s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where's the public meetings on how to spend the money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2976.142s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Can you tell me what it was?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2976.963s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2977.984s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Was it a public meeting before the council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2979.825s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2980.655s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what you've got to read and understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2982.678s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Read the 12 pages that make up the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2985.102s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's very specific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2986.624s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what I'm offering to you is here is not to abolish it, but just to put it on hold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2991.391s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you're not going to get reimbursed from the state, then why take it out of the taxpayers of this community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2996.798s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you can't get it till the end of the fifth year, then so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=2999.961s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was a nice try.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3001.262s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you look at the makeup on how they go, they go by a population standard, and they also go by a tax rate on the appraised property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3008.509s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then it goes into a skew.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3010.731s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a very complex situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3013.213s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if we're generating, Mr. President, over a million dollars a year or thereabouts, and we should be getting that back from the taxpayers of this community, we shouldn't even have to worry about historical things in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3025.159s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We shouldn't have to worry about our parks and open and recreation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3028.16s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We shouldn't have to worry about doing things in the area of public housing in that area or anything else that CPA would allow you to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3036.284s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But we don't even know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3037.425s">[Robert Penta]</a>: None of you know that because you haven't been told what it's going to be used for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3041.027s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You haven't even had any input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3043.369s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is about as transparent as the number six.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3051.634s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Any questions from anybody?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3053.975s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, I'll be back in June and July and hopefully you'll have some kind of an answer to that because if this council feels that they don't want to go forward,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3063.589s">[Robert Penta]</a>: then I will just go to the state legislature and ask some representative to pass it because a lot of these cities and towns, they're starting to feel it now because people are being taxed for something that they're not getting their money back on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3078.339s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3700.137s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The two sections that I'm referring to on the section 18, basically what the proposal says is as follows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3707.608s">[Robert Penta]</a>: At any time after imposition of the surcharge, the legislative body may approve by way of a vote to put on hold any local surcharge tax that cannot receive the matching dollar amount from the state upon population rank in real estate property tax levy calculation, as promulgated by Chapter 44B of the Massachusetts state statute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3729.666s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This allows citizen taxpayers to their fair return of their tax payments until such time<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3735.578s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Until such time, the state has the ability to match the intent and return amount as originally intended, as legislated, and voted upon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3745.185s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is not killing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3746.386s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All it's doing is, how can you tax somebody for something that you're not getting for what you're supposed to be getting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3752.35s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the second part of it is basically saying, very simply, at the end of five years, after the date of approval, and after Sections 3 to 7, which is inclusive, have been accepted by the city or town,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3764.775s">[Robert Penta]</a>: said sections shall come to an end, and the surcharge imposed for the past five years shall end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3770.64s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If the city or town want to continue on with sections three to seven, that's the inclusive part for which the city of Medford accepted, of the Preservation Act, said act shall once again be placed upon the ballot for the taxpayers to vote upon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3785.512s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Just the way it was the first time to be voted upon in November of 2015.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3788.815s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's fair, but to turn around and leave the law the way it is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3794.3s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you want to take it off, you've got to go out there and get the signatures to have the people voted off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3799.622s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, I don't think that's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3801.623s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's a sunset legislation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3803.504s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what it should be after five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3805.565s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if it's really working out that if it's working out that well, then maybe the taxpayers will vote it and maybe the taxpayers won't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3813.349s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if you don't give them that chance in that choice, this will just keep going on at it for item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3817.911s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's a tax that'll never end because it doesn't have the opportunity to end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3822.973s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3842.6s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, just as a point of inquiry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3845.141s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Point of inquiry, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3848.111s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I understand they just received it and placed it on a file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3850.192s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I asked the council to review it so we could have a discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3853.634s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We could review it for the discussion for the July meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3865.24s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3866.461s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I gave it to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3869.223s">[Robert Penta]</a>: One is present and the other one is proposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3872.044s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's the section of the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3874.959s">[Robert Penta]</a>: To the left on the top, it'll say present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3877.159s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the next one down says proposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3889.582s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you want, I will send you a letter as it relates to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3892.823s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3894.043s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3895.543s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Sorry to interrupt you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=3896.284s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Counsel Dello Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=4936.275s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, Bob Penton, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=4939.256s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Two components on this particular issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=4941.037s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm glad it's coming up now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=4943.177s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The first one is I think it's about $112,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=4947.859s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's all that it would cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=4950.02s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is what we were led to believe and what we were told when we changed over from the old metering system to the new one, to have a computerization program upstairs in the engineer's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=4958.79s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that would detect and identify anybody's house in the city of Medford where water would be constantly running or wherever leak might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=4966.552s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And on a daily basis, it would be reviewed, and that homeowner, taxpayer, ratepayer, would be identified either by a phone call or an email or what have you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=4974.754s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That still hasn't taken place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=4977.035s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think the next big thing you really need to address is that 10 years is already up relative to the meters that are in the houses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=4983.097s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's going to have to take a second look on those batteries that are in there and just how accurate they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=4988.02s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I would suggest that you make a resolution to investigate that with the Water and Soil Commissioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=4993.343s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What's their intent going forward as it relates to the accuracy of the batteries that are there, the meters that are there right now that are over 10 years?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=5001.466s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And second of all, why can't some money in that multimillion dollar surplus account be used to put that program<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=5009.138s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't even have to have an employee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=5010.618s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's an automatic program that just spits it out on a daily basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=5014.079s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Someone just looks at it, and it's just, you know, as Jeannie Martin just said, you know, why keep hurting the taxpayer rate payer for no reason at all?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=5021.78s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These are just simple, common sense, everyday business practices that should be employed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=5027.201s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7j4K8jolL8&t=5027.741s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2077.415s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Penter, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of this August body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2083.159s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I come here tonight on two very important issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2088.197s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that directly affect this Medford City Council and the taxpayers of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2093.059s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The first one is to address the issue of the CPA, the Community Preservation Act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2098.18s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As we know, when it was passed in November of 2015, it has a lifespan of five years from the date of its passage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2105.062s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's now going to be just about into its second year with three years to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2109.064s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The unfortunate part about this CPA is that at an election night some two years ago, almost 1,200 to 1,300 ballots<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2117.307s">[Robert Penta]</a>: were never acted upon because a lot of people never turned the ballot over to vote for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2121.409s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So whether it was going to pass or not, nobody even knew.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2124.951s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Apparently, it did pass from those members that did vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2128.172s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The unfortunate part about this particular act, and I'm going to draw the correlation to the connectivity fee, it's another tax being opposed upon the taxpayers of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2138.238s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But unfortunately, they're not getting that for which they voted for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2143.04s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The Enabling Act, which goes back to 2001 and 2002,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2147.789s">[Robert Penta]</a>: addressed itself through the years, right up until this past year, to the fact that whatever and however the population count takes place, and however the tax valuation on assessed pieces of property here in the city of Medford, as in all cities and towns, determines the dollar amount that will come back from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2166.419s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, we all know that for the past years, the Commonwealth has been having a tough time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2171.862s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So let's just go back to fiscal year 2013, the state gave back<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2177.44s">[Robert Penta]</a>: 52 percent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2178.341s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Fiscal year 2014, 31 percent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2181.764s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Fiscal year 2015, 29.7 percent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2186.347s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this present past fiscal year 2016, they were at 18 percent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2191.812s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So for every dollar that every taxpayer here in the city of Medford has given up as it relates to their assessed evaluation at the 1.5 percent, the state will give back approximately 18 percent, which is nowhere near the dollar for dollar of 100 percent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2207.22s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I've spoken to members up at the legislature and I've spoken to other cities and towns where they feel to some degree that the taxpayer is not getting their real bang for the buck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2216.842s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You guys and gals are into this thing on the second year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2219.742s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You still have no program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2221.363s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's still no designation where and how that money can be spent, whether it's for housing, affordable housing, parks and recreation, or historical values.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2232.625s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Those are the three primary things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2235.269s">[Robert Penta]</a>: at a minimum of each one of those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2237.51s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So what I did is I looked at the law and I found it on page, it's section 18.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2243.773s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Larry, he's not here when he comes back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2247.095s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think what I would want to do, and I'll pass one off for each of you, the intent of what I'd like to have is to have you as a city council consider the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2255.139s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Since in fact the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is not paying back dollar for dollar as people<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2260.511s">[Robert Penta]</a>: have been led to believe because of the 158 cities and towns that now make up the CPA throughout the commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2267.658s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't think it's fair that we should keep paying, having our taxpayers pay their 1.5 share for the purposes of hopefully thinking they're going to get a match back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2278.609s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The proposal that I'm asking you as a council to do is to file a piece of legislation to amend<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2285.04s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Section 18, A and B. And in those two sections, they basically will say, if in fact the Commonwealth cannot meet its obligation of dollar for dollar for which the city of Medford at 1.5 is taxing their residents, then the city can suspend, by a vote of the city council, suspend any further collection of those taxes or that 1.5%, or you could also vote to reduce it down to 1%,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2313.327s">[Robert Penta]</a>: until further notice, until the Commonwealth meets its obligation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2316.909s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's the first part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2318.27s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the second part, and I think it's very important that it's understood, that if this city and this council wants to not renew the CPA after its fifth year, at present, the only way you can do it is it becomes automatically taking place unless the city council, by a vote, puts the question on the ballot and the people vote for it all over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2342.007s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My amendment to that portion states basically this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2345.028s">[Robert Penta]</a>: At the end of the fifth year, it automatically dies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2348.389s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If, in fact, the people of this community and whoever the council might be at that time wishes to go forward and renew it again for another five years, then the question goes on the ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2359.073s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You are dealing with right now your second fiscal year on this CPA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2363.635s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't think any one of you behind this rail have even been informed as to where and how that money is going to be spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2368.835s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And there are provisos in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2370.977s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a 12-page document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2372.559s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There are 18 sections that go with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2374.541s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And in those 18 sections, it's very important to understand and to read.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2377.944s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's a great latitude that up to a nine-member board or a commission has with that money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2383.83s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you as a council haven't even been right into the picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2386.632s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No public meetings and hearings have been held to find out where and how that money can be spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2391.154s">[Robert Penta]</a>: While 30% can go to housing, historical, and open space and recreational, the remaining 70% can be likewise used for the same if not similar situations that CPA will approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2404.079s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think you folks really need to take a deep hard look at this particular law because as of July 4th, as I said, once people start getting hit with a connectivity fee every other month and then begin to realize that their 1.5%, which is in excess of a million dollars, is being collected here at City Hall,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2420.382s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the state is not giving back the dollar for dollar, as people thought they did when they voted for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2425.685s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's two unfair taxes being placed upon taxpayers at the present time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2431.449s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The second thing I would like to talk about is the money that, on October 7, 2014, after many weeks of failure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2444.798s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2446.098s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On October 7, 2014, I don't know what's going on here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2453.547s">[Robert Penta]</a>: on October 7th, 2014, after the then Medford City Council was reviewing Park Medford's application before the city of Medford, and Mayor McGlynn, at that point in time, signed the contract on October 7th, 2014.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2472.572s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Five additional addendums were included into that Park Medford contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2479.133s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the one that stands out is the following, it says,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2481.942s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He's recommending $250,000 of the revenue generated on a yearly basis to be dedicated to business district improvements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2490.889s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now that's a result of the mayor making the comment after deliberating and discussing concerns issued by many business people in the community, the mayor is recommending the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2502.359s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And he did that the same day he made that announcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2507.543s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On December 18th, 2015,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2510.643s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The Mayor sent out a notice to the members of the City Council, which basically said, in part, a representative of each business district will recommend to the Mayor some proposed uses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2525.028s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I respectfully request and recommend that the sum of $250,000 be transferred<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2530.673s">[Robert Penta]</a>: from the sale of real estate to be used for improvements to the five business districts with kiosks as I recommended earlier this year, which would have been effective calendar year 2016.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2543.277s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, we go a little bit further.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2544.738s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We go to December 23, 2014.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2549.759s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Once again, in the press release issued by the local press from the mayor's office, it states $250,000 annually would be subject to appropriation<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2558.402s">[Robert Penta]</a>: for district improvements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2560.083s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as a result of that, that came from then the mayor's secretary, Lisa Evangelista, and she was given that by then budget director, Stephanie Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2571.071s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then lastly, we have on January 24th of 2016, once again, after a signing ceremony of a 10-year contract for the program, Mayor McGlynn said $250,000 of the city's annual revenue<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2585.706s">[Robert Penta]</a>: would be used for improvements to business districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2589.207s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is the catch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2590.667s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The prior mayor made a commitment to that, Burke said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2594.248s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When we initially rolled it out, my interpretation was that that would be about and beyond the fixed amount that we collected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2601.97s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, how could that be about and beyond when the mayor specifically said it would come out of your real estate account?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2609.092s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Each district right now is $100,000 behind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2612.571s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and what they should have been getting for the past two years, inclusive of Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2617.395s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe as council members, you have a deep responsibility right now to get answers from this mayor as it relates to not only the $50,000 for each square, where is the money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2629.065s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because that money should be designated in the real estate account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2633.068s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's unfair to the business districts in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2635.977s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is an election year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2636.957s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're going to see a lot of puffing going along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2638.998s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, we're going to do this, and we're going to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2641.199s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, I don't think any of these districts have seen anything going on right now that makes them a lot better than they were when they first started when Park Medford came in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2648.963s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're talking about $500,000 that should be accounted for right now that should come out of that account sale of real estate for which the mayor indicated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2658.578s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You folks have not received one document from this administration telling you that that money would not be forthcoming from that account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2669.769s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I just think it's unfair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2671.511s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it's unfair to the taxpayers, the business people in this community, the Chamber of Commerce, who are all led to believe that that money would be forthcoming and to be there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2680.38s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, I would like to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2683.347s">[Robert Penta]</a>: ask that someone on the council, maybe all the council members, ask the mayor, where is the money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2689.129s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When is it going to be forthcoming to the business districts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2691.99s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And how can we see it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2693.851s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the people of this community will have an understanding that this city keeps its word.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2699.133s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's just not political puffing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2703.894s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'd like to pass out the site and sections of the law, which we just talked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2710.236s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Could you give one to each one, including the clerk?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2712.252s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'd like to have you look at it, and in the July meeting, I'd like to come back and see what your thoughts are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2717.916s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, ratepayers in this community are paying an awful lot, not only for their taxes, in their water bills, their sewer bills, now a connectivity fee, you know, and now we're looking at a CPA tax, that all intentions were good, and I think a lot of people would say if we were getting the 100% back from the Commonwealth, we'd be in good shape.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2738.511s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if it's only progressed for 18% of this year,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2742.231s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's just unfair to keep it in the Medford tax base.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2744.694s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Whether it's $50, $60, $70, $80 a year, that's not the point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2748.218s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's another tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2749.579s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Another tax that cannot be accounted for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2751.762s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this one comes from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2754.385s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So this would probably be easier for you folks to even deal with because it's not even coming from the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2759.37s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'd be more than happy to answer any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2761.662s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I just think, you know, when you start looking at these things, it's election year, and walking the streets and talking to people all day long, this is what I hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2769.066s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why are we paying for these things?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2770.967s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why are we paying for a connectivity fee when we have $850,000 in a water and sewer surplus account?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2776.87s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why are we paying for a CPA tax when we're not even getting 100% reimbursement?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2782.353s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it just doesn't make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2784.014s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then you go into the business districts, they're just completely fed up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2787.335s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They just can't understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2788.82s">[Robert Penta]</a>: what's going on in this building here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2790.501s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's absolutely no communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2792.081s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's no transparency as to how and what money is to be spent around here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2797.403s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'd be more than happy to answer any question if anybody has it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2821.861s">[Robert Penta]</a>: December, the first time it came about after the discussions, like I said, it was October 7th, 2014.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2829.563s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's when the contract was signed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2835.305s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe it was presented before the council floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2837.585s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A representative from the mayor's office was here on that particular night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2840.726s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe it was in the following January and I believe on January 28th of the following year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2847.572s">[Robert Penta]</a>: the full-blown discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2848.752s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Even maybe Mr. Nash was here the other night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2850.193s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I could be wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2850.913s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Don't hold me to it, but we've had so many of those meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2860.757s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The administration absolutely said it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2862.597s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That money was going to be earmarked on an annual basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2865.328s">[Robert Penta]</a>: from the sale of real estate to the five business districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2871.191s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Oh, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2871.351s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And we got that, as a matter of fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2874.994s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You never got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2875.594s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You never got the request to have it appropriated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2890.43s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you have, Mr. President, approximately $500,000 that needs to be accounted for for the years 2016 and coming into 2017.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2897.075s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2898.677s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And where is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2899.357s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And why is it back into the business districts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2902.099s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's one of the reasons why Mayor McGlynn back then decided to amend it by adding those five additional things into the contract on an annual basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2909.906s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This was going to be out of the sale of real estate, not something over and beyond that for which Park Medford was paying us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2918.403s">[Robert Penta]</a>: as the former budget director, now present mayor, has indicated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2922.626s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2958.559s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Part of that argument, so to speak, back then that was present is it would be on an annual basis that the squares, a representative or representatives from each one of the squares would meet on an annual basis for the purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2970.802s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, let's just say if they were into their second year, which would be up to $100,000,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2975.707s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This could be an ongoing project that maybe needs $50,000, $100,000, $150,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2980.23s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and they could be able to correct whatever it's going to be needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2982.611s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But it's not being done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2984.631s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's been no meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2986.072s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's been no allowance of the money even to come before the council to be spent and have a presentation said, we're giving this money to Haines Square, this money to West Method, this is what the money is going to be used for, and a representative from each one of the people to come here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2999.196s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, this is still taxpayers' money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3001.216s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No matter how you want to cut it, no matter how it's garnered, the fact of the matter is you have a responsibility as councillors<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3007.297s">[Robert Penta]</a>: to say, well, if this is what the deal was, $250,000 a year, you haven't even have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3012.44s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't even have a financial report coming back to you, as you've asked on numerous occasions on an annual or semiannual basis, revenue coming in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3021.446s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We could just go on and on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3023.387s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But at least on this particular issue, there's nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3026.349s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's nothing to talk about, because there's nothing that's been presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3030.132s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And going back to the CPA, the fact that Larry, could you just do this, please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3034.595s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Did you pass them out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3036.015s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Oh, OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3037.541s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The thing in the CPA, we're not taking it away from anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3040.424s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All we're just saying is you're just going to suspend it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3043.166s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because if you're being told that you're going to get X amount of dollars back for every dollar that you put up, and you're not getting it, why would you want to still keep going back out there and taxing the rate payers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3054.757s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you're taking the million dollars that you have already now for the first year, and you should ask for an accounting, it would be nice to have someone behind the rail ask for an accounting of how much money<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3063.522s">[Robert Penta]</a>: did the city of Medford take in in its first year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3065.923s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're going into your second year of a CPA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3069.143s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What's the intent of spending that money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3071.184s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where is the committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3072.604s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What's their findings?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3073.844s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where's the public meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3075.345s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where's the public hearing for input?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3078.145s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're into the second year of it, three years to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3080.526s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It just doesn't make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3084.046s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've got to read the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3084.927s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The law is very specific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3087.608s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On the CPA especially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3089.269s">[Robert Penta]</a>: After it was passed and introduced, you put anywhere up to a five to a nine member board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3095.031s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's gotta be done right after the fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3097.472s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're supposed to have meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3098.452s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're supposed to have this presented to the people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3103.434s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have a board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3104.034s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where's the public meetings on how to spend the money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3108.076s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They've already had one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3110.057s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Can you tell me what it was?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3110.897s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know the date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3112.017s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Was it a public meeting before the council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3113.738s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3114.575s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what you've got to read and understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3116.598s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Read the 12 pages that make up the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3119.022s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's very specific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3120.544s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what I'm offering to you is not to abolish it, but just to put it on hold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3125.311s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you're not going to get reimbursed from the state, then why take it out of the taxpayers of this community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3130.718s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you can't get it till the end of the fifth year, then so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3133.441s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was a nice try.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3135.183s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you look at the makeup on how they go, they go by a population standard, and they also go by a tax rate on the appraised property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3142.431s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then it goes into a skew.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3144.653s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a very complex situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3147.136s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if we're generating, Mr. President, over a million dollars a year or thereabouts, and we should be getting that back from the taxpayers of this community, we shouldn't even have to worry about historical things in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3159.082s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We shouldn't have to worry about our parks and open and recreation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3162.083s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We shouldn't have to worry about doing things in the area of public housing in that area or anything else that CPA would allow you to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3170.187s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But we don't even know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3171.348s">[Robert Penta]</a>: None of you know that because you haven't been told what it's going to be used for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3174.969s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You haven't even had any input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3177.29s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is about as transparent as the number six.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3185.553s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Any questions from anybody?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3187.894s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, I'll be back in July and hopefully you'll have some kind of an answer to that because if this council feels that they don't want to go forward,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3197.509s">[Robert Penta]</a>: then I will just go to the state legislature and ask some representative to pass it, because a lot of these cities and towns, they're starting to feel it now, because people are being taxed for something that they're not getting their money back on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3212.259s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3834.022s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The two sections that I'm referring to on the section 18, basically what the proposal says is as follows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3841.491s">[Robert Penta]</a>: At any time after imposition of the surcharge, the legislative body may approve by way of a vote to put on hold any local surcharge tax that cannot receive the matching dollar amount from the state upon population rank in real estate property tax levy calculation, as promulgated by Chapter 44B of the Massachusetts state statute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3863.536s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This allows citizen taxpayers to their fair return of their tax payments until such time<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3869.464s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Until such time, the state has the ability to match the intent and return amount as originally intended, as legislated, and voted upon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3879.071s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is not killing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3880.272s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All it's doing is, how can you tax somebody for something that you're not getting for what you're supposed to be getting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3886.236s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the second part of it is basically saying, very simply, at the end of five years, after the date of approval, and after Sections 3 to 7, which is inclusive, have been accepted by the city or town,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3898.658s">[Robert Penta]</a>: said sections shall come to an end, and the surcharge imposed for the past five years shall end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3904.519s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If the city or town want to continue on with sections three to seven, that's the inclusive part for which the city of Medford accepted of the Preservation Act, said act shall once again be placed upon the ballot for the taxpayers to vote upon, just the way it was the first time to be voted upon in November of 2015.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3922.684s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's fair, but to turn around and leave the law the way it is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3928.183s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you want to take it off, you've got to go out there and get the signatures to have the people voted off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3933.506s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, I don't think that's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3935.527s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's a sunset legislation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3937.387s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what it should be after five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3939.448s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if it's really working out that if it's working out that well, then maybe the taxpayers will vote it and maybe the taxpayers won't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3947.232s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if you don't give them that chance in that choice, this will just keep going on at it for an item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3951.794s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's a tax that'll never end because it doesn't have the opportunity to end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3956.857s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3971.484s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3972.784s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3974.685s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, I heard that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3976.745s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, it's just as a point of inquiry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3979.006s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Point of inquiry, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3982.007s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I understand they just received it and placed it on a file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3984.007s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I asked the council to review it so we could have a discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3987.532s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We could review it for discussion for the July meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=4000.339s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I gave it to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=4003.101s">[Robert Penta]</a>: One is present, and the other one is proposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=4005.922s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's the section of the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=4008.844s">[Robert Penta]</a>: To the left on the top, it'll say present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=4011.045s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the next one down says proposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=4023.467s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you want, I will send you a letter as it relates to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=4026.71s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=4027.95s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=4029.431s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Sorry to interrupt you, Councilor Dello Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=5070.108s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, Bob Henton, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=5073.09s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Two components on this particular issue, and I'm glad it's coming up now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=5077.014s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The first one is, I think it's about $112,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=5081.377s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's all that it would cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=5083.859s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is what we were led to believe and what we were told when we changed over from the old metering system to the new one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=5089.048s">[Robert Penta]</a>: to have a computerization program upstairs in the engineer's office that would detect and identify anybody's house in the city of Medford where water would be constantly running or wherever a leak might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=5100.395s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And on a daily basis, it would be reviewed, and that homeowner, taxpayer, ratepayer, would be identified either by a phone call or an email or what have you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=5108.62s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That still hasn't taken place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=5110.882s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think the next big thing you really need to address<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=5113.233s">[Robert Penta]</a>: is that 10 years is already up relative to the meters that are in the houses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=5116.915s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's going to have to take a second look on those batteries that are in there and just how accurate they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=5121.837s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I would suggest that you probably make a resolution to investigate that with the Water and Soil Commissioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=5127.179s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What's their intent going forward as it relates to the accuracy of the batteries that are there, the meters that are there right now that are over 10 years?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=5135.323s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And second of all, why can't some money in that multimillion dollar surplus account be used to put that program<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=5142.974s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't even have to have an employee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=5144.374s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's an automatic program that just spits it out on a daily basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=5147.915s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Someone just looks at it, and it's just, you know, as Jeannie Martin just said, you know, why keep hurting the taxpayer rate payer for no reason at all?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=5155.617s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These are just simple, common sense, everyday business practices that should be employed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=5161.018s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8841.125s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert M. Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of this August body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8846.808s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The reason why I'm up here is twofold, as the resolution indicates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8851.348s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I was a little befuddled when I got a copy of my water bill, and then I got a copy of the letter signed by the Board of Water and Soil Commissioners as it relates to what they call a baseline fee, which is, in essence, is a new tax on the rate payers here within this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8866.493s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In their letter where they make an assessment of $24,000 is $24,483 is necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8869.314s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know if this is a misprint on the spelling here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8880.103s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Pardon me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8881.705s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's 24 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8882.646s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, that's the amount, I believe, of the total amount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8885.468s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe, if I understood it correctly from the chairman of the board, he alleged that it was approximately a $300,000 deficit on the sewer account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8893.516s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, this August, Marty, some weeks ago, voted to incorporate your enterprise fund, which includes the water and sewer account, as one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8902.325s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And by having the water and sewer count as one, that allows you, by right and by law, to make adjustments as it relates to profits and losses on either side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8912.335s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And at the present time, the new water bills that are going to be going out are going to be having an alleged 3% reduction in your water rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8921.764s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you're going to be charged what they call now a new connectivity fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8926.325s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this connectivity fee is addressing the fact that if you have whatever your line is that you have in your house, as it relates to your water and sewer hookup, from your house to the street, for which every taxpayer who owns the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8961.89s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The fact of the matter is that the Water and Sewer Commission signed it, and the mayor of this community has allowed it, and likewise, this Medford City Council has done nothing to rebut it, for which you have a unique opportunity right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8973.763s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The fact also presents itself with the issue that with this new combined water and sewer allowance,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=8981.519s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why would you be reducing your water rate by 3% and now coming in and want to put a brand new tax on each and every other month, bimonthly, six times a year, ad infinitum, on Medford taxpayers, knowing that you have a surplus in excess of $8 million and you have a deficit in the sewer account<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9003.965s">[Robert Penta]</a>: for this 2018 year of $300,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9006.266s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That does not make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9010.307s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the reason why it makes no sense is you will continuously keep going with a profit that you have, and your water and sewer count, and you have nothing presented before you as of the meeting that we had a month ago and as of tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9021.69s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Any major road construction, any major sidewalk construction, any street construction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9040.883s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The fact of the matter is, Mr. President, the connectivity tax that's going to be charged to the ratepayers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9072.846s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The Water and Sewer Commission comes under the auspices of the Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9075.167s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They are appointed by the Mayor, and their recommendations go to the Mayor, and their recommendations, I'm quite sure, could not be holding to the taxpayers of this community at an outrageous rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9084.509s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So a new tax and fee is being implemented on the taxpayers of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9159.838s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm glad you apologized on behalf of the council, because most recently, everybody got in their water and sewer bills<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9174.068s">[Robert Penta]</a>: a letter that indicated that they were going to be getting a new processing baseline rate, which I will call a tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9182.058s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a new tax implemented on the citizens of this community on their water and sewer bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9187.445s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's called a connectivity fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9190.017s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you're going to be paying for that each and every other month, six times a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9195.439s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Every taxpayer that owns their home owns from their house to the middle of the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9200.381s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's their pipe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9201.822s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what they're responsible for, and that's what they pay for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9205.043s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They make that connection already into the city's water and sewer line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9208.925s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The city is already charging you for water and sewer coming into your house through your pipe, through the connection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9215.548s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, the argument that's being used by the Water and Sewer Commission is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9219.329s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We need to put this money aside, which is approximately $1 million a year, according to the type and size of your pipe coming into your house, connected to the street, to offset any future costs that might put the city in a negative position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9236.053s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My argument before this honorable body, I hope most of you can accept that word,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9242.984s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Honorable, is the fact that the water and sewer account that we have right now is an $8.5 million surplus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9252.155s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've merged, within the past two months, the water and sewer accounts of the Enterprise as to be one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9258.823s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you are alleging, as the Water and Sewer Commission is alleging, there was a $300,000 deficit in the sewer account, but at the same time you're proposing a 3% reduction in the water rate for next year, the irony to that does not make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9275.631s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9276.352s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because you have an $8 million surplus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9278.633s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have them both now merged together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9280.674s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the law allows you to take a surplus from one to offset the negative of another or vice versa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9287.077s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The other thing that this Water and Soil Commission has failed to do, it's under a 360 CMR 1100.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9294.762s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a continuation of contract water supplies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9298.465s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this came out in 1994.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9299.285s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it states the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9301.947s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You incorporate a uniform rate or an alternative structure which provides incentives for water conservation and or is designed to ensure the affordability of water service to low and or fixed income people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9317.117s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't have that at the present time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9319.76s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's never been brought up before the Water and Soil Commission to give that particular rate out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9324.704s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9326.485s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if you're even going to get into the idea of the thought process of wanting to get into this, how do you justify the rates that are being proposed by the city?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9335.914s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The rates being proposed by the city range anywhere from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9341.055s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A residential house up to 3 quarters of an inch would be $51.66 a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9347.142s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, you may say it's only $51.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9349.125s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you know something?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9351.387s">[Robert Penta]</a>: $51 to some people is a lot of money, especially if you want a fixed income.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9355.272s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you have a one-inch line coming into your house, it's $141 a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9360.658s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Take that and add it on to the CPA tax, for which you're not even going to get reimbursed by the state on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9366.241s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That is another $50, $60 a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9368.281s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And now you're almost up to over $150, $200 a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9372.023s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Your taxes each and every year continuously keep going up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9375.064s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's absolutely unfair for the city to even entertain or engage itself in a connectivity fee tax every other month when you're sitting on that kind of a profit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9385.749s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, if you want to be realistic and look at this thing and say, OK, maybe we should do like some other cities and towns, the community of Melrose, your sister next door, they have a one-time fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9397.352s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's at the discretion of the director of public works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9400.553s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a one-time fee of $50.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9403.073s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you're building a new house and it's a first-time connection, so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9406.734s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you're rebuilding your house and you have to make a reconnection, that reconnection is either $50 and or at the discretion<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9414.753s">[Robert Penta]</a>: of the Director of Public Works, because if you're the same owner, it could be abated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9418.623s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It just doesn't make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9423.246s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It doesn't make any sense because you, as the Medford City Council, are supposed to be looking out for the best financial interests of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9432.07s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the only way you can seem to do it right now, at least through the majority of you, if you so choose, is you just hold this budget in abeyance until the mayor comes forward and indicates how can you keep going out and making these charges against Medford taxpayers and ratepayers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9450.757s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let's flip over to the second part, to the hotel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9454.34s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have a hotel proposal that you haven't even sat down, hasn't even been discussed, and there the mayor of this community in the State of the City address in February says this is going to be up and running by the fall of 2019.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9469.977s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You haven't had a discussion either with the contractor who's only been around since 2013.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9476.16s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't even know what the taxes is going to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9479.221s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the best part about this hotel, you need city and state land to be taken to accommodate the parking that's necessary for this proposed hotel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9487.624s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Here's your time to discuss it during the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9490.886s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you don't discuss it, why give the vote out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9494.487s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It doesn't make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9496.741s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's unfortunate under this form of government that this mayor who said she was going to be transparent and would have someone here each and every week to listen and to discuss these issues, there's nobody here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9507.723s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're lucky if that person's been here twice in the two years that it's been here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9512.144s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what doesn't make sense is how can you go back and keep telling Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer that this is only a small little dollar amount, especially when you're dealing with a surplus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9523.086s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've got $9 million in your free cash or thereabouts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9526.892s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But nobody around here has discussed your $29 million in an unfunded liability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9533.258s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How are you going to address that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9534.9s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And is this new connectivity charge going to be able to be used to offset salaries and wages of employees in that department, pension system funds?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9544.97s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These are the questions you need to ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9547.232s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the low and moderate income, fixed income people don't even have a break on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9552.242s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So while you think you're making the taxpayer feel good because you're lowering his water rate by 3%, you're charging him in excess of the 3% by having a bimonthly, six times a year, new tax being placed upon him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9569.271s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the line that should really get you in every single ratepayer is this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9573.513s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It says the base rate is not a tax, nor is it an additional charge in which residents pay for water and sewer services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9581.059s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, you tell me what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9583.101s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You tell me, Mr. President, what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9585.223s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If it's not a tax, okay, if it's not a fee, and if it's not for water and sewer services, well, why am I paying a connectivity fee to let that water go through that pipe that comes into the pipe that I own, that comes into my house, that you charge me water and sewer taxes on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9601.263s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I respectfully ask this Medford City Council to ask this mayor, you hold up this question and remove this connectivity fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9609.29s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's an unfair tax, it's unnecessary, and it does not do good for the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9616.156s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm more than happy to answer any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9618.238s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9645.443s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How you would rebut it is you would tell the mayor that we're not voting for your budget until you tell the Water and Sewer commissioners to roll back that fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9654.29s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You justify $8.5 million sitting there and justify telling the taxpayers you're going to generate another million dollars plus a year with this connectivity fee, and you don't even have a program set aside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9667.262s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Look at every street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9668.383s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Look at all the streets that are waiting to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9670.585s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Look at the potholes that can't get done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9672.527s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Look at Evans Street that's been promised for almost two years they were going to get done when the water main broke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9678.032s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We could just go on and on and on with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9680.434s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can't keep charging the taxpayers of this community for something, especially when you're sitting on millions of dollars in a surplus in this particular account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9714.735s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're reducing the water rate, Madam Chairperson, we're reducing the water rate by 3%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9720.52s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if you have a $24 million cost, whatever it is, I think that's what you said, Mr. President, for the cost of coming in this year, and inclusive of that cost is water and sewer charges, because it's coming in, and we all know that your sewer charge is at 121% of your water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9734.975s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if the city already knows that they're going to be operating at a $300,000 loss, why wouldn't you just take the money from your $8.5 million profit rather than go out and tell the people we're going to charge you for a connectivity fee and have the audacity to put in a letter that's got nothing to do with water and sewer services?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9753.321s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What do you think, people are stupid?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9755.785s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm not stupid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9757.245s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, I love this city, and I'll do anything to make it right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9760.627s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But when I see stuff like this, this really gets to me, all right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9764.248s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it should get to every one of you members of the City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9767.209s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because it's not right, it's not fair, and you can't even take care of people on fixed incomes, you know, allowing you to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9774.631s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You haven't even discussed that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9775.891s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where's the Water and Soil Commissioner on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9781.035s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Didn't mean TL, Mr. President, but you know something?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9783.516s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When you sit here all night and you watch what's going on here and you're being played to wait till the end of the night, I get upset.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9790.337s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9791.298s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But every dog has its day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9792.478s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Remember that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9793.658s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's an election coming up and I hope people remember that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGliI9h-Ql4&t=9796.579s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5235.912s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert M. Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of this August party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5241.575s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The reason why I'm up here is twofold, as the resolution indicates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5246.123s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I was a little befuddled when I got a copy of my water bill, and then I got a copy of the letter signed by the Board of Water and Soil Commissioners as it relates to what they call a baseline fee, which is, in essence, is a new tax on the rate payers here within this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5261.268s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In their letter, where they make an assessment of $24,000, is $24,483 is necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5264.129s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know if this is a misprint on the spelling here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5274.929s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Pardon me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5276.51s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's $24 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5277.47s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, that's the amount, I believe, of the total amount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5280.291s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe, if I understood it correctly from the chairman of the board, he alleged that it was approximately a $300,000 deficit on the sewer account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5288.314s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, this August, Marty, some weeks ago, voted to incorporate your enterprise fund, which includes the water and sewer account, as one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5297.157s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And by having the water and sewer count as one, that allows you, by right and by law, to make adjustments as it relates to profits and losses on either side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5307.14s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And at the present time, the new water bills that are going to be going up are going to be having an alleged 3% reduction in your water rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5316.563s">[Robert Penta]</a>: but you're going to be charged what they call now a new connectivity fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5321.125s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this connectivity fee is addressing the fact that if you have whatever your line is that you have in your house, as it relates to your water and sewer hookup, from your house to the street, for which every taxpayer who owns the property owns the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5357.829s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The fact of the matter is that the Water and Sewer Commission signed it and the mayor of this community has allowed it and likewise this Metfit City Council has done nothing to rebut it for which you have a unique opportunity right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5369.713s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The fact also presents itself with the issue that with this new combined water and sewer allowance<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5377.458s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why would you be reducing your water rate by 3% and now coming in and want to put a brand new tax on each and every other month, bimonthly, six times a year, ad infinitum, on Medford taxpayers, knowing that you have a surplus in excess of $8 million and you have a deficit in the sewer account<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5399.925s">[Robert Penta]</a>: for this 2018 year of $300,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5402.225s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That does not make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5406.266s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the reason why it makes no sense is you will continuously keep going with a profit that you have, and your water and sewer count, and you have nothing presented before you as at the meeting that we had a month ago and as of tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5417.649s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Any major road construction, any major sidewalk construction, any street construction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5436.818s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The fact of the matter is, Mr. President, the connectivity tax that's going to be charged to the ratepayers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5468.841s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The Water and Sewer Commission comes under the auspices of the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5471.163s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They are appointed by the mayor, and their recommendations go to the mayor, and their recommendations, I'm quite sure, could not be holding to the taxpayers of this community at an outrageous rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5480.51s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So a new tax and fee is being implemented on the taxpayers of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5555.841s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm glad you apologized on behalf of the council, because most recently, everybody got in their water and sewer bills<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5570.062s">[Robert Penta]</a>: a letter that indicated that they were going to be getting a new processing baseline rate, which I will call a tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5578.03s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a new tax implemented on the citizens of this community on their water and sewer bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5583.455s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's called a connectivity fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5586.02s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you're going to be paying for that each and every other month, six times a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5591.441s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Every taxpayer that owns their home owns from their house to the middle of the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5596.382s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's their pipe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5597.823s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what they're responsible for, and that's what they pay for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5601.044s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They make that connection already into the city's water and sewer line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5604.905s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The city is already charging you for water and sewer coming into your house through your pipe, through the connection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5611.546s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, the argument that's being used by the Water and Sewer Commission is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5615.327s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We need to put this money aside, which is approximately $1 million a year, according to the type and size of your pipe coming into your house, connected to the street, to offset any future costs that might put the city in a negative position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5632.054s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My argument before this honorable body, I hope most of you can accept that word,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5638.97s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Honorable, is the fact that the water and sewer account that we have right now is an $8.5 million surplus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5648.156s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've merged, within the past two months, the water and sewer accounts of the Enterprise as to be one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5654.821s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you are alleging, as the Water and Sewer Commission is alleging, there was a $300,000 deficit in the sewer account, but at the same time you're proposing a 3% reduction in the water rate for next year, the irony to that does not make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5671.566s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5672.287s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because you have an $8 million surplus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5674.567s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have them both now merged together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5676.608s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the law allows you to take a surplus from one to offset the negative of another or vice versa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5683.01s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The other thing that this Water and Soil Commission has failed to do, it's under a 360 CMR 1100.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5690.712s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a continuation of contract water supplies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5694.413s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this came out in 1994.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5695.233s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it states the following, you incorporate a uniform rate or an alternative structure which provides incentives for water conservation and or is designed to ensure the affordability of water service to low and or fixed income people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5713.057s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't have that at the present time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5715.7s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's never been brought up before the Water and Soil Commission to give that particular rate out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5720.644s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5722.426s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if you're even going to get into the idea of the thought process of wanting to get into this, how do you justify the rates that are being proposed by the city?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5731.855s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The rates being proposed by the city range anywhere from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5736.98s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A residential house up to three quarters of an inch would be $51.66 a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5743.082s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now you may say it's only $51, but you know something?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5745.822s">[Robert Penta]</a>: $51 to some people is a lot of money, especially if you're on a fixed income.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5751.184s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you have a one inch line coming into your house, it's $141 a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5756.585s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Take that and add it on to the CPA tax, for which you're not even going to get reimbursed by the state on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5762.19s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That is another $50, $60 a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5764.212s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And now you're almost up to over $150, $200 a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5767.955s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Your taxes each and every year continuously keep going up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5770.997s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's absolutely unfair for the city to even entertain or engage itself in a connectivity fee tax every other month when you're sitting on that kind of a profit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5781.666s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, if you want to be realistic and look at this thing and say, okay, maybe we should do like some other cities and towns, the community of Melrose, your sister next door, they have a one-time fee and it's at the discretion of the director of public works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5796.47s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a one-time fee of $50 and if you're building a new house and it's a first-time connection, so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5802.652s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you're rebuilding your house and you have to make a reconnection, that reconnection is either $50 and or at the discretion<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5810.671s">[Robert Penta]</a>: of the Director of Public Works, because if you're the same order, it could be abated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5814.558s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It just doesn't make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5819.165s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It doesn't make any sense because you, as the Medford City Council, are supposed to be looking out for the best financial interests of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5828.009s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the only way you can seem to do it right now, at least through the majority of you, if you so choose, is you just hold this budget in abeyance until the mayor comes forward and indicates how can you keep going out and making these charges against Medford taxpayers and ratepayers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5846.697s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let's flip over to the second part, to the hotel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5850.261s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have a hotel proposal that you haven't even sat down, hasn't even been discussed, and there the mayor of this community in the State of the City address in February says this is going to be up and running by the fall of 2019.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5865.902s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You haven't had a discussion either with the contractor who's only been around since 2013.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5872.086s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't even know what the taxes is going to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5875.149s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the best part about this hotel, you need city and state land to be taken to accommodate the parking that's necessary for this proposed hotel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5883.575s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Here's your time to discuss it during the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5886.817s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you don't discuss it, why give the vote out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5890.42s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It doesn't make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5892.672s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's unfortunate under this form of government that this mayor who said she was going to be transparent and would have someone here each and every week to listen and to discuss these issues, there's nobody here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5903.656s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're lucky if that person's been here twice in the two years that it's been here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5908.078s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what doesn't make sense is how can you go back and keep telling Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer that this is only a small little dollar amount, especially when you're dealing with a surplus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5919.023s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've got $9 million in your free cash or thereabouts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5922.805s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But nobody around here has discussed your $29 million in an unfunded liability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5929.169s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How are you going to address that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5930.83s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And is this new connectivity charge going to be able to be used to offset salaries and wages of employees in that department, pension system funds?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5940.876s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These are the questions you need to ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5943.157s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the low and moderate income, fixed income people don't even have a break on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5948.163s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So while you think you're making the taxpayer feel good because you're lowering his water rate by 3%, you're charging him in excess of the 3% by having a bimonthly, six times a year, new tax being placed upon him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5965.193s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the line that should really get you in every single ratepayer is this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5969.435s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It says, the base rate is not a tax, nor is it an additional charge in which residents pay for water and sewer services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5976.979s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, you tell me what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5979.02s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You tell me, Mr. President, what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5981.141s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If it's not a tax, okay, if it's not a fee, and if it's not for water and sewer services, well, why am I paying a connectivity fee to let that water go through that pipe that comes into the pipe that I own, that comes into my house, that you charge me water and sewer taxes on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=5997.176s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I respectfully ask this Medford City Council to ask this mayor, you hold up this budget and remove this connectivity fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6005.198s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's an unfair tax, it's unnecessary, and it does not do good for the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6012.059s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm more than happy to answer any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6014.139s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6041.369s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How you would rebut it is you would tell the mayor that we're not voting for your budget until you tell the Water and Sewer commissioners to roll back that fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6050.214s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You justify $8.5 million sitting there and justify telling the taxpayers you're going to generate another million dollars plus a year with this connectivity fee, and you don't even have a program set aside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6063.183s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Look at every street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6064.304s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Look at all the streets that are waiting to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6066.505s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Look at the potholes that can't get done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6068.445s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Look at Evans Street that's been promised for almost two years they were going to get done when the water main broke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6073.968s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We could just go on and on and on with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6076.369s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can't keep charging the taxpayers of this community for something, especially when you're sitting on millions of dollars in a surplus in this particular account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6110.682s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're reducing the water rate, Madam Chairperson, we're reducing the water rate by 3%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6116.467s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if you have a $24 million cost, whatever it is, I think that's what you said, Mr. President, for the cost of coming in this year, and inclusive of that cost is water and sewer charges, because it's coming in, and we all know that your sewer charge is at 121% of your water,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6130.906s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if the city already knows that they're going to be operating at a $300,000 loss, why wouldn't you just take the money from your $8.5 million profit rather than go out and tell the people we're going to charge you for a connectivity fee and have the audacity to put in a letter that's got nothing to do with water and sewer services?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6149.28s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What do you think, people are stupid?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6151.72s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm not stupid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6153.201s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, I love this city, and I'll do anything to make it right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6156.564s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But when I see stuff like this, this really gets to me, all right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6159.906s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it should get to every one of you members of the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6163.149s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because it's not right, it's not fair, and you can't even take care of people on fixed incomes, you know, allowing you to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6170.575s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You haven't even discussed that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6171.835s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where's the Water and Soil Commissioner on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6176.973s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Didn't mean T.L., Mr. President, but you know something?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6179.454s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When you sit here all night and you watch what's going on here and you're being played to wait till the end of the night, I get upset, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6187.239s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But every dog has its day, remember that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6189.6s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's an election coming up, and I hope people remember that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=6192.522s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1606.259s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1607.46s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Pantazero, Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of the Saugus party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1612.641s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My records that I have dating back when I was in the council go back to 2010.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1617.385s">[Robert Penta]</a>: when this proposal was made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1618.926s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the very first proposal was made by David Hatzell, who was a city engineer some multiple years ago, 20 years ago, when he got involved in an I&I program that saved the city approximately a million gallons of water per day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1631.794s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, subsequent to that period of time, up until now, you've had loans, grant loans, from the MWRA that either were interest-free or minimum<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1641.952s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and some of them have ranged anywhere from $5 million to $3.5 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1647.274s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The sad part about all of this, as Councilor Marksley alluded to, is the fact that you have unaccounted for water in this city, which ranges anywhere from 17, 18, 19, 20%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1656.657s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Nobody really has the final handle on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1659.278s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But there are a lot of services in this community that are using our water for which taxpayers, city taxpayers are paying for, and that's unfair too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1670.53s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now you folks just passed, I believe it was last week, the combining of your water and sewer accounts together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1678.453s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I would suggest as an addendum to the resolution tonight, that a request be made to your city solicitor for the purposes of, since these have now been merged together, can those monies be used for any other enterprises or any other general expenditures within your enterprise fund?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1697.747s">[Robert Penta]</a>: checking this out with other states, and every state does it different as it relates to enterprise funds, I think it's important to note, because if you have merged these two accounts together financially, and where one has a deficit in one year and one might have an excess in another year, it would be very<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1714.206s">[Robert Penta]</a>: convenient to offset one from the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1716.668s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Again, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1717.969s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Every state does it different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1719.59s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I think it would behoove you to check this out with your city solicitor as to how the methods merging of its water and sewer account is used as it relates to any other fund, general fund, enterprise funds, general revenue account funds that the city has, because in some states, they're allowed to take the excess profit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1738.565s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Also, you folks, just as a reminder, what took place last week,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1743.008s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You were told at a meeting by Mr. Fox and by the chairman of the Water and Sewer Commission that the water rates are going to be reduced by approximately 3% this year, by approximately 3%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1753.912s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But at the same time, they're going to be introducing what they call a connectivity fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1757.973s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the connectivity fee is going to be going toward pipe size coming into your house, anywhere from a half inch up to 10 inches, depending whether you're residential or whether you're a commercial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1769.232s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think it's important to note that I think the chairman of the board said, well, we're not going to call it connectivity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1775.535s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're going to call it baseline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1777.316s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But baseline already has its position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1780.137s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It has its position within the Mass General Laws under chapter 60.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1784.539s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where is it here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1786.04s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's under chapter 65, chapter 165, section 2B, where it talks about baseline having an effect<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1796.799s">[Robert Penta]</a>: on a city or town which does not reflect upon connectivity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1800.441s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It goes against large consumer use or the rate of use in the community, whether it goes up or down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1807.103s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think that's something you as a council need to get, that's got to be corrected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1811.045s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And hopefully, I wish somebody from the Water and Sewer Department were here, chairman or otherwise, to explain this connectivity fee because I think as we all know, people are looking at it as another fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1821.709s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How can you be charging another fee on a bimonthly basis when in fact,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1825.855s">[Robert Penta]</a>: your water rates are going down by 3%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1828.317s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But since, in fact, I believe it was alleged that there is a deficit on the sewer department side, and now with the merging of the water and sewer accounts together, I think the second question needs to be asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1839.867s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Can the excess from one, which would be the revenue, the profit, or the excess money on that, can you use it to offset the deficit from one to the other?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1848.995s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because if you look at the merging of the two,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1851.228s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It incorporates all your vehicles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1854.569s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It incorporates your employees, equipment, salaries, and everything else that goes along with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1859.951s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I think there is a benefit to what Councilor Marks is alluding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1864.613s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But more importantly, I don't think that the Medford taxpayer, knowing that there's over $7.5 million in excess account in this particular area, should be taken for the ride of saying, hey,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1876.48s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, if you're right, Councilor Markson, it's up to 21%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1879.603s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But whatever it is, there should be a full accounting of the water and the metering of the water and how it's being distributed here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1887.891s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, we all run businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1890.013s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Probably some people use more water than others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1894.137s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if you're going to go that route and you're going to start charging people for the size of their water meter coming in, water pipe coming in,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1901.422s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, that's going to have a profound effect on each and every taxpayer here in the city of Medford, because that's going to be on a bimonthly charge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1908.084s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as the enterprise fund will tell you, and all you have to do is look up other states and other cities and towns and how the merging of enterprise funds, what you can and cannot do with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1919.327s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's a whole host of activities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1921.267s">[Robert Penta]</a>: For example, in Winchester, they have an enterprise fund, but they also have an enterprise activity account fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1927.629s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And again, trying to get a handle on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1929.29s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It also deals with recreation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1930.993s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and a whole host of other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1932.654s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Granted, Winchester's a town and not a city, but it's the intent and it's the purpose of the legislation and the merger that is written.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1939.796s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I would suggest that one of you make this request of the city solicitor, just what, in fact, does this enterprise fund, now that it's merged together, water and sewer, allow the city of Medford to do with those monies?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1952.701s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Can they transfer them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1954.021s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Can they merge them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1955.222s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Can they be used to offset?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1957.119s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It doesn't seem logical or with any sense of common sense that you could be having a profit in the water side and you have a deficit on the sewer side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1966.948s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But to this day, you haven't been able to offset it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1969.13s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But what you're going to be doing is charging a connectivity fee on your pipeline coming in, which supposedly will offset the sewer charge according to what was told you last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1979.7s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But at the same time, you're going to be reducing your water rate by 3%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1983.702s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a lot for people to understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1985.684s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It doesn't make any sense at all, especially when you're sitting on seven and a half million dollars, whether you want to call it surplus, reserve, or whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1993.369s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is a huge issue that's before you right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=1995.591s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Other than your tax bill, it's the next biggest thing that the citizen of this community has to deal with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=2001.075s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And just for an example, relative to a connectivity fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=2005.375s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And your town of Stoneham, which is right across the border, they just have a one-time connectivity charge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=2012.097s">[Robert Penta]</a>: New house going up, new resident, new line going in, $50 for a residential unit, up to one to five units.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=2020.059s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And anything over that in a commercial, it's $1,000 hookup.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=2023.459s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's what it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=2025.24s">[Robert Penta]</a>: One-inch service is $500.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=2027.6s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A one- to two-inch service is $750.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=2029.841s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And a two-inch service or above is $1,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=2032.121s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Numbers are a lot lower than what's being proposed here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=2034.507s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a one-time fee, and that fee is at the discretion of the Director of Public Works and the City of Stoneham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=2040.691s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Every city and town does it different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=2042.092s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=2043.293s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But it's hard to explain to the Mr. and Mrs. Medford resident that when you just gave them a new tax increase in their bill, when you're hitting them with a CPA tax, Community Preservation Act tax, for which the Commonwealth will not even meet its obligation to match the dollar for dollar that each rate payer is paying,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=2062.493s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because that's what the people voted on under that assumption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=2065.535s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And now you may be hitting them with a connectivity fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=2067.596s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's just not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=2069.096s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So as Councilor Marks has alluded to, and hopefully the council will go along with it, I really think you need a complete assessment of all the water, all the sewer usage here in the city of Metro to get a better handle as it relates to what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=2082.063s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's just a shame that your Water and Sewer Commissioners do not appear before this board to explain this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=2087.706s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is really an involved process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=2090.897s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you're once again hitting the rate payers with another fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=2094.198s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I would assume that that would be very hard to explain, very hard to explain when you're sitting on $7.5 million profit at the present time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=2102.099s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1020.423s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1388.489s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On the motion by Councilor Marks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1390.75s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1391.93s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Pantazero, Summit Road, Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1395.131s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Former member of the Saugus party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1397.112s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My records that I have dating back when I was in the council go back to 2010.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1401.874s">[Robert Penta]</a>: when this proposal was made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1403.415s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the very first proposal was made by David Hadsall, who was a city engineer some multiple years ago, 20 years ago, when he got involved in an I&I program that saved the city approximately a million gallons of water per day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1416.266s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, subsequent to that period of time, up until now, you've had loans, grant loans, from the MWRA that either were interest-free or minimum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1426.421s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and some of them have ranged anywhere from $5 million to $3.5 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1431.765s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The sad part about all of this, as Councilor Marx has alluded to, is the fact that you have unaccounted for water in this city, which ranges anywhere from 17, 18, 19, 20%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1440.211s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Nobody really has the final handle on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1443.754s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But there are a lot of services in this community that are using our water for which taxpayers, city taxpayers are paying for, and that's unfair too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1455.0s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now you folks just passed, I believe it was last week, the combining of your water and sewer accounts together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1461.623s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I would suggest as an addendum to the resolution tonight that a request be made to your city solicitor for the purposes of, since these have now been merged together, can those monies be used for any other enterprises or any other general expenditures within your enterprise fund?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1482.236s">[Robert Penta]</a>: checking this out with other states, and every state does it different as it relates to enterprise funds, I think it's important to note, because if you have merged these two accounts together financially, and where one has a deficit in one year and one might have an excess in another year, it would be very<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1498.695s">[Robert Penta]</a>: convenient to offset one from the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1501.157s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Again, I don't know, every state does it different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1504.079s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I think it would behoove you to check this out with your city solicitor as to how the methods merging of its water and sewer account is used as it relates to any other fund, general fund, enterprise funds, general revenue account funds that the city has, because in some states they're allowed to take the excess profit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1523.055s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Also, you folks, just as a reminder, what took place last week,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1527.498s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You were told at a meeting by Mr. Fox and by the chairman of the Water and Sewer Commission that the water rates are going to be reduced by approximately 3% this year, by approximately 3%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1538.407s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But at the same time, they're going to be introducing what they call a connectivity fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1542.471s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the connectivity fee is going to be going toward pipe size coming into your house, anywhere from a half inch up to 10 inches, depending whether you're residential or whether you're a commercial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1553.722s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think it's important to note that I think the chairman of the board said, well, we're not going to call it connectivity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1559.964s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're going to call it baseline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1561.805s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But baseline already has its position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1564.626s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It has its position within the Mass General Laws under chapter 60.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1569.027s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where is it here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1570.528s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's under chapter 65, chapter 165, section 2B, where it talks about baseline having an effect<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1581.288s">[Robert Penta]</a>: on a city or town which does not reflect upon connectivity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1584.93s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It goes against large consumer use or the rate of use in the community, whether it goes up or down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1591.592s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think that's something you as a council need to get, that's got to be corrected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1595.534s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And hopefully, I wish somebody from the Water and Sewer Department were here, chairman or otherwise, to explain this connectivity fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1602.016s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because I think as we all know, people are looking at it as another fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1606.198s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How can you be charging another fee on a bimonthly basis when in fact,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1610.344s">[Robert Penta]</a>: your water rates are going down by 3%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1612.786s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But since, in fact, I believe it was alleged that there is a deficit on the sewer department side, and now with the merging of the water and sewer accounts together, I think the second question needs to be asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1624.356s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Can the excess from one, which would be the revenue, the profit, or the excess money on that, can you use it to offset the deficit from one to the other?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1633.484s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because if you look at the merging of the two,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1635.7s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It incorporates all your vehicles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1639.041s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It incorporates your employees, equipment, salaries, and everything else that goes along with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1644.444s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I think there is a benefit to what Councilor Marks is alluding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1649.106s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But more importantly, I don't think that the Medford taxpayer, knowing that there's over $7.5 million in excess account in this particular area, should be taken for the ride of saying, hey, if you're right, Councilor Marks, and it's up to 21%, but whatever it is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1665.276s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There should be a full accounting of the water and the metering of the water, and how it's being distributed here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1672.962s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We all run businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1674.504s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Probably some people use more water than others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1678.627s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if you're going to go that route, and you're going to start charging people for the size of their water meter coming in, water pipe coming in,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1685.911s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, that's going to have a profound effect on each and every taxpayer here in the city of Medford, because that's going to be on a bimonthly charge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1692.572s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as the enterprise fund will tell you, and all you have to do is look up other states and other cities and towns and how the merging of enterprise funds, what you can and cannot do with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1827.807s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But it's hard to explain to the Mr. and Mrs. Medford resident that when you just gave them<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1833.931s">[Robert Penta]</a>: a new tax increase in their bill, when you're hitting them with a CPA tax, Community Preservation Act tax, for which the Commonwealth will not even meet its obligation to match the dollar for dollar that each rate payer is paying, because that's what the people voted on under that assumption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1850.039s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And now you may be hitting them with a connectivity fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1852.1s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's just not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1853.601s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So as Councilman Marks has alluded to, and hopefully the council will go along with it, I really think you need a complete assessment of all the water, all the sewer usage,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1862.578s">[Robert Penta]</a>: here in the city of Metro to get a better handle as it relates to what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1866.561s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's just a shame that your water and soil commissioners do not appear before this board to explain this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1872.186s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is really an involved process, but you're once again hitting the rate payers with another fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UJBcHvzH4YE&t=1879.071s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I would assume that that would be very hard to explain, very hard to explain when you're sitting on $7.5 million profit at the present time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mex41hYCPiQ&t=474.51s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, you just had a committee of the whole meeting tonight to talk about a new connectivity charge that is being proposed by the Water and Sewer Department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4617.706s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, a city that forgets about its history won't have any history.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4622.029s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And at the rate we're going in the city right now, the way developers have this opportunity to come in here, seize a piece of property, build upon it, and then take off and make a profit on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4632.407s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Perfect example is Luminaires on Locust Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4635.488s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Puts the building up, he's there a year, sells it for $61 million, and he's gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4640.51s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But we're talking about something right now is the history of our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4644.312s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And while Councilor Lungo-Koehn brings up this issue, whether it be 18 to 24 months, for which I would prefer 24, think of it like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4651.494s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Within the past three years, you folks in a concentrated area of South Street, Toro Ave, and Walnut Street have seen historical pieces of property<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4661.058s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and trees, if you're a lover of trees, and trees be demolished by out-of-towners, outsiders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4669.023s">[Robert Penta]</a>: People are only here to do one thing, and that's to make a profit on the piece of property and beg upon the people to maybe sell their property, make a big profit, and leave town so they can take over, make some money, and they can leave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4681.872s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4683.132s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We heard one of your Councilors indicate that the last time you people submitted a report in October,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4688.908s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It went from October to January and then it got lost somewhere in translation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4693.411s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That in and of itself is the telltale sign of what this city administration thinks about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4698.195s">[Robert Penta]</a>: preserving its history, preserving the history of neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4702.337s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And speaking about neighborhoods, when you lose zoning in your neighborhoods, whether it's for an historical purpose or what have you, you've lost the character of your neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4711.981s">[Robert Penta]</a>: South Boston, if you've been following this for the last two weeks, is a perfect example where the residents have gotten together on the development of a gentleman who wants to come in there and take over a piece of property<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4722.765s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that's perfectly zoned for what he wants to do, but the neighbors are opposed to it because it doesn't fit the character of the neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4731.592s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The state representative from that area, Michael Flaherty, has proposed a piece of legislation, and I believe he's doing it tomorrow morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4737.717s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He's proposing a piece of legislation that the character of the neighborhood has to be kept in line for that for which is there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4743.301s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It cannot be made to look anything different or obnoxious or something that's not satisfying to the public or to the people in that neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4752.102s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, we're not going to be here in a few years, because however God decides to take us, and when he decides to take us, so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4759.448s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you guys and girl, you have an opportunity here to make the legacy of this community continue to go forward in a positive way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4766.993s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If the city administration doesn't want to have the same eye on the prize, then you people should have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4772.758s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the zoning should be changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4774.279s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the 24 months should be changed, because you'll tell you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4777.261s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If a developer comes in here and finds out that he might have to wait 24 months to get that piece of property zoned or done for whatever he needs to do, he might think one of two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4787.929s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Number one, I'm going to work with the people, or I'm getting out of here because I don't want to deal with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4792.092s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you know something?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4792.733s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's probably the best thing, because he's not the real person that should be here for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4796.676s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And isn't it interesting that all the people that are coming into the city are out-of-towners?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4801.535s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've got to thank the people who took up the charge on Locust Street to bring it to court, to challenge the developer, for which finally found itself before your body and you folks, likewise, to challenge the developer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4815.757s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The neighborhood that took on the Salem Street, the Breakpro project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4821.54s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The neighborhood people had to bring it together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4823.761s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Not the city administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4825.502s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know how many more black eyes that this city administration needs to get to find out what its history is all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4831.245s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you certainly are making history by destroying pieces of property that have not only historical value, they have a family and a personal and a community value.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4842.351s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Do the right thing tonight, ladies and gentlemen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4844.613s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Vote for the 24 months, because within that 24 months, you can bargain or they can bargain with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4850.457s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But at least the people of this community will know that as an elected official, at least you folks, as a city councilor, are doing the right thing in behalf of the taxpayers of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9419.559s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The path is kind of ironic about this is your projected rates this year for your water and sewer are being reduced by approximately 2.77%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9428.356s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if the Water and Sewer Commission has given you a 2.77 projected rate decrease for combined water and sewer, and as you said, Councilor Marks, they're sitting on $8.5 million in the surplus, why would they now want to go out and hit you with a connectivity fee on a quarterly basis?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9445.264s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you check any cities and towns, most of them that have a connectivity fee, it's a one-time fee, and that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9453.508s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's at the discretion of the Director of Public Works or the town administrator<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9528.725s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think your vote should take place here tonight that you're not going to approve it, and you're not going to be supportive of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9534.706s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have a meeting on May 2nd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9536.166s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, you have an $8.5 million surplus, and you have a projected rate decrease in your water and sewer rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9543.087s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, you go out and explain that to the ratepayer of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9546.728s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Wait a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9547.228s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Please answer me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9548.588s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Explain to me, are any one of the, how do you have a rate decrease when you want to charge a new increase?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9555.37s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have the CPA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9556.731s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It will be explained on May 2nd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9558.071s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have the CPA as a corollary tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9559.872s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On May 2nd, there's a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9560.952s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9561.653s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have a corollary tax, the CPA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9563.653s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The Commonwealth of Massachusetts is not even going to meet it, not even match it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9566.654s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I did not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9566.914s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You should not be charging the taxpayers that money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9569.615s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was voted on by the citizens of the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9571.596s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the citizens and you guys can make a representative, you can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9574.277s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Order, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9575.277s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have order here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9577.078s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know what the order was when you and Councilor Dello Russo ran around when the people were talking?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9582.282s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know something, Mr. President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9585.044s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, trying to keep order with some folks who were just intentionally, they have no sense of respect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9594.511s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They have no respect for people at the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9596.553s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I understand that, Mr. President, but I do have the podium right now and I have an opportunity to say what I want to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9602.917s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay, and I'm sticking to the subject matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9604.579s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the subject matter is the water, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9606.58s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I'm saying to you, as president of this council, your message back to the Water and Soil Commission should be, we are not going to be any supportive of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9613.525s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When Councilmarks gets the minutes of that meeting and they find out how and why they want to keep taxing the people of this community, it's you folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9620.47s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Your election is coming up this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9622.272s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You guys are going to be paying for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10176.098s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Name and address of the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10177.418s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert Pantazero, Summit Road, Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10179.718s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Number one, I would be opposed to this bill if I was sitting on that side of the rail, because number one, I think this is an infringement upon the free enterprise system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10186.92s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The Board of Health has a job to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10189.04s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They go out there, they review the product of the restaurant,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10192.74s">[Robert Penta]</a>: or whatever it might be, that's their job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10194.722s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And for them to start taking an arbitrary and capricious action by placing a, A, B, or C on the type of business that's taking place, who are they?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10202.91s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They don't frequent that business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10204.132s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think it would lead a very, uh, it would, it would skew.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10208.953s">[Robert Penta]</a>: the public to go into a certain direction to say one business might be better than another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10213.077s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, this is just as bad as municipal aggregation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10216.82s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, you're asking city government to get involved in people's lives, their personal lives, and in this situation, their personal life is a personal business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10243.548s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When they go and do their job, and they review a restaurant, and they get a certificate on there that says it's been approved, whether it's a milk license, a common ventures license, or any kind of food product license, that's the city or the town telling you that that place has passed the test.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10257.951s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They don't need to have a rating system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10261.08s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When you start getting into a rating system, well, maybe we should have departments come down here and rate you guys and girls on the performance of your jobs, OK?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10269.223s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're really crossing over the line on something like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10272.525s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have a department that does its job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10274.746s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And its job is to go out there and to ensure that the food product in a business is safe, it's good to eat,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10282.92s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10284.041s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And now if you're going to start putting a rating system on it, I think you're really crossing over the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10288.123s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, people spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to go into a food business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10293.405s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if that person upstairs, man or female, who happens to work for the health department, just doesn't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10298.708s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They might pass the test, but they may not like the person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10301.852s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're getting into a personality conflict.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10303.874s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How many times have you folks gotten phone calls from people that have a business because they don't like a department head that comes in there and gives them a hard time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10313.464s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's a personality conflict.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10315.146s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's got nothing to do with the business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10317.168s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would strongly suggest that this does not go forward and you leave it just the way it is as a private sector business person coming to the city and applying for their license.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10326.494s">[Robert Penta]</a>: However it is, they go there, they do their job, but their business takes care of itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10330.597s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Their product sold to the public will take care of itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10333.719s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We don't need any city administration telling a business person that owns a restaurant how they should be rated by this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4540.88s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of the circus party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4544.981s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, a city that forgets about its history won't have any history.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4549.281s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And at the rate we're going in the city right now, the way developers have this opportunity to come in here, seize a piece of property, build upon it, and then take off and make a profit on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4559.696s">[Robert Penta]</a>: perfect example is Luminaires on Locust Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4562.779s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Puts the building up, he's there a year, sells it for $61 million, and he's gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4567.783s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But we're talking about something right now is the history of our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4571.606s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And while Councilman Uncle Kern brings up this issue, whether it be 18 to 24 months, for which I would prefer 24, think of it like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4578.772s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Within the past three years, you folks in a concentrated area of South Street, Toro Ave, and Walnut Street have seen historical pieces of property<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4588.344s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And trees, if you're a lover of trees, and trees be demolished by out of towners, outsiders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4596.307s">[Robert Penta]</a>: People are only here to do one thing and that's to make a profit on the piece of property and beg upon the people to maybe sell their property, make a big profit and leave town so they can take over, make some money and they can leave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4609.152s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4610.413s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We heard one of your Councilors indicate that the last time you people submitted a report in October,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4616.193s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It went from October to January, and then it got lost somewhere in translation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4620.674s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That, in and of itself, is the telltale sign of what this city administration thinks about preserving its history, preserving the history of neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4629.617s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And speaking about neighborhoods, when you lose zoning in your neighborhoods, whether it's for an historical purpose or what have you, you've lost the character of your neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4639.259s">[Robert Penta]</a>: South Boston, if you've been following this for the last two weeks, is a perfect example where the residents have gotten together on the development of a gentleman who wants to come in there and take over a piece of property that's perfectly zoned for what he wants to do, but the neighbors are opposed to it because it doesn't fit the character of the neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4658.866s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The state representative from that area, Michael Flaherty, has proposed a piece of legislation, and I believe he's doing it tomorrow morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4664.993s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He's proposing a piece of legislation that the character of the neighborhood has to be kept in line for that for which is there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4670.578s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It cannot be made to look anything different or obnoxious or something that's not satisfying to the public or to the people in that neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4679.37s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, we're not going to be here in a few years, because however God decides to take us, and when he decides to take us, so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4686.716s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you guys and girl, you have an opportunity here to make the legacy of this community continue to go forward in a positive way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4694.262s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If the city administration doesn't want to have the same eye on the prize, then you people should have it, and the zoning should be changed, and the 24 months should be changed, because you tell you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4704.53s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If a developer comes in here and finds out that he might have to wait 24 months to get that piece of property zoned or done for whatever he needs to do, he might think one of two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4715.213s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Number one, I'm going to work with the people or I'm getting out of here because I don't want to deal with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4719.374s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you know something?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4719.995s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's probably the best thing because he's not the real person that should be here for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4723.956s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And isn't it interesting that all the people that are coming into the city are out-of-towners?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4728.807s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've got to thank the people who took up the charge on Locust Street to bring it to court, to challenge the developer for which finally found itself before your body and you folks likewise challenged the developer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4743.026s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The neighborhood that took on the Salem Street, the Breakpro project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4748.809s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The neighborhood people had to bring it together, not the city administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4752.791s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know of any more black eyes that this city administration needs to get to find out what its history is all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4758.534s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you certainly are making history by destroying pieces of property that have not only historical value, they have a family and a personal and a community value.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4769.62s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Do the right thing tonight, ladies and gentlemen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4771.882s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Vote for the 24 months, because within that 24 months, you can bargain or they can bargain with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4777.726s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But at least the people of this community will know that as an elected official, at least you folks, as a city councilor, are doing the right thing on behalf of the taxpayers of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=4788.633s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9209.231s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9341.312s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9343.094s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert Penter, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass, former member of this board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9346.557s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The part that's kind of ironic about this is your projected rates this year for your water and sewer are being reduced by approximately 2.77%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9355.366s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if the Water and Sewer Commission has given you a 2.77 projected rate decrease for combined water and sewer,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9363.317s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as you said, Councilor Marks, if they're sitting on $8.5 million in a surplus, why would they now want to go out and hit you with a connectivity fee on a quarterly basis?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9372.26s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you check any cities and towns, most of them that have a connectivity fee, it's a one-time fee, and that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9380.504s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's at the discretion of the Director of Public Works or the Town Administrator, if you are a present homeowner, landowner, and you need to be reconnected,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9389.706s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There is no charge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9391.026s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It would be for a brand new person coming in, building a house, first time around, $50, one-time fee, usually anyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9408.893s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you for interrupting me, Councilor Dello Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9411.194s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9411.954s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is there anything else you want to do before I finish?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9415.244s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Would you smile on your face?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9416.385s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, let me tell you something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9418.946s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, when somebody's speaking up here, I don't need to be interrupted rudely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9422.829s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9423.97s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9425.111s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9425.631s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's the problem when people view something like this on the council floor and they watch it on television, that doesn't bode very well for you folks sitting here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9433.556s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9435.517s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I just think it's a shame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9442.176s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The point of order is talking about how this council is going to react.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9447.182s">[Robert Penta]</a>: with the rate increase of a connectivity fee that you're going to be putting on the taxpayers if it comes to be presented before you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9453.606s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't think you need to wait until May 2nd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9455.727s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think your vote should take place here tonight, that you're not going to approve it, and you're not going to be supportive of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9461.711s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When you have an $8.5 million, Mr. President, you have an $8.5 million surplus, and you have a projected rate decrease in your water and sewer rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9470.096s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now you go out and explain that to the right pair of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9473.719s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Wait a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9474.219s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Please answer me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9475.6s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Explain to me or anyone on the... How do you have a rate decrease when you want to charge a new increase?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9482.385s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have the CPA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9482.986s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It will be explained on May 2nd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9484.087s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have the CPA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9485.068s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have the CPA as a corollary tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9486.909s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On May 2nd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9487.97s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9488.65s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have a corollary tax, the CPA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9490.652s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The Commonwealth of Massachusetts is not even going to meet it, not even match it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9493.674s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I did not... You should not be charging the taxpayers that money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9496.637s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was voted on by the citizens of the... And the citizens and you guys can make a representative... You can...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9502.281s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have order here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9504.062s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know what the order was when you and Councilor Dello Russo ran around when the people were talking?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9508.165s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're talking about the water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9509.285s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know something, Mr. President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9512.047s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, trying to keep order with some folks who were just intentionally... They have no sense of respect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9520.532s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're talking about the water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9521.512s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They have no respect for people at the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9523.553s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I understand that, Mr. President, but I do have the podium right now and I have an opportunity to say what I want to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9529.917s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay, and I'm sticking to the subject matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9531.578s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the subject matter is the water, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9533.579s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I'm saying to you as president of this council, your message back to the Water and Soil Commission should be, we are not going to be any supportive of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9540.523s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When Councilmarks gets the minutes of that meeting and they find out how and why they want to keep taxing the people of this community, it's you folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9547.467s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Your election is coming up this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9549.268s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You guys are going to be paying for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10103.073s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Name and address of the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10104.394s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert Pentezero, Summit Road, Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10106.696s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Number one, I would be opposed to this bill if I was sitting on that side of the rail because, number one, I think this is an infringement upon the free enterprise system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10113.901s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The Board of Health has a job to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10115.642s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They go out there, they review the product of the restaurant or whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10120.485s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's their job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10121.705s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And for them to start taking an arbitrary and capricious action by placing an A, B, or C on the type of business that's taking place, who are they?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10129.895s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They don't frequent that business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10131.096s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think it would lead a very, it would skew.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10135.938s">[Robert Penta]</a>: the public to go into a certain direction to say one business might be better than another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10140.722s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, this is just as bad as municipal aggregation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10144.445s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're asking city government to get involved in people's lives, their personal lives, and in this situation, their personal life is a point of no business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10170.513s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When they go and do their job, and they review a restaurant, and they get a certificate on there that says it's been approved, whether it's a milk license, a common virtues license, or any kind of food product license, that's the city or the town telling you that that place has passed the test.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10184.94s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They don't need to have a rating system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10188.061s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When you start getting into a rating system, well, maybe we should have departments come down here and rate you guys and girls on the performance of your jobs, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10196.406s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're really crossing over the line on something like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10199.508s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have a department that does its job, and its job is to go out there and to ensure that the food product in the business is safe, it's good to eat,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10209.905s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10211.007s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And now if you're gonna start putting a rating system on it, I think you're really crossing over the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10215.092s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, people spend hundreds and thousands of dollars to go into a food business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10220.379s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if that person upstairs, man or female, who happens to work for the health department, just doesn't,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10225.686s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They might pass the test, but they may not like the person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10228.81s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're getting into a personality conflict.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10230.833s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How many times have you folks gotten phone calls from people that have a business because they don't like a department head that comes in there and gives them a hard time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10240.445s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's a personality conflict.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10242.107s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's got nothing to do with the business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10244.13s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would strongly suggest that this does not go forward and you leave it just the way it is as a private sector business person coming to the city and applying for their license.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10253.472s">[Robert Penta]</a>: However it is, they go there, they do their job, but their business takes care of itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10257.553s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Their product sold to the public will take care of itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10260.674s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We don't need any city administration telling a business person that owns a restaurant how they should be rated by this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=10868.713s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=64.517s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Name and address of the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=65.758s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Pentez, Zero Summit Road, Metford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=69.08s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm a former member of the Saugus party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=71.882s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I can appreciate what Councilor Lungelkern is going to because apparently<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=75.401s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think folks, as I was speaking to them today, were led to believe it was going to be next Tuesday evening, and here we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=81.043s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have nobody here from the fire department or the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=87.145s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if you go back and look at your capital improvement plan that was offered by the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=92.863s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The Mayor, there's quite a few locations and suggestions in here that raise itself well over $2.5 million as to where and how this is going to be funded as it relates to the fire station and into the police station part of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=105.716s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A lot of people don't even realize what just took place on the 14th of March, the day of the storm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=113.353s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The unfortunate circumstance, the fire department and the police department, their generator went out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=117.955s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Their backup generator to be supportive of their police operations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=122.277s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Their telecommunications, their communications back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=125.578s">[Robert Penta]</a>: From what I understand and I believe it to be true,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=128.525s">[Robert Penta]</a>: one if not maybe two of the doors of the fire department couldn't even be open because they had no electricity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=134.97s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Their backup generator, which apparently wasn't serviced like it should have been serviced, was out for a couple of days and they had to wait for a pot, and that's all because of what took place with the storm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=145.185s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You really have a whole host of issues here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=147.787s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You talk about a $2 billion seismic study for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=152.691s">[Robert Penta]</a>: None of you have gone through the reading of the over 690 pages of the $110,000 report that was submitted in January of 2013.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=164.211s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're going to be having here a little later this evening, because I see the superintendent here, and you're going to be having a discussion on something that relates to the high school in multi-millions of dollars, and you really need to ask the same question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=175.458s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're going to have a seismic erratic study for that piece of property up there too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=180.301s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it's unfair to the Medford taxpayer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=182.763s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Just like you folks, I am a taxpayer here in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=186.565s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The building was built in 1962.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=190.123s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Same thing with the high school, honor about in that same year of category, and they're looking for a major, major overhaul, if not reconstruction or additions to whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=201.312s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the question really needs to be asked, it's obvious that maintenance has not taken place in these buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=206.816s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You, Councilor Caraviello, if you remember correctly, I think it was your first term, the beginning of your first term, you indicated that the all new schools at that point in time, which were 11 years old, was a million point one in arrears for fixtures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=217.521s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And now it's still well in excess of a million, if not a million two, whatever it might be, 15 years later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=222.343s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you don't want to get caught into the same trap that you got caught in before to buy and fix new schools, whether you go from 12 to three or whatever the amount was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=230.246s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You built new schools because the old ones weren't maintained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=233.328s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you're going to be looking at the same argument that's going to be presenting itself<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=236.594s">[Robert Penta]</a>: as it relates to the high school later on this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=239.236s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But this is too important of an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=241.537s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're talking about at the outset, $22 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=244.78s">[Robert Penta]</a>: $2 million for the alleged, I don't know where that dollar amount came from, because I don't think any of you can answer how she came up with $2 million, and $20 million to pay for the station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=253.806s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as you heard here a couple of weeks ago when you had the director of finance up here, they're talking about 2022 before anything might be eligible for expiration of bonds that would be needed to pay for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=265.473s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I think in all fairness, as Councilor Longo-Kearns has alluded to, there's no reason to jump into this thing tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=272.741s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've waited a long period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=275.324s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You haven't even satisfied the argument of where the training center would go and the fire department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=280.13s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if we remember correctly, I think it was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=282.305s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When the first reading took place, because the fire department were here in mass numbers, the mayor decided to include them in any future development as to where they might go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=292.252s">[Robert Penta]</a>: To this date, the police department or its union have yet to be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=297.316s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you folks have yet to be involved in any type of involvement with this thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=301.119s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it just doesn't make sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=303.04s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not good political sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=304.541s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's absolutely not good financial sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=307.578s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, you have over $28 million in the deficit in your pension system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=311.58s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have an application, as you're well aware of, Mr. President, before the Massachusetts Library Association for $20 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=317.924s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if that comes through, the city of Medford pays 40% of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=320.925s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you're looking at probably approximately over the next two or three years, if in fact the high school goes forward and gets its application approved with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=330.099s">[Robert Penta]</a>: 20, $25 million there of taxpayers' money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=332.801s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're looking at a fire station and a police station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=335.983s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Can you please tell me who's going to pay for this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=339.184s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is nothing more than a leading to Proposition 2.5 override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=343.127s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you look at your sister city of Somerville,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=345.508s">[Robert Penta]</a>: With all the development that has taken place over there, they have still raised their taxes on two, a single two and three family homes, which goes to prove and tell you that development for the sake of development is not always in the best interest of this community or any community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=361.796s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You really need to look at the long-term approach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=364.77s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the long-term approach right now would say, one more week, I don't think is gonna make a big thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=370.132s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you know, you're people all talking about transparency and being fluid and having this conversation with the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=377.435s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, where is her olive branch extended to you to sit down and discuss and talk with you about this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=383.318s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=384.518s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=385.739s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what you're doing is the bottom line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=388.44s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what you're doing, you're just accelerating the use and the argument<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=393.478s">[Robert Penta]</a>: to have more people run for this city council and to run for mayor of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=397.8s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because people are sick and tired and fed, and fed up of being told about all these expenses and not being a part of it, not being included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=405.583s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the council, likewise, not including them in the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=409.604s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're not talking about $100,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=411.705s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're talking about $22,000,000 right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=415.547s">[Robert Penta]</a>: $2,000,000 for the study, $20,000,000 allegedly for the station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=419.329s">[Robert Penta]</a>: None of you can explain how it's gonna be paid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=421.89s">[Robert Penta]</a>: None of you can explain how she got to the $2,000,000 seismographic study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=425.351s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't even know if an RFQ went out, whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=428.813s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think the move is wrong tonight if you vote for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=431.654s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That sends the wrong message.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=433.295s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's definitely, definitely not taxpayer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=435.836s">[Robert Penta]</a>: People are police department friendly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=438.574s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=439.314s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5506.956s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Name and address of the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5508.437s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert Penter, Zero Summit Road, Medford Mass, former member of this board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5512.741s">[Robert Penta]</a>: With all due respect to the superintendent, I appreciate the fact that he was here knowing that in January that the application is out there and knowing that the school committee met, I believe a week before February 6th, it really doesn't give much time, whether it be for the school committee or even before the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5528.433s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, and this is something I believe, Mr. President, that you should have been advised of in a joint meeting between the school committee and the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5535.583s">[Robert Penta]</a>: While the council may have a lot of priorities and financial obligations to meet, that should be not an excuse or a red herring to say that's the reason why they didn't sit down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5544.015s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'll bring this out soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5545.316s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5545.937s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5546.497s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It doesn't make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5547.958s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The job is here to deal with everything that the city involves you with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5551.561s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Finances, education, whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5553.823s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you have to meet more than one night a week, wow, what a shame that would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5557.666s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maybe if you met three or four times a week and you made the mayor become involved in all of this and make you to become involved with this, you'd have a better handle on what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5566.385s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. Superintendent, you state on your document that you are submitting, you state, the school which is structurally unsound or otherwise in a condition seriously jeopardizing the health and safety of school children where no alternatives exist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5582.197s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You go on further to state that the renovation that took place in 2013 regarding the science labs for which the Medford City Council discussed on more than one night, I believe it was four times,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5593.88s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as a result of that, part of that was because of recertification with the Commonwealth of Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5598.341s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And further, the fact of the matter is that the building has not since then been renovated to meet ADA compliance standards and fire code standards that are needed to be current.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5609.105s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, how can our city allow that building right now not to go forward and have those requirements met?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5617.502s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That should be something that the school committee addresses on an annual basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5621.905s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's an everyday thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5622.786s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're talking about the safety of the children in the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5626.388s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You indicate at that point in time, you indicate that the fire code would be, it's approximately $1,200,000 to do an upgrade on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5635.475s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You also indicated that there is no way to close off the sections of the building<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5640.489s">[Robert Penta]</a>: to prevent citizens to enter restricted areas during non-school hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5644.51s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can go back to 1991, when I was sitting up there as president of the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5648.592s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that was an issue that was presented to us as it relates to out-of-towners coming to Medford High School that were not certified to be there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5655.354s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And in 2012, it was Councilman Marks who brought up the issue regarding the community schools on people coming in and out of the buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5662.816s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And now you're talking about maybe having a program that cuts down the entrances, where and how you can get in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5669.038s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can walk up to that high school right now at any point in time, after hours, and walk into that building, and there's nobody there to check you in or to check you out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5677.383s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's totally unfair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5678.164s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5679.865s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I can appreciate the fact that you might want to do all of these things now, but I beg the question, where has the school committee been on each and every one of these budgets, on each and every one of these years, especially on ADA compliance, especially on fire code compliance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5696.865s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's the thing that's necessary each and every day, that a child goes to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5701.172s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what you pay your taxes for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5702.894s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what a parent believes their elected officials are doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5705.979s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're making sure and ensuring that their children are protected when they go to school each and every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5713.885s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. Belson further stated, with all due respect, that in next year's budget he's going to put a dollar amount in there for school renovations or school upgradings, whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5724.288s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We've been talking about this thing for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5726.489s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The new school building program had a 5% annual charge that the city was supposed to put in each and every one of those new buildings to maintain themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5736.132s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And now, Councilor Caraviello, Mr. President, it's well over a million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5739.533s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The buildings are less than, they're going on 14 to 15 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5742.453s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're right back to where you were in the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5744.554s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's the reason why you had to build new schools, because the maintenance didn't take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5749.255s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Granted, Medford High School is a big school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5751.235s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a big school to take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5753.636s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you've got three roofs, three brand new roofs on that building, and now you're looking at a fourth one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5760.177s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The question then becomes, is the quality of the work not right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5765.968s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Are we not checking out to make sure that the quality of the work is not right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5769.65s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Are we just paying to have something done?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5774.212s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Another part that I really think that needs to take place to be discussed is the fact that, you know, this is such an important issue because this isn't a million dollars or two million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5786.258s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is well in excess of your $10 million, Councilor Marks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5790.08s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The school committee should be here sitting with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5793.393s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you, Mr. President, I would hope you would call for a joint meeting between the school committee to consider as you go forward on this particular project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5801.498s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You people got hit with this cold turkey tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5803.619s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You should have been called ahead of time to have a committee of the whole meeting to discuss it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5807.542s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's before the bodies, before the public here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5811.784s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And to shut off debate on millions of dollars being discussed is wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5817.487s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The debate was not shut off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5836.695s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if that be the case, that's a dollar, excuse me, Mr. President, that's a dollar amount attached to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5840.877s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because the application before the school building assistance program, no matter what they allow, is going to have a dollar amount attached to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5846.64s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That dollar amount has to be paid for by the city as to what portion of it they're going to accept, if not all of it or part of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5853.503s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a dollar amount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5855.044s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You should never shut off anybody, colleague or citizen, at the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5858.406s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is the only place you have an opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5859.987s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Nobody was shut off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5861.007s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I just said you should not shut off anyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5863.489s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There was an attempt to end debate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5865.27s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Nobody was shut off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5866.39s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I said there was an attempt to end debate, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5882.058s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5882.819s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert's Rules of Order also allows<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5885.187s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Public participation, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5886.687s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Public participation is allowed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5890.909s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What is that, a threat?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5894.73s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I have a right to say what I want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5897.751s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is a public forum, and I have a right to say what I want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5899.972s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5901.452s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5909.495s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5910.702s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, Mr. Belson also alluded to the fact that, and he's probably right in part, but he says we need to be partners with the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5917.185s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We need to be partners between and amongst ourselves, council, school committee people, to get the best of ideas that need to go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5923.048s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I can appreciate the fact that he wants to submit something now and you can't change it because the form is there, but it's been hanging around since January of this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5929.651s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's the sad part, since January of this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5932.18s">[Robert Penta]</a>: School committee allegedly only met once, if I understand that correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5935.483s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if that be the case to discuss it, they probably didn't have the same opportunities, and I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5939.946s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maybe the superintendent presented what he thought the priorities might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5942.568s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5943.389s">[Robert Penta]</a>: None of us know, because we haven't had that opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5945.911s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's why not having joint meetings with our other legislative body hurts the process that's before you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5951.836s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It hurts the idea that you can get a better idea as to why and how what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5956.079s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you get a better idea what the cost is going to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5958.361s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can get a better idea what the priorities are going to be, as the gentleman just came up here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5961.944s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. McAuliffe as he relates to the fact that how he has to run his business and what he has to plan for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5968.207s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No matter what the outcome is of this, whether they give you $1 million, $5 million, or $6 million, worthy, worthy of work to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5975.891s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You still have no priority program as it relates to any comprehensive financial program as to where this city is going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5983.234s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Police, fire, retirement board that needs to be paid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5986.898s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The deficit as it relates to the retirement fund, $28 million that the city has.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5991.703s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Again, nobody wants to discuss that and how you're going to go forward with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5994.867s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And more importantly, a fire and police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5996.829s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Does that mean now fire and police are going to be separated?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5999.672s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Or is it not going to be separated?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6001.533s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You haven't even gotten a final answer as it relates to the police department going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6005.374s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If they take down the station over there for the training tower, for the fire department, and you're going to go to a regional location, that's going to put the fire department at issue for backup because they're going to have to send their truck and their men to that regional location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6019.84s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A public safety issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6051.006s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6052.227s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, the Medford Public Schools<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6054.566s">[Robert Penta]</a>: as in the commentary from the superintendent, would like to meet with state and local governments as it relates to current code, including fire doors, fire alarms, sprinkler systems, and safety conditions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6065.78s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All things that right now are in potential violation are, if not in violation, as we presently speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6071.385s">[Robert Penta]</a>: After the new, I believe we all can remember, after the new science labs were built, there was a major problem for almost a year where a fire person had to be up at the high school because the fire system, the fire alarm system didn't work as it related to something happened, whether through the electrical department or what have you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6087.24s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then, if I understand this correctly,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6090.045s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And Mr. Belson's commentary, and I agree with you a hundred percent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6094.986s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You said any decision regarding the specific projects and the financial commitments would be developed over time and after multiple meetings within city government and at the state level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6106.95s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, at least he's got the ability to understand and recognize that city government officials need to sit down and discuss it much more than the person who calls herself the mayor of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6118.558s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is a big issue, whether you wanna realize it or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6122.021s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The building is 50 years old.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6123.682s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're talking about the same fire and police station that's down there right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6126.865s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maintenance didn't take place in the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6129.027s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now a lot of these things are maintenance driven, whether they be fire, whether they be the windows, whether they be the boiler or what have you, the asbestos.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6136.033s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a big building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6136.733s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it's four and a half miles long, Mr. Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6140.216s">[Robert Penta]</a>: 550,000 square feet, whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6142.858s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was built at a time to be a college campus type of a school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6148.002s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But that's not the point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6149.643s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're getting a lot of this all at once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6152.125s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maybe, to some degree, maybe, whether it's the cafeteria or whatever the auditorium is, maybe if you just stuck to the real desperate needs that the building has on a slow annual basis, you can look at these other things and put them into the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6168.175s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let me just remind you, and I'll just leave you with this last thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6171.076s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Just look at the city of Somerville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6172.717s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Look at all the development that's taken place over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6176.139s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All the development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6177.91s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6179.23s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Many, many more jobs and their taxes keep on going up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6184.412s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't have that opportunity here in the city of Medford, because if we're going to follow the mainstream of some of them and taxing the citizens of this community to pay for bond indebtedness that you can't afford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6196.356s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as council Marks and others alluded to, you're going to get yourself into a proposition two and a half override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6201.277s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It'll lose everyone behind this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6202.878s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I guarantee you will lose if you'll be supportive of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6205.279s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you're serving at that point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6207.267s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You need to plan ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6209.048s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And when you plan ahead, you'll be able to address these issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6212.07s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These have been long overdue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6213.41s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is a shame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6214.631s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Prior school committees ought to hang their head.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6216.732s">[Robert Penta]</a>: An embarrassment for allowing this to go this long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6219.433s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And so should the city of Medford, because that's been their downfall, letting their buildings run into a demise situation year in and year out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6227.678s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And now you're going to pay the price for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6229.619s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9501.575s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9501.915s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Name and address of the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9504.237s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass, former member of this board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9508.579s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I understand the resolution is adopted, but the question I would have is that, why would you want to charge somebody a connection fee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9518.625s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because right now, you pay from your house to the middle of the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9522.427s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So now you're saying that you connect<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9524.298s">[Robert Penta]</a>: to the city's lines for water and sewer, for which the city charges you for inflow and outflow of the water going through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9530.362s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have over $8.5 million in a surplus account that they can't figure out how and where it should be spent as it relates to infrastructure and water sewer lines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9540.609s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, if you want to talk about doing that for a commercial piece of property, that's one thing, because they're digging up the street and there's a linkage fee that's attached to it as it relates to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9549.194s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But on single-family homes,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9550.967s">[Robert Penta]</a>: two family homes or whatever it might be, you're already charging the homeowners, already paying for that hookup from the middle of the street to the house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9559.309s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I think what you need is probably a further clarification as it relates to where it's going on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9565.23s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think this begs the question, where are you going with your $8.5 million in the surplus account?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9570.231s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where's the infrastructure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9571.172s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where's the LNI that's taking place in the city?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9574.112s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where are the projects that have been sitting there that need to be addressed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9577.592s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Before you start charging another fee, possibly, to the taxpayer in this community, I mean, you've got a CPA tax that the state isn't even going to give you a dime back, because they have no money to give it back to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9588.856s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you're technically putting another tax on the Medford resident taxpayer in this community, and they're getting nothing back for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9595.318s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you are charging them, and you don't even have a program set aside for what it's going to be used for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9600.559s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've got almost $8.5 million in water and sewer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9602.74s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've got close to $9 million in your free cash account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9606.482s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then they're talking about building all these new buildings that need to be built, that nothing can take place until after 2022, going into 2023 to free up the bonds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9615.085s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So what are you going to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9617.225s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Start taking from your free cash?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9619.286s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Or are you going to do an override of $2.5 for the taxpayers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9622.487s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Or are you going to start laying off people?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9624.847s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You just spent $14.4 million to build a new Department of Public Works building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9629.369s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't have enough men to do it, to work it on a daily basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9636.055s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The problem that I see, and it's just my opinion, that you folks have got no relationship with this mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9642.78s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You absolutely have nothing to do with her on anything in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9647.463s">[Robert Penta]</a>: She just uses you for whatever she wants, when she wants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9652.067s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Listen, if this is going to be cohesive in a working relationship, you people need to put your foot down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9656.69s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It only takes four of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9658.351s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Four of you have enough intestinal fortitude to tell the city administration enough is enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9665.005s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because I'll tell you right now, you folks keep going in this direction, your election this November is going to have a different audience out there and behind this rail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9672.73s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because people are fed up with the fact that they're paying for something, they're not getting it, there's no cooperation, there's no fluidness, there's no transparency, and there's no honesty coming out of this building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=9684.717s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=199.89s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=201.131s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Pentez, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=204.433s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm a former member of the Saugus Party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=207.235s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I can appreciate what Councilor Lungelkorn is going to because apparently, I think folks, as I was speaking to them today, were led to believe it was going to be next Tuesday evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=215.888s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And here we are, we have nobody here from the fire department or the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=222.569s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if you go back and look at your capital improvement plan that was offered by the mayor, there's quite a few locations and suggestions in here that raised itself well over two and a half million dollars as to where and how this is going to be funded as it relates to the fire station and into the police station part of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=241.093s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, a lot of people don't even realize what just took place on the 14th of March<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=246.884s">[Robert Penta]</a>: the day of the storm, the unfortunate circumstance down the fire department and the police department, their generator went out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=253.369s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Their backup generator to be supportive of their police operations, their telecommunications, their communications back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=261.034s">[Robert Penta]</a>: From what I understand and I believe it to be true, one if not maybe two of the doors of the fire department couldn't even be open because they had no electricity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=270.3s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And their backup generator, which apparently wasn't serviced like it should have been serviced,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=274.458s">[Robert Penta]</a>: was out for a couple of days and they had to wait for a pot, and that's all because of what took place with the storm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=280.543s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You really have a whole host of issues here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=283.124s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You talk about a $2 billion seismic study for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=288.048s">[Robert Penta]</a>: None of you have gone through the reading of the over 690 pages of the $110,000 report that was written in January, submitted in January of 2013.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=296.915s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're going to be having here<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=301.613s">[Robert Penta]</a>: a little later this evening, because I see the superintendent here, and you're going to be having a discussion on something that relates to the high school in multi-millions of dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=309.376s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you really need to ask the same question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=310.857s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're going to have a seismic erratic study for that piece of property up there, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=315.018s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, I think it's unfair to the Medford taxpayer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=318.179s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Just like you folks, I am a taxpayer here in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=321.981s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The building was built in 1962.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=325.542s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Same thing with the high school, honor about in that same year of category.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=329.026s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And they're looking for a major, major overhaul, if not reconstruction or additions to whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=336.754s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the question really needs to be asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=338.796s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's obvious that maintenance has not taken place in these buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=342.228s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You, Councilor Caraviello, if you remember correctly, I think it was your first term, the beginning of your first term, you indicated that the all new schools at that point in time, which are 11 years old, was a million point one in arrears for fixtures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=352.994s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And now it's still well in excess of a million, if not a million two, whatever it might be, 15 years later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=357.737s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you don't want to get caught into the same trap that you got caught in before to buy and fix new schools, whether you go from 12 to three or whatever the amount was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=365.662s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You built new schools because the old ones weren't maintained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=368.743s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you're going to be looking at the same argument that's going to be presenting itself<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=371.999s">[Robert Penta]</a>: as it relates to the high school later on this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=374.6s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But this is too important of an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=376.881s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're talking about at the outset $22 million, $2 million for the alleged, I don't know where that dollar amount came from because I don't think any of you can answer how she came up with $2 million, and $20 million to pay for the station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=389.168s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as you heard here a couple of weeks ago when you had the director of finance up here, they're talking about 2022 before anything might be eligible for expiration of bonds that would be needed to pay for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=400.842s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I think in all fairness, as Councilor Lungo-Koehn has alluded to, there's no reason to jump into this thing tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=408.106s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've waited a long period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=410.687s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You haven't even satisfied the argument of where the training center would go and the fire department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=415.469s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if we remember correctly, I think it was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=417.657s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When the first reading took place, because the fire department were here in mass numbers, the mayor decided to include them in any future development as to where they might go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=427.607s">[Robert Penta]</a>: To this date, the police department or its union have yet to be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=432.692s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you folks have yet to be involved in any type of involvement with this thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=436.496s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it just doesn't make sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=438.417s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not good political sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=439.919s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's absolutely not good financial sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=442.949s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, you have over $28 million in the deficit in your pension system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=446.931s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have an application, as you're well aware of, Mr. President, before the Massachusetts Library Association for $20 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=453.094s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if that comes through, the city of Medford pays 40% of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=456.295s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you're looking at probably approximately over the next two or three years, if in fact the high school goes forward and gets its application approved with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=465.49s">[Robert Penta]</a>: $25 million there of taxpayers' money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=468.194s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're looking at a fire station and a police station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=471.359s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Can you please tell me who's going to pay for this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=474.564s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is nothing more than a leading to Proposition 2.5 override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=478.53s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you look at your sister city of Somerville,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=480.913s">[Robert Penta]</a>: With all the development that has taken place over there, they have still raised their taxes on two, a single two and three family homes, which goes to prove and tell you that development for the sake of development is not always in the best interest of this community or any community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=497.186s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You really need to look at the long-term approach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=500.175s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the long-term approach right now would say, one more week, I don't think, is going to make a big thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=505.537s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you know, you're people all talking about transparency and being fluid and having this conversation with the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=512.78s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, where is there all a branch extended to you to sit down and discuss and talk with you about this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=518.663s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=519.863s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=521.084s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what you're doing is the bottom line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=523.785s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what you're doing, you're just accelerating the use and the argument<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=528.832s">[Robert Penta]</a>: to have more people run for this city council and to run for mayor of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=533.138s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because people are sick and tired and fed, and fed up of being told about all these expenses and not being a part of it, not being included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=540.948s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the council, likewise, not including them in the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=544.958s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're not talking about $100,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=547.059s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're talking about $22 million right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=550.222s">[Robert Penta]</a>: $2 million for the study, $20 million allegedly for the station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=554.685s">[Robert Penta]</a>: None of you can explain how it's going to be paid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=557.246s">[Robert Penta]</a>: None of you can explain how she got to the $2 million seismographic study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=560.689s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't even know if an RFQ went out, whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=564.151s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think the move is wrong tonight if you vote for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=566.993s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That sends the wrong message.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=568.634s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's definitely, definitely not taxpayer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=571.176s">[Robert Penta]</a>: People are police department friendly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=573.922s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=574.642s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5642.022s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Name and address of the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5643.502s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert Penter, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of this board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5647.803s">[Robert Penta]</a>: With all due respect to the superintendent, I appreciate the fact that he was here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5651.864s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Knowing that in January that the application is out there,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5655.078s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And knowing that the school committee met, I believe, a week before February 6th, it really doesn't give much time, whether it be for the school committee or even before the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5663.504s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, and this is something I believe, Mr. President, that you should have been advised of in a joint meeting between the school committee and the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5670.66s">[Robert Penta]</a>: While the council may have a lot of priorities and financial obligations to meet, that should be not an excuse or a red herring to say that's the reason why they didn't sit down or bring this out sooner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5680.387s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not right, it's not fair, it doesn't make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5683.048s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The job is here to deal with everything that this city involves you with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5686.651s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Finances, education, whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5688.892s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you have to meet more than one night a week, wow, what a shame that would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5692.735s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maybe if you met three or four times a week and you made the mayor become involved in all of this and make you to become involved with this, you'd have a better handle on what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5701.46s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. Superintendent, you state on your document that you are submitting, you state, the school which is structurally unsound or otherwise in a condition seriously jeopardizing the health and safety of school children where no alternatives exist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5717.25s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You go on further to state that the renovation that took place in 2013 regarding the science labs for which the Medford City Council discussed on more than one night, I believe it was four times, and as a result of that, part of that was because of recertification with the Commonwealth of Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5733.438s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And further, the fact of the matter is that the building has not since then been renovated to meet ADA compliance standards and fire code standards that are needed to be current.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5744.169s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, how can our city allow that building right now not to go forward and have those requirements met?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5752.576s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That should be something that the school committee addresses on an annual basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5756.98s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's an everyday thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5757.88s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're talking about the safety of the children in the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5761.463s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You indicate at that point in time, you indicate that the fire code would be approximately $1,200,000 to do an upgrade on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5767.288s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You also indicated<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5771.942s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that there is no way to close off the sections of the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5775.543s">[Robert Penta]</a>: to prevent citizens to enter restricted areas during non-school hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5779.565s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can go back to 1991, when I was sitting up there as president of the council, and that was an issue that was presented to us as it relates to out-of-towners coming to Medford High School that were not certified to be there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5790.411s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And in 2012, it was Councilman Marks who brought up the issue regarding the community schools on people coming in and out of the buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5797.875s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And now you're talking about maybe having a program that cuts down the entrances, where and how you can get in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5804.103s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can walk up to that high school right now at any point in time, after hours, and walk into that building, and there's nobody there to check you in or to check you out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5812.448s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's totally unfair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5813.228s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5814.929s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I can appreciate the fact that you might want to do all of these things now, but I beg the question, where has the school committee been on each and every one of these budgets, on each and every one of these years, especially on ADA compliance, especially on fire code compliance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5831.95s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's the thing that's necessary each and every day, that a child goes to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5836.253s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what you pay your taxes for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5837.974s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what a parent believes their elected officials are doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5841.056s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're making sure and ensuring that their children are protected when they go to school each and every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5848.423s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. Belson further stated, with all due respect, that in next year's budget he's going to put a dollar amount in there for school renovations or school upgradings, whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5859.373s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We've been talking about this thing for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5861.555s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The new school building program had a 5% annual charge that the city was supposed to put in each and every one of those new buildings to maintain themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5871.204s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And now, Councilor Caraviello, Mr. President, it's well over a million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5874.607s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The buildings are less than, they're going on 14 to 15 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5877.549s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're right back to where you were in the beginning as the reason why you had to build new schools, because the maintenance didn't take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5884.335s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Granted, Medford High School is a big school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5886.337s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a big school to take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5888.739s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you've got three roofs, three brand new roofs on that building, and now you're looking at a fourth one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5895.925s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The question then becomes, is the quality of the work not right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5901.053s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Are we not checking out to make sure that the quality of the work is not right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5904.735s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Are we just paying to have something done?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5909.297s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Another part that I really think that needs to take place to be discussed is the fact that, you know, this is such an important issue because this isn't a million dollars or two million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5921.342s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is well in excess of your $10 million, Councilor Marks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5925.144s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The school committee should be here sitting with you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5928.478s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you, Mr. President, I would hope you would call for a joint meeting between the school committee to consider as you go forward on this particular project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5936.584s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You people got hit with this cold turkey tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5938.705s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You should have been called ahead of time to have a committee of the whole meeting to discuss it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5942.628s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's before the bodies, before the public here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5946.871s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And to shut off debate on millions of dollars being discussed is wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5971.779s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if that be the case, that's a dollar amount attached to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5975.961s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because the application before the school building assistance program, no matter what they allow, is going to have a dollar amount attached to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5981.724s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That dollar amount has to be paid for by the city as to what portion of it they're going to accept, if not all of it or part of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5988.567s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a dollar amount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5990.108s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You should never shut off anybody, colleague or citizen, at the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5993.49s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is the only place you have an opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5995.071s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Nobody was shut off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5996.091s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I just said you should not shut off anyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5998.573s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There was an attempt to end debate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6000.334s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Nobody was shut off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6001.454s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I said there was an attempt to end debate, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6017.143s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6017.904s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert's Rules of Order also allows<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6020.258s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Public participation, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6021.758s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Public participation is allowed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6023.579s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't want to hear it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6025.979s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What is that, a threat?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6032.2s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is a public forum, and I have a right to say what I want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6035.481s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6036.941s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6044.563s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6045.787s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, Mr. Belson also alluded to the fact that, and he's probably right in part, but he says we need to be partners with the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6052.252s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We need to be partners between and amongst ourselves, council, school committee people, to get the best of ideas that need to go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6058.116s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I can appreciate the fact that he wants to submit something now and you can't change it because the form is there, but it's been hanging around since January of this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6064.721s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's the sad part, since January of this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6067.244s">[Robert Penta]</a>: School committee allegedly only met once, if I understand that correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6070.547s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if that be the case to discuss it, they probably didn't have the same opportunities, and I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6075.01s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maybe the superintendent presented what he thought the priorities might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6077.632s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6078.453s">[Robert Penta]</a>: None of us know, because we haven't had that opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6080.975s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's why not having joint meetings with our other legislative body hurts the process that's before you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6086.899s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It hurts the idea that you can get a better idea as to why and how it's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6091.201s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You get a better idea what the cost is going to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6093.402s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can get a better idea what the priorities are going to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6095.602s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As the gentleman just came up here, Mr. McAuliffe, as he relates to the fact of how he has to run his business and what he has to plan for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6103.266s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No matter what the outcome is of this, whether they give you $1 million, $5 million, or $6 million, worthy, worthy of work to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6110.957s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You still have no priority program as it relates to any comprehensive financial program as to where this city is going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6118.288s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Police, fire, retirement board that needs to be paid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6121.951s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The deficit as it relates to the retirement fund, $28 million that the city has.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6126.754s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Again, nobody wants to discuss that and how you're going to go forward with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6129.917s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And more importantly, a fire and police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6131.898s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Does that mean now fire and police are going to be separated?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6134.72s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Or is it not going to be separated?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6136.601s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You haven't even gotten a final answer as it relates to the police department going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6140.423s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If they take down the station over there for the training tower for the fire department, and you're going to go to a regional location, that's going to put the fire department at issue for backup, because they're going to have to send their truck and their men to that regional location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6154.91s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A public safety issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6186.068s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6187.269s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, the Medford Public Schools<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6190.216s">[Robert Penta]</a>: as in the commentary from the superintendent, would like to meet with state and local governments as it relates to current code, including fire doors, fire alarms, sprinkler systems, and safety conditions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6200.833s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All things that right now are in potential violation are, if not in violation, as we presently speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6206.456s">[Robert Penta]</a>: After the new, I believe we all can remember, after the new science labs were built, there was a major problem for almost a year where a fire person had to be up at the high school because the fire system, the fire alarm system didn't work as it related to something happened, whether through the electrical department or what have you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6222.303s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then, if I understand this correctly, in Mr. Belson's commentary,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6228.352s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I agree with you 100%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6230.033s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You said any decision regarding the specific projects and the financial commitments would be developed over time and after multiple meetings within city government and at the state level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6242.017s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, at least he's got the ability to understand and recognize that city government officials need to sit down and discuss it, much more than the person who calls herself the mayor of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6253.605s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is a big issue, whether you want to realize it or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6257.066s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The building is 50 years old.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6258.747s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're talking about the same fire and police station that's down there right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6261.928s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maintenance didn't take place in the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6264.089s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, a lot of these things are maintenance driven, whether they be fire, whether they be the windows, whether they be the boiler or what have you, the asbestos.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6271.092s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a big building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6271.793s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it's four and a half miles long, Mr. Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6275.274s">[Robert Penta]</a>: 550,000 square feet, whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6277.915s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was built at a time to be a college campus type of a school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6283.069s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But that's not the point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6284.69s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're getting a lot of this all at once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6287.172s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maybe, to some degree, maybe, whether it's the cafeteria or whatever the auditorium is that they... Maybe if you just stuck to the real desperate needs that the building has on a slow annual basis, you can look at these other things and put them into the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6303.242s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let me just remind you, and I'll just leave you with this last thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6306.144s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Just look at the city of Somerville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6307.785s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Look at all the development that's taken place over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6311.187s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All the development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6312.978s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6314.299s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Many, many more jobs, and their taxes keep on going up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6319.481s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't have that opportunity here in the city of Medford, because if we're going to follow the mainstream of Somerville and taxing the citizens of this community to pay for bond indebtedness that you can't afford, and as Council Marks and others have alluded to, you're going to get yourself into a Proposition 2.5 override, it'll lose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6336.748s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Everyone behind this council, I guarantee you, will lose if you'll be supportive of that, if you're serving at that point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6342.334s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You need to plan ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6344.095s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And when you plan ahead, you'll be able to address these issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6347.117s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These have been long overdue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6348.478s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is a shame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6349.678s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Prior school committees ought to hang their head in embarrassment for allowing this to go this long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6354.481s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And so should the city of Medford, because that's been their downfall, letting their buildings run into a demise situation year in and year out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6362.726s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And now you're going to pay the price for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9636.387s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9636.727s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Name and address of the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9639.067s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of this board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9643.388s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I understand the resolution is adopted, but the question I would have is that why would you want to charge somebody<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9652.583s">[Robert Penta]</a>: a connection fee, because right now you pay from your house to the middle of the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9657.226s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So now you're saying that you connect to the city's lines for water and sewer, for which the city charges you for inflow and outflow of the water going through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9665.891s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have over $8.5 million in a surplus account that they can't figure out how and where it should be spent as it relates to infrastructure and water-sewer lines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9675.4s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, if you want to talk about doing that for a commercial piece of property, that's one thing, because they're digging up the street, and there's a linkage fee that's attached to it as it relates to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9683.983s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But on single-family homes, two-family homes, or whatever it might be, you're already charging the homeowners, already paying for that hookup from the middle of the street to the house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9694.127s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I think what you need is probably a further clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9698.419s">[Robert Penta]</a>: as it relates to where it's going on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9700.04s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think this begs the question, where are you going with your $8.5 million in the surplus account?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9705.044s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where's the infrastructure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9705.985s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where's the LNI that's taking place in the city?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9708.927s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where are the projects that have been sitting there that need to be addressed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9712.41s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Before you start charging another fee, possibly, to the taxpayer in this community, I mean, you've got a CPA tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9719.494s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that the state isn't even going to give you a dime back, because they have no money to give it back to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9723.656s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you're technically putting another tax on the Medford resident taxpayer in this community, and they're getting nothing back for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9730.139s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you are charging them, and you don't even have a program set aside for what it's going to be used for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9735.381s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've got almost $8.5 million in water and sewer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9737.582s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've got close to $9 million in your free cash account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9741.304s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then you're talking about building all these new buildings that need to be built, that nothing can take place until after 2022,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9748.823s">[Robert Penta]</a>: going into 2023 to free up the bonds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9751.465s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So what are you going to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9752.166s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Start taking from your free cash?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9754.088s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Or are you going to do an override of two and a half with the taxpayers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9757.29s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Or are you going to start laying off people?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9759.652s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You just spent $14.4 million to build a new Department of Public Works building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9764.176s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't have enough men to do it, to work it on a daily basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9770.856s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The problem that I see, and it's just my opinion, that you folks have got no relationship with this mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9777.579s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You absolutely have nothing to do with her on anything in this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9782.261s">[Robert Penta]</a>: She just uses you for whatever she wants, when she wants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9786.862s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Listen, if this is going to be cohesive and a working relationship, you people need to put your foot down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9791.484s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It only takes four of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9793.145s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Four of you have enough intestinal fortitude to tell the city administration enough is enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9799.802s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because I'll tell you right now, you folks keep going in this direction, your election this November is going to have a different audience out there and behind this rail, because people are fed up with the fact that they're paying for something, they're not getting it, there's no cooperation, there's no fluidness, there's no transparency, and there's no honesty coming out of this building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9819.532s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9820.032s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5020.953s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, we agreed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5021.554s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Oh, OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5022.996s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Name and address of the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5024.136s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I wouldn't be that rude.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5025.697s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5026.597s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5026.937s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Pinter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5027.937s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I live at Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., a former member of the Saugus party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5032.078s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I have some concerns as it relates to whatever this agreement might be between the city and the fire department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5038.839s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the one glaring thing that stands out with me is that the mayor is going to appoint a committee of fire personnel to work as it relates to a new fire station or whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5050.082s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why didn't that take place for the police department?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5052.888s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If she's so concerned about the fire department, it's obvious that she was less concerned about the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5058.392s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's quite obvious by this particular writing here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5061.254s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's more obvious because of the fact that no one from rank and file of the police union were part and parcel of where we're going with all of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5069.619s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Second thing, as it relates to the location or relocation possibly of a new fire station, the chief is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5076.544s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He can answer for himself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5077.525s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But last night, he indicated that the present location is the best place for the fire<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5082.952s">[Robert Penta]</a>: location here in the city of Medford for its headquarters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5085.593s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So we take that into consideration because the talk seems to be supposedly getting a new fire station at a new location at a later time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5094.175s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then we go to point number four where the mayor says she's going to submit a loan order no later than the 2019 fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5102.697s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That brings you up to May of June of 2020, no later than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5108.119s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But all you're going to be getting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5109.678s">[Robert Penta]</a>: is allegedly a proposal for one, a new station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5113.68s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And number two, you know, maybe what the cost is going to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5117.142s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's no proviso in here as it's going to relate to how it's going to be paid for, whether it's going to be the Medford taxpayer, because we know right now there's no grants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5126.267s">[Robert Penta]</a>: She's still looking for grants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5127.508s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As she said last night, she's on the hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5129.609s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And in some places there's no grants to be found.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5132.651s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you're looking at Mr. And Mrs. Medford taxpayer who seems to be the person that's going to be paying it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5138.076s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I think you have some financial concerns that really need to be taken into consideration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5142.638s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Nothing that's been discussed right now is an obligation of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5146.08s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a, is it's approximate $28 million pension deficit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5150.182s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You folks haven't mentioned that yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5151.723s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And there's no upticking on paying that down at a faster rate because the interest rates keep going higher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5158.166s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The other night there was a contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5159.507s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There was a car, excuse me, there was a meeting as it relates to a multimillion dollar refurbishing of Medford high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5166.802s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's going to cost factor that's going to have to come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5169.604s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Most recently, this council voted on, and excitedly, for the Medford Library and a $20 million bond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5175.508s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if that comes through, there's a 40% payback on the city side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5179.791s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These are things that really have to be taken into consideration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5182.954s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you, President Caraviello, in your first term, on the second year of your first term, you introduced a document that talked about $1.3 million of necessary repairs on the six new schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5193.441s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's up to almost $1.5 million right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5196.724s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This city has a bad history of taking care of its buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5199.805s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The private administration ignored all these buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5202.985s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This city council is now being faced with altogether, all at once, a whole host of issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5209.527s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's obvious that the priorities have not been set.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5212.507s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the priorities of this particular mayor, her little baby, being this police department thing, and now with the fire department thrown in, she should be here discussing this and making her plea with you folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5224.63s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is totally unfair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5226.91s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You folks have never had an opportunity to discuss this issue, nevermind the location, nevermind the 35,000 square foot building, nevermind a three story building, nevermind the fact that if you put a combined operation there, according to Dunn and Sweeney, it won't even fit today's standards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5243.457s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you look at the 600 plus pages of the report, it alludes to the fact that even if you were to build a new police station and leave the fire station alone,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5251.981s">[Robert Penta]</a>: what you're going to have is you're going to have mechanical problems that also will have code problems that will not bone up for the next 20 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5259.764s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's going to be a cost factor to take into consideration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5263.105s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you're talking about a possible 10 to 18 month period or 10 to 12 month period for a designer to come in and an OPM person hired first, everyone keeps forgetting to say that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5273.789s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The OPM needs to be hired first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5276.389s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Once you put that together,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5278.763s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why wait and do an 18-month period for the fire?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5281.084s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why can't you do both at the same time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5283.505s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you do both at the same time, maybe you can work out a process that basically says you can build this station in increments as it relates to building a new police station and then working on the fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5296.21s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because we all know on the fire station side of the building, the building is probably in better shape and a better condition than the police side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5302.621s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But who's to say it isn't because nobody's gone through there and council logo hit it right in the head.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5306.504s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maybe you should go in there and have any equality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5308.386s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maybe that building should be reviewed for his aesthetic qualities and whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5313.37s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, running around, not having any money from the outside and only dealing with nine, approximately $9 million in your free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5321.317s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That doesn't leave, that doesn't leave an awful lot because then we can talk about your almost $8 million that you have in your water and sewer account for which Mr. And Mrs. Medford taxpayer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5331.39s">[Robert Penta]</a>: has been paying for, and a surplus just sits there, and there is no ongoing proposed work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5336.912s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you're hitting the taxpayers with that money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5339.233s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're also hitting the taxpayer with the CPA, the Community Preservation Act, which in effect is almost $1 million plus you're taking away from the taxpayers, and there is no known program for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5350.978s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So how much can you keep going back to Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer and say to them,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5355.72s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're charging you for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5357.1s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is what the cost is going to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5358.961s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And readily acknowledged by our own treasurer, the fact of the matter is there's going to be some deficit mode as you continue to go forward that's going to have to be offset.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5367.524s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Who's going to pay for it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5369.024s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Do you really want to tell the taxpayer you need a Proposition 2.5 override?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5373.766s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Do you really want to sell that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5375.766s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if everything comes before you, Mr. President, and before your council,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5379.419s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5380.159s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where's the conversation as it relates to that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5382.721s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where's the priority going to be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5383.982s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is it going to be the high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5385.383s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is it going to be the library?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5386.643s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is it going to be the police department?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5387.904s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is it going to be the fire station?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5389.945s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The fire chief made an excellent point, something I never even thought of, and thank you for bringing it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5394.748s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Talking about storage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5396.77s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you can't even store what you have on the property that you have right now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5401.18s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where in God's creation are you going to put that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5403.322s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He said possibly auctioning it off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5404.883s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Two bays you're going to possibly be losing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5407.284s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You talked about regionalization the other night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5409.426s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The mayor readily said that we could possibly go to regionalization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5413.149s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I believe we heard the fire department indicate and say to you that if we did go to regionalization and we did take one of our trucks and a group of our guys to go there,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5420.674s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and to do whatever it might takes place at one of these fire academies, so to speak, there needs to be a backup here in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5427.556s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And where's the backup to the backup in the city?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5429.637s">[Robert Penta]</a>: God forbid there's a major fire that takes place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5432.418s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These are things that haven't been discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5434.438s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what you folks should be discussing before you rush into this thing and say we want to go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5439.18s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There is nobody, not one person in this room that would be against a fire in the police station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5443.321s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't think there's anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5444.222s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It would all be crazy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5445.682s">[Robert Penta]</a>: if there was one person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5446.663s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We all recognize the fact that the need is there, but we also recognize the fact that the city has been extremely diligent in not maintaining its buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5454.849s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But there needs to be a priority that's set.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5457.532s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There has to be a goal set here, and there has to be a timeline met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5461.575s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if it's 2022 that was stated last night, now it's up to 2024 before you start to be making these paybacks, what's the cost going to be as it relates to the new station?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5472.804s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. McCulloch made an excellent point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5474.785s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the point is simply this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5476.567s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you have to buy another piece of property for $10 million, is the at-present property worth $10 million?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5481.551s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Are thereabouts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5482.612s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if it isn't, but it comes close to it, and between the sale and the taxes that it generates, it offsets the cost of where you might be going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5490.298s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These are things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5491.038s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I thank you folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5491.839s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it was you, Councilor Lungo-Koehn, who asked to maybe go into executive session to find out who are these other people that the city sat down and spoke with as it relates to possibly moving it around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5502.823s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You seem to forget one thing as it relates to where the public works department is, because we can't put any equipment in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5508.907s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the new public works building was being discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5511.369s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What was discussed before this council was building something that could be oversized, not only to handle public works, but to handle our other buildings, whether it be our fire trucks, our police cars, and whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5523.236s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And there was a pushback by the then administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5526.058s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why there was a pushback, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5528.12s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And there was also a thought process that told us we could just wrap the whole thing around public works, fire, and police.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5534.506s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And all you would be doing is asking and moving people that are presently there without taking their property, moving their property, so nobody would lose any space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5542.694s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As a matter of fact, they'd probably have better space, they'd have front view space, but you'd still have the availability of a fire department that's right there in the middle of the square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5551.982s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Police department, maybe move back a little bit one way or the other, but they can get around with their cars a lot quicker than a fire truck could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5559.27s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't think you should make a mistake by saying, no, we're not going to vote for this or yes, we're going to vote for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5564.694s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5566.315s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And once again, the process has been broken down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5569.116s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's been broken down because there's been no communication, a lack of leadership from the mayor's office with this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5575.661s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And all you folks are being required to do is to vote for this thing up and down with absolutely not an ounce of input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5582.594s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And today is another perfect example of what took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5585.455s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If the fire department can meet with the mayor to get this resolution between themselves, then why wasn't the council involved before or after?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5594.978s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And who's to say that this mayor is going to be here in 18 months?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5599.34s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5600.841s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's what you need to ask yourself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5602.763s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So why are you going out on 18 months when in fact, if you're going to be doing this thing for a police department, why don't you do it for a fire department at the same time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5611.41s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That way they'll have a better understanding and a better acknowledgement to the fact where the fire and police can be housed together like they were in 1962 and like the report said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5621.058s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That report of multiple pages from Dunham and Sweeney going back to 2013 is probably the best example that you can have to tell you and to show you why a dual building should work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5632.187s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if not, and you decide to go separately in a separate way, that generates and should generate positive discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5638.832s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And one last thing for Mr. Falco, Councilor Falco.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5641.954s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When you talked about that training tower, while it seems to be something that, you know, it's going to be there and might cost $500,000,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5649.8s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But where in the city is it going to be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5651.921s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you don't want that to be regionalized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5653.422s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because if you want that regionalized, you're taking firefighters out of service, out of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5657.803s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're taking a truck out of our service, out of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5660.364s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're putting backup there, and there's nobody there for the backup.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5663.706s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's the problem that we're going to have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5665.187s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5665.827s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7133.175s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You do not get into the roll call vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7140.305s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He can speak as many times as he wants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7141.865s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, you just don't like me, so that's your problem, Councilor Dello Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7145.427s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The people out there have elected you people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7147.707s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're voting on the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7149.328s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On your motion, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7151.848s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7152.469s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But apparently, as Councilor Longo-Kearns alluded to, it is contradictory to the point number C. Councilor Longo-Kearns, there's a resolution that will go to the mayor's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7168.608s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not the mayor's privilege.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7170.409s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's the council's privilege.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7172.39s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's your prerogative, not the mayor's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7177.233s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On the loan order in and of itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7178.914s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's your prerogative, not the mayor's prerogative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7182.676s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you've already voted on point number C, which is contradictory to the main motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7187.739s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We are voting on the loan order, Councilor Penta.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4603.02s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Oh, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4604.482s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Name and address of the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4605.602s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I wouldn't be that rude.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4607.183s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4608.063s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4608.423s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Pinter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4609.423s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I live at Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., a former member of the Saugus party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4613.544s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I have some concerns as it relates to whatever this agreement might be between the city and the fire department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4620.325s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the one glaring thing that stands out with me is that the mayor is going to appoint a committee of fire personnel to work as it relates to a new fire station or whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4631.548s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why didn't that take place for the police department?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4634.354s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If she's so concerned about the fire department, it's obvious that then she was less concerned about the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4639.878s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's quite obvious by this particular writing here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4642.74s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's more obvious because of the fact that no one from rank and file of the police union were part and parcel of where we're going with all of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4651.106s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Second thing, as it relates to the location or relocation possibly of a new fire station, the chief is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4658.031s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He can answer for himself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4659.012s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But last night, he indicated that the present location is the best place for the fire<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4664.415s">[Robert Penta]</a>: location here in the city of Medford for its headquarters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4667.076s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So we take that into consideration because the talk seems to be supposedly getting a new fire station at a new location at a later time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4675.658s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then we go to point number four where the mayor says she's going to submit a loan order no later than the 2019 fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4684.18s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That brings you up to May of June of 2020, no later than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4689.582s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But all you're going to be getting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4691.142s">[Robert Penta]</a>: is allegedly a proposal for one, a new station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4695.144s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And number two, you know, maybe what the cost is going to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4698.626s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's no proviso in here as it's going to relate to how it's going to be paid for, whether it's going to be the Medford taxpayer, because we know right now there's no grants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4707.771s">[Robert Penta]</a>: She's still looking for grants, as she said last night, she's on the hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4711.113s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And in some places there's no grants to be found.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4714.155s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you're looking at Mr. And Mrs. Medford taxpayer who seems to be the person that's going to be paying it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4719.559s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I think you have some financial concerns that really need to be taken into consideration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4724.142s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Nothing that's been discussed right now is an obligation of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4728.004s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's approximate $28 million pension deficit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4731.686s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You folks haven't mentioned that yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4733.207s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And there's no upticking on paying that down at a faster rate because the interest rates keep going higher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4739.671s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The other night there was a contract, excuse me, there was a meeting as it relates to a multi-million dollar refurbishing of Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4748.268s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's going to cost factor that's going to have to come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4751.069s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Most recently, this council voted on, and excitedly, for the Medford Library and a $20 million bond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4756.97s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if that comes through, there's a 40% payback on the city side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4761.232s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These are things that really have to be taken into consideration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4764.412s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you, President Caraviello, in your first term, on the second year of your first term, you introduced a document that talked about $1.3 million of necessary repairs on the six new schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4774.895s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's up to almost a million point five right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4778.19s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This city has a bad history of taking care of its buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4781.272s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The private administration ignored all these buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4784.435s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This city council is now being faced with altogether, all at once, a whole host of issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4791.0s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's obvious that the priorities have not been set.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4793.982s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the priorities of this particular mayor, her little baby, being this police department thing, and now with the fire department thrown in, she should be here discussing this and making her plea with you folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4806.112s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is totally unfair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4808.38s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You folks have never had an opportunity to discuss this issue, never mind the location, never mind the 35,000 square foot building, never mind a three-story building, never mind the fact that if you put a combined operation there, according to Dunn and Sweeney, it won't even fit today's standards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4824.909s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you look at the 600 plus pages of the report, it alludes to the fact that even if you were to build a new police station and leave the fire station alone,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4833.459s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What you're going to have is you're going to have mechanical problems that also will have code problems that will not bone up for the next 20 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4841.226s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's going to be a cost factor to take into consideration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4844.569s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you're talking about a possible 10 to 18 month period or 10 to 12 month period for a designer to come in and an OPM person hired first, everyone keeps forgetting to say that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4855.258s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The OPM needs to be hired first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4857.861s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Once you put that together,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4860.229s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why wait and do an 18-month period?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4862.55s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why can't you do both at the same time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4864.971s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you do both at the same time, maybe you can work out a process that basically says you can build this station in increments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4873.395s">[Robert Penta]</a>: as it relates to building a new police station, and then working on the fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4877.658s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because we all know on the fire station side of the building, the building is probably in better shape and in better condition than the police side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4884.082s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But who's to say it isn't, because nobody's gone through there, and Councilor Longo hit it right in the head, maybe you should go in there and have any equality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4889.846s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maybe that building should be reviewed for its aesthetic qualities, and whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4894.849s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, running around not having any money from the outside, and only dealing with approximately $9 million in your free cash,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4903.522s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That doesn't leave an awful lot, because then we can talk about your almost $8 million that you have in your water and sewer account, for which Mr. and Mrs. Medford taxpayer has been paying for, and a surplus just sits there, and there is no ongoing proposed work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4918.392s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you're hitting the taxpayers with that money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4920.713s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're also hitting the taxpayer with the CPA, the Community Preservation Act, which in effect is almost $1 million plus you're taking away from the taxpayers, and there is no known program for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4932.437s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So how much can you keep going back to Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer and say to them, we're charging you for this, this is what the cost is going to be, and readily acknowledge by our own treasurer the fact that the matter is there's going to be some deficit mode as you continue to go forward that's going to have to be offset.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4948.983s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Who's going to pay for it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4950.504s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Do you really want to tell the taxpayer you need a Proposition 2.5 override?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4955.225s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Do you really want to sell that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4957.226s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if everything comes before you, Mr. President, before your council,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4960.885s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4961.626s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where's the conversation as it relates to that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4964.189s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where's the priority going to be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4965.45s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is it going to be the high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4966.851s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is it going to be the library?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4968.113s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is it going to be the police department?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4969.374s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is it going to be the fire station?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4971.416s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The fire chief made an excellent point, something I never even thought of, and thank you for bringing it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4976.221s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Talking about storage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4978.236s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you can't even store what you have on the property that you have right now, where in God's creation are you gonna put that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4984.781s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He said possibly auctioning it off, two bays you're gonna possibly be losing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4988.744s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You talked about regionalization the other night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4990.886s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The mayor readily said that we could possibly go to regionalization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=4994.608s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I believe we heard the fire department indicate and say to you that if we did go to regionalization and we did take one of our trucks and a group of our guys to go there and to do whatever it might takes place at one of these fire academies, so to speak,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5006.237s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There needs to be a backup here in this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5009.038s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And where's the backup to the backup in the city?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5011.098s">[Robert Penta]</a>: God forbid there's a major fire that takes place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5013.879s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These are things that haven't been discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5015.919s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what you folks should be discussing before you rush into this thing and say we want to go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5020.66s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There is nobody, not one person in this room that would be against a fire in a police station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5024.781s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't think there's anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5026.001s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We'd all be crazy if there was one person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5028.161s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We all recognize the fact that the need is there, but we also recognize the fact that the city has been extremely diligent and not maintaining its buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5036.323s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But there needs to be a priority that's set.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5039.004s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There has to be a goal set here, and there has to be a timeline met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5043.045s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if it's 2022 that was stated last night, now it's up to 2024 before you start to be making these paybacks, what's the cost going to be as it relates to the new station?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5054.288s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. McCulloch made an excellent point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5056.288s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the point is simply this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5058.048s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you have to buy another piece of property for $10 million, is the at-present property worth $10 million?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5063.049s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Are thereabouts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5064.089s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if it isn't, but it comes close to it, and between the sale and the taxes that it generates, it offsets the cost of where you might be going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5071.791s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These are things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5072.531s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I thank you folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5073.311s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it was you, Councilor Lungo-Koehn, who asked to maybe go into executive session to find out who are these other people that the city sat down and spoke with as it relates to possibly moving it around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5084.303s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You seem to forget one thing as it relates to where the public works department is, because we can't put any equipment in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5090.387s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the new public works building was being discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5092.849s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What was discussed before this council was building something that could be oversized, not only to handle public works, but to handle our other buildings, whether it be our fire trucks, our police cars, and whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5104.716s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And there was a pushback by the then administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5107.538s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why was there a pushback?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5108.699s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5109.6s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And there was also a thought process that told us we could just wrap the whole thing around public works, fire, and police.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5116.006s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And all you would be doing is asking and moving people that are presently there without taking their property, moving their property, so nobody would lose any space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5124.174s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As a matter of fact, they'd probably have better space, they'd have front view space, but you'd still have the availability of a fire department that's right there in the middle of the square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5133.483s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Police department, maybe move back a little bit one way or the other, but they can get around with their cars a lot quicker than a fire truck could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5140.79s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't think you should make a mistake by saying, no, we're not going to vote for this, or yes, we're going to vote for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5146.192s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5147.832s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And once again, the process has been broken down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5150.633s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's been broken down because there's been no communication, a lack of leadership from the mayor's office with this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5157.176s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And all you folks are being required to do is to vote for this thing up and down with absolutely not an ounce of input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5164.091s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And today is another perfect example of what took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5166.952s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If the fire department can meet with the mayor to get this resolution between themselves, then why wasn't the council involved before or after?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5176.477s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And who's to say that this mayor is going to be here in 18 months?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5180.859s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5182.36s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's what you need to ask yourself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5184.281s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So why are you going out on 18 months when in fact, if you're going to be doing this thing for a police department, why don't you do it for a fire department at the same time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5192.905s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That way they'll have a better understanding and a better acknowledgement to the fact where the fire and police can be housed together like they were in 1962 and like the report said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5202.568s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That report of multiple pages from Dunham and Sweeney going back to 2013 is probably the best example that you can have to tell you and to show you why<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5212.03s">[Robert Penta]</a>: a dual building should work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5213.692s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if not, and you decide to go separately in a separate way, that generates and should generate positive discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5220.32s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And one last thing for Mr. Falco, Councilor Falco, when you talked about that training tower, while it seems to be something that, you know, it's going to be there, it might cost $500,000,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5231.232s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But where in the city is it going to be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5233.353s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you don't want that to be regionalized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5234.853s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because if you want that regionalized, you're taking firefighters out of service, out of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5239.235s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're taking a truck out of our service, out of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5241.796s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're putting backup there, and there's nobody there for the backup.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5245.137s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's the problem that we're going to have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5246.878s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=5247.258s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=6723.065s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, you just don't like me, so that's your problem, Councilor Dello Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=6726.828s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The people out there have elected you people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=6729.19s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're voting on the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=6730.751s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On your motion, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=6733.253s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On the motion, but apparently, as Councilor Longo-Kearns alluded to, it is contradictory to the point number C. Councilor Longo-Kearns is a resolution that will go to the mayor's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=6750.04s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's the mayor's, it's not the mayor's privilege, it's the council's privilege.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=6753.821s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's your prerogative, not the mayor's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=6758.663s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On the loan order in and of itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=6760.343s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's your prerogative, not prerogative, not the mayor's prerogative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=6764.084s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you've already voted on point number C, which is contradictory to the main motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3997.699s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3999.02s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4000.141s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Penta, former member of the Zargas body, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4006.044s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'd like to go over some points that were brought up before the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4009.045s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The whole meeting wasn't televised, but it was probably a misreading on your part, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4014.548s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not a 3,500 square foot building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4016.769s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a 35,000 square foot building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4019.51s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4020.271s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Number two,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4021.379s">[Robert Penta]</a>: uh, in the report, it states it's going to be three story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4024.76s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And our good friend, the city solicitor has been quoted by saying that the mayor said she has decided where the building is going to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4031.782s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The sad part about this whole commentary is the mayor is proposing two and a half million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4038.743s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And we don't even know what the contingencies might be proposal here for the city of method.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4043.305s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This present city council, this will be the largest financial bonding that you folks are going to be doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4048.994s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And because of that, and because of that, I agree with Councilor Marks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4051.955s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The mayor should be here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4053.236s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is her proposal because when she announced when she was campaigning, it would be seven to eight years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4059.158s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Howard got sped up to this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4060.698s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know, but thankfully because of the police department going out there and, uh, and, and having their demonstrations and speaking up and folks coming forward saying it's about time, but there are some issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4072.782s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Counsel Lungo-Koehn is correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4074.583s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't have any report in front of you that talks about dates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4077.628s">[Robert Penta]</a>: places, people that you met with, whoever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4080.33s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if some of the landowners that were supposed to have met with the city did not want their names mentioned, you could go into an executive session and that would protect it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4089.175s">[Robert Penta]</a>: At least you would have an idea who they were, where the locations might've been.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4093.778s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There wasn't one police union representative committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4098.381s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So what does that tell you there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4099.822s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where was their involvement on this particular location for whatever it might be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4105.08s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The other part about it is the city council, you folks had no involvement at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4108.463s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're hearing about it for the first time last week and at 10 o'clock last week, you get a phone call or an email saying there's a press announcement the next day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4116.349s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's great for transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4118.35s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This administration was going to be so transparent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4121.353s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's about as transparent as this rug on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4124.996s">[Robert Penta]</a>: More importantly, going forward, the fire chief not being involved, not even being consulted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4130.82s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I can't answer for the chief of police because I did speak with him last Tuesday night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4134.767s">[Robert Penta]</a>: at the council meeting and there was going to be an announcement the next day, whether he knew what the announcement was or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4140.949s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4141.789s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We didn't get to the finality of it, but if the fire department, like I have a particular purpose to this thing, then it should be brought into play.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4151.052s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now let's talk about the bonding, because if you get into the Dun and Sweeney report, which is dated January, 2013.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4157.767s">[Robert Penta]</a>: as Councilor Marks has alluded to, there is a funding mechanism here that needs to be addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4162.369s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the funding mechanism that needs to be addressed is that if you leave that fire department alone, the way it is right now, and just go with a police department, you have a bonding situation for which this city council is going to be paying for whatever the rate's going to be to bond the police station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4177.795s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But over the next 20 years in the life of the bond, that Medford Fire Department and its headquarters are not going to be up to code.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4184.138s">[Robert Penta]</a>: mechanically, electrically, and whatever else is needed by the standards as we go further in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4189.9s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So to take into consideration the possibility of having a police and a fire department put together or mixing the two together, how these two buildings can merge themselves together, how you can add or subtract to it, that should be the discussion before you say the final, the police department, that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4208.21s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Isn't it best to sit down and discuss these things rather than she made the decision?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4213.581s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Who is she to make the decision with the taxpayer's money and that she puts you guys in a corner and girls in a corner?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4220.421s">[Robert Penta]</a>: boxing you in, like a rubber stamp.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4222.543s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you don't vote for it, that means you're against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4224.384s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4225.845s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What's true is you should be a part of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4228.027s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're all part of this, whether we're a taxpaying citizen, an elected official, the mayor, whoever we're be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4235.133s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But more importantly, you have fire and police out here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4238.276s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And to some degree, they are divided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4240.037s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because you know something?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4241.178s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The fire department is starting to realize things that they need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4244.241s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Just because there's a $2,500,000 inclusion in the capital<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4248.524s">[Robert Penta]</a>: program, what does that say?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4250.247s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where is that going?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4251.329s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How does that affect them on their side of the building?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4254.615s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You just gave over $300,000 a few weeks ago for their turnout gear, but they've only got one set of washing machines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4262.243s">[Robert Penta]</a>: 6, 3, and 2, if I understand those bond houses, 6, 3, and 2 would like to have washing machines that are very expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4270.489s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, why wasn't that brought up as a subject matter?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4273.491s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is that going to be something that's going to be a challenge?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4276.092s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, I would hope not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4277.553s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You pay for one thing, but you don't pay for another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4280.575s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Another thing is there is absolutely no detailed analysis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4285.488s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The city treasurer is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4286.909s">[Robert Penta]</a>: She has not presented, neither has the mayor presented you a detailed analysis of bonds that are going to be terminating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4293.772s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And by those bonds terminating, the city can just transfer themselves over to paying the same amount that those bonds were paying that would pay for this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4303.077s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I want to see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4304.558s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As a taxpayer and as an elected official, you need to see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4308.9s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because is the city saying your taxes won't go up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4313.462s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Your rates won't go up because of this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4316.207s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And where is all the grants from the federal government and the state?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4320.831s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The city of Malden got $9 million in grants before they started their project to build an $18 million building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4327.016s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where is the one grant from the federal government or the Commonwealth of Massachusetts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4330.959s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Has anyone received one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4332.381s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Have you become aware of it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4334.282s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't even know if they've even applied for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4336.723s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It would have nice to know that if you had a sense of conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4340.285s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you, Mr. President, being the leader of this body, had the mayor invited you in at least at minimum to have a conversation about this, you could at least bring some information back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4350.072s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But she shut you out too, which is wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4353.435s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can't do it by yourself, your own way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4357.497s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, you get elected to do a job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4361.982s">[Robert Penta]</a>: transparent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4362.783s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You talk about being independent voices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4365.424s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How can you be an independent voice if you shut out, if you're not part of the situation, you're not part of the process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4372.49s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, we spent dollars for a Denham and Sweeney's report in January of 2013 that was presented to the council in 2014.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4382.056s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You had a committee of the whole meeting where there were a lot of issues that were brought up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4385.479s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I don't think any one fireman or any one policewoman<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4389.539s">[Robert Penta]</a>: police man or lady, excuse me, or a fire lady and a fireman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4393.2s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't think they want to see any division between and amongst themselves, because I certainly don't want it, and I don't think the city needs it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4399.082s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But this is crunch time right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4401.043s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're talking about a subject matter that's now involving both fire and police.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4406.565s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And unless the city administration says that the fire department is not going to be involved in this, this is just a police issue, a police building issue, and a police department issue, then I think you have a problem, because the problem is now presenting itself before you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4421.075s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The report talks about a merger of the buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4424.157s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It talks about the irregular space that you have over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4426.999s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It also talks about having a minimum of three and a half acres to have a modern, up-to-date fire and police department that can take you into the next generation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4435.712s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're only dealing with more than two and a half acres of land.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4438.633s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So your space requirements are already confirmed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4441.434s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And to build a three and a half story building, who made that determination?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4445.036s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where's the parking facility going to go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4447.097s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you're going to have a schematic design, you talk about something that's going to take place over the next six to eight months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4452.659s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Six to eight months are going to prove to be what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4454.339s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're going to go out there for a design.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4455.62s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But to get to the six to eight months, you guys have to make a decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4458.641s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're going to have to agree and disagree on things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4460.582s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you're going to have to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4461.742s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you're going to have to have people input, your input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4466.296s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Taxpayers' input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4467.677s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's their money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4469.478s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's the taxpayers' money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4471.158s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I can guarantee that every single police officer and every single fireperson can come up to this podium and say that they need what they need to do their job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4480.243s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They should not be denied, but they should have the option of knowing that every conceivable option was presented and discussed and voted upon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4488.627s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It wasn't squirreled into a particular corner, a particular group, on a particular day, and then we'll talk about the next issue on another day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4496.432s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The stupidest way to waste money is to spend it recklessly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4500.614s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And right now, I think you would be doing that before you sit down and take into consideration all the needs that are out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4507.256s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why would the capital improvement program have a $2.5 million inclusion in the fire department?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4513.05s">[Robert Penta]</a>: without you folks knowing about it, but you're dealing with a $2 million requirement to go out there and have a schematic design, and then a $20 million to build a building, and how do you know if that building, in effect, is gonna have any effect at all on the fire department, or vice versa?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4526.914s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4528.495s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, we live in a great city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4530.355s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have a great group of people in here, and we all wanna do the right thing, the best thing for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4535.637s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But we need to be smart, and we need to be inclusive, and we need to be,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4540.197s">[Robert Penta]</a>: understanding that we all can't think the same way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4543.199s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if you can't think the same way without having an opportunity to talk about it, you'll never be able to accomplish anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4550.062s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Today is Valentine's Day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4551.943s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I wish you all a happy Valentine's Day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4554.524s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But with the white Christmas lights outside, I'm a little bit confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4558.026s">[Robert Penta]</a>: OK?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4561.407s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4562.248s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6167.472s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Councilor Knight just hit it right in the head.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6169.807s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have questions to be asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6171.008s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've waited some 15, 20 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6172.609s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The chief says it's been some 20 years looking for a new police station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6175.971s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not going to happen overnight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6177.072s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're going to have to take six to eight months before you even get the groundwork going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6181.315s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let me make an offering here that maybe you folks through the presidency, go to the mayor tomorrow morning, because I saw her walking out of the building tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6190.041s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Apparently she decided not to come to the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6192.382s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is her baby.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6193.363s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is not your baby.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6194.584s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's her baby.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6195.204s">[Robert Penta]</a>: She's the one that made the presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6197.306s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You tell her that you want to sit down and talk with her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6200.165s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have all the questions you want to ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6201.906s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It would be nice, maybe the first time in somewhat 16 months, that you had an opportunity of all of you to sit down, break some bread in our office, and just saying, hey, these are the questions we're going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6212.735s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let's do this all together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6214.436s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And maybe you can come to some sense of resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6216.959s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't think a week or two is going to make any difference right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6219.12s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't think the first reading is going to make any difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6221.702s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because the fact of the matter is you don't have your questions answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6224.505s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And until those questions are answered, you won't be able to go anywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6228.212s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, Councilor Falco, you had a concern over the tower, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6232.74s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, you don't have that answer yet, but we can get into all the minutiae of the questions that need to be asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6238.369s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So why don't you just reverse it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6240.353s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Call her up tomorrow morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6243.298s">[Robert Penta]</a>: 8.30 when she comes to work, like everybody else at City Hall, 8.30 in the morning, go knocking on her door and just saying, we're having a meeting with you, Madam Mayor and the City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6252.324s">[Robert Penta]</a>: She needs you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6253.405s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't need her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6254.305s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Remember that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6255.466s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're her breadstrings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6256.947s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're her lifeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6258.768s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you don't hold her feet to the fire, she'll just use you each and every time she wants something done for her, to make her look politically good, and to embarrass you folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6268.25s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And right now, that's the position you're in, an embarrassing position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6271.65s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you don't need to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6273.311s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now's the time to turn around, put your big boy suits on, and your shoes, and your girl, and your high heels, and go knock on that door and say, we're here to do business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6280.772s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you want to do business, we're ready to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6283.173s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If not, we're shutting down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6284.813s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what I would do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2324.719s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2326.06s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2327.181s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Penter, former member of the Zargas Party, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2333.064s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'd like to go over some points that were brought up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2334.645s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Unfortunately, the whole meeting wasn't televised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2337.907s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But it was probably a misreading on your part, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2341.553s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not a 3,500 square foot building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2343.794s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a 35,000 square foot building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2346.536s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2347.297s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Number two, in the report, it states it's going to be three stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2351.799s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And our good friend, the city solicitor has been quoted by saying that the mayor said she has decided where the building is going to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2358.823s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The sad part about this whole commentary is the mayor is proposing an excess of a 22 and a half million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2365.788s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And we don't even know what the contingencies might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2368.629s">[Robert Penta]</a>: proposal here for the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2370.33s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This present city council, this will be the largest financial bonding that you folks are going to be doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2376.013s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And because of that, and because of that, I agree with Councilor Marks, the mayor should be here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2380.275s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is her proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2382.076s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because when she announced when she was campaigning, it would be seven to eight years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2386.178s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How it got sped up to this point, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2388.52s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But thankfully because of the police department going out there and having their demonstrations and speaking up<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2395.753s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and folks coming forward saying it's about time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2398.815s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But there are some issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2399.795s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Councilor Lungo-Koehn is correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2401.596s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't have any report in front of you that talks about dates, places, people that you met with, whoever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2407.359s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if some of the landowners that were supposed to have met with the city did not want their names mentioned, you could go into an executive session and that would protect it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2416.204s">[Robert Penta]</a>: At least you would have an idea who they were, where the locations might have been.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2420.806s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There wasn't one police union representative on this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2425.4s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So what does that tell you there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2426.841s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where was their involvement on this particular location for whatever it might be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2432.083s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The other part about it is the city council, you folks had no involvement at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2435.484s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're hearing about it for the first time last week and at 10 o'clock last week, you get a phone call or an email saying there's a press announcement the next day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2443.368s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's great for transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2445.369s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This administration was going to be so transparent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2448.37s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's about as transparent as this rug on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2451.995s">[Robert Penta]</a>: More importantly, going forward, the fire chief not being involved, not even being consulted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2457.818s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I can't answer for the chief of police, because I did speak with him last Tuesday night at the council meeting, and there was going to be an announcement the next day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2465.381s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Whether he knew what the announcement was or not, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2468.803s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We didn't get to the finality of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2470.584s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if the fire department, like they are here tonight, have a particular purpose to this thing, then it should be brought into play.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2478.067s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now let's talk about the bonding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2479.92s">[Robert Penta]</a>: because if you get into the Dun and Sweeney report, which is dated January of 2013,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2484.783s">[Robert Penta]</a>: as Councilor Marks has alluded to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2486.824s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There is a funding mechanism here that needs to be addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2489.384s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the funding mechanism that needs to be addressed is that if you leave that fire department alone, the way it is right now, and just go with a police department, you have a bonding situation for which this city council is going to be paying for whatever the rate's gonna be to bond the police station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2504.809s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But over the next 20 years in the life of the bond, that Medford Fire Department and its headquarters are not going to be up to code.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2511.151s">[Robert Penta]</a>: mechanically, electrically, and whatever else is needed by the standards as we go further in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2516.934s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So to take into consideration the possibility of having a police and a fire department put together, or mixing the two together, how these two buildings can merge themselves together, how you can add or subtract to it, that should be the discussion before you say the final, the police department, that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2535.244s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Isn't it best to sit down and discuss these things?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2538.347s">[Robert Penta]</a>: rather than she made the decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2540.59s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Who is she to make the decision with the taxpayer's money and then she puts you guys in a corner and girls in a corner, boxing you in like a rubber stamp.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2549.561s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you don't vote for it, that means you're against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2551.423s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2552.885s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What's true is you should be a part of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2555.068s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're all part of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2556.91s">[Robert Penta]</a>: whether we're a taxpaying citizen, an elected official, the mayor, whoever we're being.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2562.153s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But more importantly, you have fire and police out here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2565.274s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And to some degree, they are divided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2567.035s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because you know something?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2568.176s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The fire department is starting to realize things that they need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2571.237s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Just because there's a $2,500,000 inclusion in the capital improvement program, what does that say?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2577.28s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where is that going?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2578.341s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How does that affect them on their side of the building?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2581.625s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You just gave over $300,000 a few weeks ago for their turnout gear, but they've only got one set of washing machines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2589.27s">[Robert Penta]</a>: 6, 3, and 2, if I understand those bond houses, 6, 3, and 2 would like to have washing machines that are very expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2597.516s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, why wasn't that brought up as a subject matter?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2600.518s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is that gonna be something that's gonna be a challenge?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2603.119s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, I would hope not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2604.6s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You pay for one thing, but you don't pay for another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2607.662s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Another thing is there is absolutely no detailed analysis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2612.568s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The city treasurer is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2613.988s">[Robert Penta]</a>: She has not presented, neither has the mayor presented you a detailed analysis of bonds that are going to be terminating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2620.85s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And by those bonds terminating, the city can just transfer themselves over to paying the same amount that those bonds were paying that would pay for this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2630.152s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I want to see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2631.572s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As a taxpayer and as an elected official, you need to see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2635.913s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because is the city saying your taxes won't go up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2640.475s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Your rates won't go up because of this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2643.219s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And where is all the grants from the federal government and the state?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2647.843s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The city of Malden got $9 million in grants before they started their project to build an $18 million building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2654.029s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where is the one grant from the federal government or the Commonwealth of Massachusetts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2657.952s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Has anyone received one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2659.393s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Have you become aware of it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2661.275s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't even know if they've even applied for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2663.736s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It would have nice to know that if you had a sense of conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2667.3s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you, Mr. President, being the leader of this body, had the mayor invited you in at least at minimum to have a conversation about this, you could at least bring some information back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2677.09s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But she shut you out too, which is wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2680.433s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can't do it by yourself, your own way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2684.518s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2685.839s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You get elected to do a job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2687.841s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You talk about being transparent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2689.802s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You talk about being independent voices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2692.425s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How can you be an independent voice if you shut out, if you're not part of the situation, you're not part of the process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2699.49s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, we spent $110,000 for a Denham and Sweeney's report in January of 2013 that was presented to the council in 2014.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2709.045s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You had a Committee of the Whole meeting where there were a lot of issues that were brought up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2712.467s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I don't think any one fireman or any one police woman or lady, police man or lady, excuse me, or a fire lady and a fireman, I don't think they want to see any division between and amongst themselves, because I certainly don't want it, and I don't think the city needs it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2726.095s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But this is crunch time right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2728.057s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're talking about a subject matter that's now involving both fire and police.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2733.58s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And unless the city administration says that the fire department is not going to be involved in this, this is just a police issue, a police building issue, and a police department issue, then I think you have a problem, because the problem is now presenting itself before you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2748.071s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The report talks about a merger of the buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2751.153s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It talks about the irregular space that you have over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2753.995s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It also talks about having a minimum of three and a half acres to have a modern, up-to-date fire and police department that can take you into the next generation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2762.725s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're only dealing with more than two and a half acres of land.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2765.626s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So your space requirements are already confined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2768.447s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And to build a three and a half story building, who made that determination?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2772.028s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where's the parking facility going to go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2774.109s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you're going to have a schematic design?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2776.37s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You talk about something that's going to take place over the next six to eight months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2779.671s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Six to eight months are going to prove to be what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2781.331s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're going to go out there for a design.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2782.612s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But to get to the six to eight months, you guys have to make a decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2785.633s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're going to have to agree and disagree on things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2787.593s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you're going to have to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2788.734s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you're going to have to have people input, your input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2793.322s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Taxpayers' input, it's their money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2796.523s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's the taxpayers' money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2798.183s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I can guarantee that every single police officer and every single fireperson can come up to this podium and say that they need what they need to do their job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2807.266s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They should not be denied, but they should have the option of knowing that every conceivable option was presented and discussed and voted upon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2815.669s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It wasn't squirreled into a particular corner, a particular group, on a particular day, and then we'll talk about the next issue on another day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2823.458s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The stupidest way to waste money is to spend it recklessly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2827.663s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And right now, I think you would be doing that before you sit down and take into consideration all the needs that are out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2834.311s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why would the capital improvement program have a $2.5 million inclusion for the fire department?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2840.078s">[Robert Penta]</a>: without you folks knowing about it, but you're dealing with a $2 million requirement to go out there and have a schematic design, and then a $20 million to build a building, and how do you know if that building, in effect, is gonna have any effect at all on the fire department, or vice versa?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2853.964s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2855.524s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, we live in a great city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2857.405s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have a great group of people in here, and we all wanna do the right thing, the best thing for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2862.687s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But we need to be smart, and we need to be inclusive, and we need to be,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2867.243s">[Robert Penta]</a>: understanding that we all can't think the same way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2870.226s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if you can't think the same way without having an opportunity to talk about it, you'll never be able to accomplish anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2877.093s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Today is Valentine's Day, and I wish you all a happy Valentine's Day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2881.577s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But with the white Christmas lights outside, I'm a little bit confused, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2888.443s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2889.304s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4486.192s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Name and address for the record please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4487.392s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Bedford, Mass, former member of this board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4490.853s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, this is the problem that's happening here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4494.414s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Councilor Knight just hit it right in the head.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4496.752s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have questions to be asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4497.953s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've waited some 15, 20 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4499.554s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The chief says it's been some 20 years looking for a new police station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4502.917s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not gonna happen overnight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4504.038s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're gonna have to take six to eight months before you even get the groundwork going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4508.261s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let me make an offering here that maybe you folks through the presidency, go to the mayor tomorrow morning, because I saw her walking out of the building tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4516.988s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Apparently she decided not to come to the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4519.33s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is her baby.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4520.31s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is not your baby, it's her baby.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4522.152s">[Robert Penta]</a>: She's the one that made the presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4524.273s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You tell her that you wanna sit down and talk with her,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4527.107s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have all the questions you wanna ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4528.848s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It would be nice, maybe the first time in some, what, 16 months, that you had an opportunity for all of you to sit down, break some bread in our office, and just saying, hey, these are the questions we're going, let's do this all together, and maybe you can come to some sense of resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4543.892s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't think a week or two is gonna make any difference right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4546.273s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't think a first reading is gonna make any difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4548.633s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because the fact of the matter is, you don't have your questions answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4551.434s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And until those questions are answered, you're not gonna be able to go anywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4555.153s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, Councilor Falco, you had a concern over the tower, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4559.696s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, you don't have that answer yet, but we can get into all the minutia of the questions that need to be asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4565.301s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So why don't you just reverse it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4567.282s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Call her up tomorrow morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4570.246s">[Robert Penta]</a>: 8.30 when she comes to work, like everybody else at City Hall, 8.30 in the morning, go knocking on her door and just saying, we're having a meeting with you, Madam Mayor and the City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4579.27s">[Robert Penta]</a>: She needs you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4580.351s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't need her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4581.251s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Remember that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4582.412s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're her breadstrings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4583.892s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're her lifeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4585.713s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you don't hold her feet to the fire, she'll just use you each and every time she wants something done for her, to make her look politically good, and to embarrass you folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4595.221s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And right now, that's the position you're in, an embarrassing position, but you don't need to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4600.266s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now's the time to turn around, put your big boy suits on, and your shoes, and your girl, and your high heels, and go knock on that door, and say, we're here to do business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4607.732s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you wanna do business, we're ready to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4610.135s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If not, we're shutting down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4611.796s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what I would do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2619.989s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of the Saugus party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2625.471s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't have any problems with the requests that are being made, but my problem is in the process that's being presented here to you this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2632.554s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Um, what seems to be unfamiliar is the fact that this president administration talked about this issue<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2639.088s">[Robert Penta]</a>: of inclusion and being a part of what's taking place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2642.53s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have the police, the forestry, the engineering department, the cemetery, the highway, and the fire department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2648.235s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Six departments that you folks during budgetary time have heard all of these concerns that are being presented here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2655.68s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as a matter of fact, it goes back to the times when I served in this body where some of these issues were there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2660.903s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This money is coming out of free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2663.085s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And because it's coming out of free cash, which was asked for before,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2666.52s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You folks were told, or we were told, as well as you folks were told, at some point in time, we can't use it because it might have an effect upon the bond rating here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2674.925s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, all of a sudden, it's coming out as a $1,100,000 transfer of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2680.809s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And tomorrow night, Madam Mayor is going to be making her presentation for the State of the City's address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2687.973s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My concern would be, if there are more things that are going to be coming that's going to have a cost impact upon not only free cash or maybe even bonding,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2696.524s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think before this vote takes place, I think it probably should be laid on the table for one week, as Councilor Lungo-Koehn rightly did some weeks ago on the request of the $900,000 to have some transfer of money from the Water and Sewer account to pay for the remediation of the West Method parking lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2714.09s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, you folks have your own rules, and it's rule number 20, section number 4, which states that any finance paper appearing on the council agenda for the first time shall be automatically laid on the table for one week<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2726.916s">[Robert Penta]</a>: when such action is requested by any Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2730.058s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would think it would be wise by this city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2732.48s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm not saying for you to not vote for it or vote for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2734.702s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it would be wise to lay it on the table for a week and just see what's going to be presented tomorrow night in the state of the city's address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2742.007s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You folks unfortunately have been kept in the loop, not in the loop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2746.05s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Everything that's being presented here has nothing to do with you folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2749.472s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You folks have never met with all the department heads to go through their wishlist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2753.933s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That was something that was discussed during this past election, and it still hasn't taken place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2758.854s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A magnificence of $1 million here tonight, and the mayor's representative is not here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2764.856s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That doesn't speak well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2766.916s">[Robert Penta]</a>: One information, Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2771.697s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The mayor's liaison to the city council is not here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2774.598s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Department heads might be here, but they're not the ones that bring the message back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2778.299s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, when you go back and you look at some of these things, and you say to yourself, the chief of police just thought through saying,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2783.507s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Six cruises, six regular cars and six cars that are going to be unmarked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2789.618s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think this council in the past has asked for each and every year, chief, you can correct me, for a minimum of two new cars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2795.3s">[Robert Penta]</a>: each and every year in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2797.042s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This should have been, you folks should have been dealing with this within the past year, if not more, and you're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2802.528s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2803.148s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My opinion, and it's election year, and you're getting all this confronted in front of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2807.093s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're gonna be getting sidewalks, you're gonna be getting streets, all done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2810.917s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But where was this money not being used during this past year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2814.618s">[Robert Penta]</a>: during a year which people had to suffer to go through this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2817.761s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why should the fire department have to wait on their turnaround year that they were promised not only last year but the year before?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2824.247s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And now all of a sudden it's found in a free cash supplement when it could have been at the same time taken out of free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2830.713s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It could have been taken out as of January 1st with the new administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2834.856s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The politics behind this is quite obvious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2837.399s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But even more to the politics of it is tomorrow night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2840.795s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My suggestion would be to wait till tomorrow night, see what this address is all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2844.838s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if the address has inclusions of other transfers of money or monies that have to go out for the purposes of being bonded, I think you really need to have a discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2854.445s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you, Mr. President, you know, amongst this council, there's $210,000 a year paid in salaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2860.988s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The executive office, the mayor only gets paid $140,000 a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2865.31s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So there's more power strength here by what you are getting paid than what that corner office is getting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2871.513s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you should put that to use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2873.234s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if four of you get together and saying, hey, before we start expending these monies, just right off the hat, Councilman Marks, you've asked for two years in a row for a truck division within the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2884.079s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Nowhere is that found here, and nowhere is it found in the capital improvement plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2888.881s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Think about it, in today's day and age, you're talking about email now being in the fire department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2894.485s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't even know if they have email in the police department, but if the fire department is now getting email, and they're supposed to be technologically up to snuff here, we should have the gentleman who runs your computer system down here, and he should be questioned as to what are the problems, and what is the technology needed within this city of Medford, whether it be the fire department, school department, or the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2915.545s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You haven't had that conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2917.666s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's a wishlist that goes out every single year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2919.908s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The wishlist is never even addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2922.109s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You just got through, Mr. President, talking about the scanners or the OCD, I mean, excuse me, the engineering office asked for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2928.232s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a simple little request that could have come right out of free cash last year, two years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2933.295s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As a matter of fact, when the lady was there and she made her presentation before the council, she showed you emails that were sent, emails that were sent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2942.39s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that the administration wouldn't do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2944.611s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So what's being obvious is the fact that you're being asked to do something tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2949.194s">[Robert Penta]</a>: To me, it looks like you're being squirreled into a corner that if you don't vote for it, you're bad and you're not doing what you've all been asking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2956.097s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's not what I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2957.378s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What I'm saying is you have one more night to wait and see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2960.499s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't see this as being such an emergency that it needs to be voted on tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2964.682s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Your own council rule says the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2967.463s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Lay it on the table for one week, and if it comes out to be the same when you want to vote for it, go right ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2972.528s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But tomorrow night, if the State of the Union address is going to have something that has another financial impact within this community, whether it's coming off of your free cash or a bond or whatever it might be, don't you think you owe it to yourselves as legislative representatives and to the people of this community to wait and see?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2991.765s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've waited all this time<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2994.202s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Pieces have been taken out of a capital improvement program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=2997.664s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All of a sudden, things that you've been asking for just coincidentally happens to be in your agenda tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3003.466s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, I don't think that's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3004.807s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think all seven of you should have been brought in to fold, whether you agree with the mayor or you don't agree with the mayor, whether she agrees with you or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3012.171s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is an important issue, many important issues here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3015.313s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This isn't $10,000 or $15,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3017.715s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is a million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3019.036s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the remaining balance of $8,600,000 is still there to be played with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3024.82s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you have no idea what she's going to do with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3027.322s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's up to you folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3028.763s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you folks can't put the mayor together and force that lady to sit down and talk with you, to turn around and say, hey, you may be picking out things that you need, but that's not what this council sees and hears from Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3042.228s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I just respectfully state to you, follow your own council rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3045.709s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Hopefully one of you will lay it on the table for one week, see what comes out tomorrow night, and recognize the fact that whatever your issues might be, they're addressed before this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3055.272s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, you have a capital improvement program here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3057.452s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's a lot of things in this capital improvement program that also relates back to the fire department, the police department, some of them are in the school department, and what have you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3064.554s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It would be nice to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3067.153s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Whether a new police department is going to end the offering for tomorrow night, there's $2 million in there to figure out where they're going to put it, draw it, and all of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3074.938s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you have sat down and talked with her or her people, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3078.1s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think you should.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3079.521s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's the most pressing issue, the biggest, most pressing issue here financially for the city of Medford, and no discussion on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3086.406s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you're getting over $1 million worth of transfers being asked for tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3090.548s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Again, I repeat, I am not against any of these transfers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3093.39s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What I'm against is the process, how it's being presented,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3096.279s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and the opportunity you have to make sure that before you vote for this, you see the complete and total picture, which I believe will be presented tomorrow evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Td1aKbafo1U&t=3103.605s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2552.378s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of the Saugus party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2557.86s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't have any problems with the requests that are being made, but my problem is in the process that's being presented here to you this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2565.735s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What seems to be unfamiliar is the fact that this present administration talked about this issue of inclusion and being a part of what's taking place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2574.917s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have the police, the forestry, the engineering department, the cemetery, the highway, and the fire department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2580.618s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Six departments that you folks, during budgetary time, have heard all of these concerns that are being presented here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2588.06s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as a matter of fact, it goes back to the times when I served in this body where some of these issues were there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2593.283s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This money is coming out of free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2595.445s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And because it's coming out of free cash, which was asked for before, you folks were told, or we were told, as well as you folks were told, at some point in time, we can't use it because it might have an effect upon the bond rating here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2607.315s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, all of a sudden, it's coming out as a $1,100,000 transfer of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2613.2s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And tomorrow night, Madam Mayor is going to be making her presentation for the State of the City's Address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2620.357s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My concern would be if there are more things that are going to be coming that's going to have a cost impact upon not only free cash or maybe even bonding, I think before this vote takes place, I think it probably should be laid on the table for one week, as Councilor Lungo-Koehn rightly did some weeks ago on the request of the $900,000 to have some transfer of money from the Water and Sewer Account to pay for the remediation of the West Medford parking lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2646.471s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, you folks have your own rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2648.805s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and it's rule number 20, section number four, which states that any finance paper appearing on the council agenda for the first time shall be automatically laid on the table for one week when such action is requested by any councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2662.451s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would think it would be wise by this city council, I'm not saying for you to not vote for it or vote for it, I think it would be wise to lay it on the table for a week and just see what's going to be presented tomorrow night in the state of the city's address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2674.396s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You folks, unfortunately, have been kept not in the loop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2678.427s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Everything that's being presented here has nothing to do with you folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2681.829s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You folks have never met with all the department heads to go through their wish lists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2686.332s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That was something that was discussed during this past election, and it still hasn't taken place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2691.235s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A magnificence of $1 million here tonight, and the mayor's representative is not here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2697.239s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That doesn't speak well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2699.32s">[Robert Penta]</a>: One information council tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2700.501s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe the mayor has four representatives here this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2703.372s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The mayor's liaison to the City Council is not here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2706.974s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Department heads might be here, but they're not the ones that bring the message back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2710.675s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, when you go back and you look at some of these things and you say to yourself, the chief of police just thought through saying six cruises, six new, six regular cars and six cars that are going to be unmarked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2722.001s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think this council in the past has asked for each and every year,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2725.046s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Chief, you can correct me, for a minimum of two new cars each and every year in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2729.427s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This should have been, you folks should have been dealing with this within the past year, if not more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2733.948s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2734.908s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2735.528s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My opinion, and it's election year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2737.308s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you're getting all this confronted in front of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2739.469s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're gonna be getting sidewalks, you're gonna be getting streets, all done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2743.269s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But where was this money not being used during this past year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2746.99s">[Robert Penta]</a>: During a year which people had to suffer to go through this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2750.131s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why should the fire department have to wait?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2752.663s">[Robert Penta]</a>: on their turnaround gear that they were promised not only last year but the year before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2756.628s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And now all of a sudden it's found in a free cash supplement when it could have been at the same time taken out of free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2763.075s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It could have been taken out as of January 1st with the new administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2767.24s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The politics behind this is quite obvious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2769.783s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But even more to the politics of it is tomorrow night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2773.157s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My suggestion would be to wait until tomorrow night, see what this address is all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2777.222s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if the address has inclusions of other transfers of money or monies that have to go out for the purposes of being bonded, I think you really need to have a discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2786.833s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you, Mr. President, you know, amongst this council, there's $210,000 a year paid in salaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2793.367s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The executive office, the mayor only gets paid $140,000 a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2797.67s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So there's more power strength here by what you are getting paid than what that corner office is getting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2803.874s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you should put that to use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2805.615s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if four of you get together and saying, hey, before we start expending these monies, just right off the hat, Councilor Marks, you've asked for two years in a row for a truck division within the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2816.443s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Nowhere is that found here, and nowhere is it found in the capital improvement plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2821.246s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Think about it, in today's day and age, you're talking about email now being in the fire department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2826.85s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't even know if they have email in the police department, but if the fire department is now getting email, and they're supposed to be technologically up to snuff here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2835.096s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We should have the gentleman who runs your computer system down here, and he should be questioned as to what are the problems, and what is the technology needed within this city of Medford, whether it be the fire department, school department, or the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2847.91s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You haven't had that conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2850.031s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's a wishlist that goes out every single year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2852.273s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The wishlist is never even addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2854.474s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You just got through, Mr. President, talking about the scanner to the OCD, I mean, excuse me, the engineering office asked for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2860.597s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a simple little request that could have come right out of free cash last year, two years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2865.66s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As a matter of fact, when the lady was there and she made her presentation before the council, she showed you emails that were sent, emails that were sent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2874.755s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that the administration wouldn't do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2876.976s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So what's being obvious is the fact that you're being asked to do something tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2881.558s">[Robert Penta]</a>: To me, it looks like you're being squirreled into a corner, that if you don't vote for it, you're bad, and you're not doing what you've all been asking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2888.462s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's not what I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2889.742s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What I'm saying is you have one more night to wait and see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2892.864s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't see this as being such an emergency that it needs to be voted on tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2897.046s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Your own council rule says the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2899.847s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Lay it on the table for one week, and if it comes out to be the same when you want to vote for it, go right ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2904.9s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But tomorrow night, if the State of the Union address is going to have something that has another financial impact within this community, whether it's coming off of your free cash or a bond or whatever it might be, don't you think you owe it to yourselves as legislative representatives and to the people of this community to wait and see?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2924.125s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've waited all this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2926.567s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Pieces have been taken out of a capital improvement program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2930.029s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All of a sudden, things that you've been asking for just coincidentally happens to be in your agenda tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2935.833s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, I don't think that's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2937.174s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think all seven of you should have been brought in to fold, whether you agree with the mayor or you don't agree with the mayor, whether she agrees with you or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2944.536s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is an important issue, many important issues here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2947.678s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This isn't $10,000 or $15,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2950.08s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is a million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2951.4s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the remaining balance of $8,600,000 is still there to be played with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2959.686s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's up to you folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2961.127s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you folks can't put the mayor together and force that lady to sit down and talk with you, to turn around and say, hey, you may be picking out things that you need, but that's not what this council sees and hears from Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2974.593s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I just respectfully state to you, follow your own council rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2978.075s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Hopefully one of you will lay it on the table for one week, see what comes out tomorrow night, and recognize the fact that whatever your issues might be, they're addressed before this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2987.641s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, you have a capital improvement program here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2989.822s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's a lot of things in this capital improvement program that also relates back to the fire department, the police department, some of them are in the school department, and what have you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2996.927s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It would be nice to know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2999.538s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Whether a new police department is going to end the offering for tomorrow night, there's $2 million in there to figure out where they're going to put it, draw it, and all of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3007.302s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you have sat down and talked with her or her people, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3010.503s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think you should.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3011.924s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's the most pressing issue, the biggest, most pressing issue here financially for the city of Medford, and no discussion on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3018.808s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you're getting over $1 million worth of transfers being asked for tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3022.95s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Again, I repeat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3024.04s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I am not against any of these transfers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3025.781s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What I'm against is the process, how it's being presented, and the opportunity you have to make sure that before you vote for this, you see the complete and total picture, which I believe will be presented tomorrow evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3036.025s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l57EqMhB2JU&t=11717.491s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I offer that out as a compromise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l57EqMhB2JU&t=11719.213s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it would work, and I think it would be beneficial, not only to all you folks, but to the community as a whole, because you're now putting everybody on notice that if you are going to take in campus students or off-college students off-campus,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4416.737s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Uh, there might be a compromise to this situation that's being presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4420.24s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I know the committee did some hard work and I know this has been a subject matter of concern when I was serving on the council, but maybe rather than having the idea of submitting a document to the city clerk, um, I think you need to look at this at two points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4435.111s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Number one, what the university does on its own land,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4438.905s">[Robert Penta]</a>: with its own campus provisos for the students, it's no interest of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4443.927s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But what they do off-campus by having off-campus locations for people to provide those locations is a concern to the city, and I believe the concern to the city should be placed on the homeowner or the landowner of where these students might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4458.674s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Councilor Marks alluded to the idea of a violation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4461.555s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If in fact you get a document that gives you these locations of where these students are, I think it's incumbent<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4467.805s">[Robert Penta]</a>: for the purposes of enforcement and having your teeth on the landowner who's collecting the rent from that student to have that student who's going to Tufts University be one of the students that's sitting in an off-campus position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4481.511s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think that could bring you to the compromise of saying, rather than having your code enforcement officer go out, it's upon the landowner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4489.715s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And once that landowner is found in violation, then the city has its own teeth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4522.872s">[Robert Penta]</a>: the safety and the security for that particular person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4525.933s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I offer that out as a compromise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4527.653s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it would work, and I think it would be beneficial not only to all you folks, but to the community as a whole, because you're now putting everybody on notice that if you are going to take in campus students or off-college students off-campus, it's going to be their responsibility to adhere to all the rules and the regulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4544.376s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And any violation would be found right in the teeth of the, excuse me, in the teeth of the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4549.356s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think that's satisfied making the presentation before the clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4552.737s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They make the presentation to the city building department on an annual basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4556.8s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And from there, the city is on notice where these locations might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4560.362s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then it doesn't become a, a matter of public record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4563.264s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It becomes a matter of a public safety issue that the building department has the responsibility for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4569.287s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I offer that out there as a compromise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4981.635s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4983.196s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert Pinto zero summit road metron mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4985.418s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's quite obvious that this is not a new topic before this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4988.571s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When I had served on this council some years back, I mean, this topic when Park Method first came in, had many, many flaws and many, many, how can you say?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=4997.694s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Many things did not make people happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5000.756s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have heard week after week that there are concerns that need to be addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5005.157s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Councilor Lungo-Koehn has just brought up a few.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5007.438s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you also have the ones that basically tell you that common sense needs to take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5014.121s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Two particular instances, a gentleman with a handicapped plate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5018.49s">[Robert Penta]</a>: gets parked in the spot, provided for handicap and gets a ticket.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5023.674s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the argument is you were there more than the two hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5026.796s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now there is nothing in any of these rules that say a handicapped person is relegated to two hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5033.481s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Person goes down to Park Medford, explains the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5036.142s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It doesn't make any difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5037.704s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have to go and do an appeal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5039.945s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5041.006s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Number two, something similar to Councilor Lungo-Koehn alluded to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5044.323s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There was a lady in Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5045.544s">[Robert Penta]</a>: She came with her baby, parked her car.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5048.606s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, in some of these locations, you'll know there may be two or three or even four car lengths apart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5053.849s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So she parked maybe approximately four car lengths ahead of where the meter stand was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5059.592s">[Robert Penta]</a>: She gets out of the car.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5061.614s">[Robert Penta]</a>: She hasn't even got to go get her ticket and come back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5065.476s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the gentleman is there giving her a ticket, OK?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5068.378s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And while she's giving the ticket, she said, I'm just, I had to go get the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5072.584s">[Robert Penta]</a>: had to go pay the meter to park the ticket.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5074.305s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Doesn't make any difference, you don't have a ticket.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5076.286s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, it's the common courtesy of common sense understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5079.709s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think it was you, Councilor Marks, that might have alluded to in the beginning, there should be some sense of maybe of a 15 minute leeway when somebody goes to go and park, by the time they go park their car, go get a ticket and what have you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5091.916s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't see anywhere, anything that even says that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5097.04s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The position that I think you folks have should be the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5099.541s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, the company's been sold,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5102.43s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a new company that's come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5104.772s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think you folks have asked for a copy of the contract and I don't think you've gotten the contract yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5109.756s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's been well over a year and you haven't even gotten a copy of the financials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5113.919s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How many tickets have been issued?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5115.12s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How many tickets have been resolved?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5116.962s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, how much money's coming in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5119.844s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where did the $250,000 in the first year, where did that go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5122.786s">[Robert Penta]</a>: City hasn't even reported back to you on where that might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5126.049s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think Park Method has done quite a bit on this new parking scheme to really hurt<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5132.079s">[Robert Penta]</a>: to hurt the taxpayers and the business people of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5135.541s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We've been told that seniors can park for nothing, but you have to pay $25 to park for nothing to get the permit for once a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5142.726s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you can't transfer it from one car to another, which, again, doesn't help a senior in that particular case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5147.889s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can go down to Haines Square any time in the morning, and you can see just many, many more blank spaces than there have ever been before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5153.453s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Go to Medford Square in the morning, and the same situation happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5157.055s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think the problem here is that Park Medford is just not doing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5160.831s">[Robert Penta]</a>: for the city as what the city thought it would do for its taxpayers and more importantly for its business people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5167.708s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I would suggest when you folks have your Committee of the Whole next meeting, I think it would be more appropriate to have a subsequent meeting here before the council where all the taxpayers can hear and see what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5178.055s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because a lot of people can't come to a Committee of the Whole meeting or a subcommittee meeting for whatever you want to call it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5183.438s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is their public forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5184.519s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is something that has an impact on the entire city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5188.021s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Every single business person and every single person that drives through this community has to be confronted with those stupid kiosks where you're supposed to go and pay, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5197.467s">[Robert Penta]</a>: with situations as Council Member O'Connor had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5200.248s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You had a lady who gave me her ticket, and she had 10 minutes left on her ticket, and she still got a parking violation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5207.31s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And having to go, having to go give up her time, having to take time off from work, which means it could possibly be paid, vacation time, what have you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5215.772s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This isn't right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5216.752s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And with the age of computer technology that we have here right now, if they can't resolve something that simple by going into the Park Medford office that can be resolved, this doesn't make any sense at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5227.896s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it's an insult to the taxpayers and it's an insult to this council who unfortunately has to bear the burden of all these complaints because this is the situation that you're in right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=5238.82s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=758.25s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Penta.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=759.27s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I live at Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., a former member of this august body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=763.712s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In May of 2016, when this issue appeared itself before the council, I came and I spoke and I relayed information for which I will again<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=771.171s">[Robert Penta]</a>: reaffirm with you after speaking with Bond Council for the City of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=775.334s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The City of Medford engages in a tax-exempt IRS status which provides for certain exemptions for the purposes of being excluded from tax for tax particular purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=786.602s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And there is a specific section on 2.2 called government bond status for which the City of Medford has three delineations for which it has a requirement for which it cannot engage in this type of a for-profit private business<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=801.212s">[Robert Penta]</a>: using a municipal piece of property, which would be for profit, even though some of the time would be allotted for the purposes of using the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=809.179s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's very specific in 2.2 of the section of the IRS tax exempt certificate, specifically for the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=815.964s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It clearly states that a non-governmental person will be treated as using proceeds of the bonds and proceeds of each issue of prior obligation of the projects in one of three areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=825.932s">[Robert Penta]</a>: One uses any portion of the projects as owner, lessee,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=829.746s">[Robert Penta]</a>: service provider, operator, or manager, two, acquires the output of the projects, and four, section four, enters into any other arrangement that provided a special legal entitlement or special economic benefit to the non-governmental person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=844.737s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That would happen as what's being presented or potentially could have been presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=848.88s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And accordingly, it says that the city will not enter in any contract or other arrangement after the closing date for the operation or management of any component<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=856.919s">[Robert Penta]</a>: of the project by any party other than a governmental unit in which the governmental unit is the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=863.421s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The city of Medford has a tax certificate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=865.642s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's an 11 page document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=867.443s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It specifically outlines subject matters such as this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=870.924s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Spoke to bond council last year, spoke to office again today, and there happens to be no re-interest in issuing this particular bond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=880.587s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Also, it has to have a legal review as required by the IRS on any exemption or exception.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=887.409s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I don't believe any exception has been offered to you by any legal writing or offering or request for one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=893.713s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I would say at this point in time, uh, thank you for bringing it forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=897.074s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Counsel Lungo and uh, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=899.436s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Method school committee for being so cooperative and transmitting that information back to the council, knowing that it was on the agenda this week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=907.46s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a shame that the communication isn't much better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=910.242s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2291.625s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Name and address of the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2292.606s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert M. Penta, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass, former member of this board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2296.068s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, one of the things that are interesting on the petition that's before the Community Development Board tomorrow night is the fact that the gentleman who was making the petition owns the property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2304.313s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He didn't buy the property on any contingencies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2306.655s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He came in there originally, because I went to the meeting in August, I believe he came in there originally looking for a five-story building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2312.458s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then he's now downsized it to a four-story building, and he secured through the neighborhood another piece of property for which, I don't know if he bought it, it's under a P&S agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2320.279s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the fact of the matter is, it's no more than a three story allowance on that piece of property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2325.624s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The then Medford City Council made that discretion that three stories would be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2329.967s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if we keep breaking these rules, so to speak, without having a public hearing or a discussion as to why it should go from three to four to five, whatever it might be, then you've lost your impact, you've lost your legislative authority and your ability to understand why you need to change zoning and for what particular purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2348.807s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you let this, or if they let this go through tomorrow night, through the Community Development Board, and subsequent to that, to the Zoning Board of Appeals, what you're gonna be doing is you're technically, you're spot zoning the entire city over there, and if you allow one, come in, the past practice has already been established, and it's just gonna keep going on down the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2366.578s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As Cheryl just alluded to, you have the Roberts Junior School over there, the middle school, the elementary school, for kids that are going there, they're already maxed out, the parking is horrendous on any one particular day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2377.88s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Unfortunately for the developer, he probably should've sat down and thought this thing out first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2383.004s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But as it was said, this administration, as I've heard it said myself, is looking for high density because the more they bring in, it's the more money coming in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2391.531s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what you're doing is you're ruining the neighborhoods of the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2396.135s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you just cannot continue to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2398.317s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Locust Street is the perfect example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2400.319s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The council has stepped up to the plate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2402.46s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've gotten your own attorney as well as the neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2405.18s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Don't let these little inconsistencies bog you down by making you feel sorry or bad for the person because he's spending the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2412.782s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If a person is going to be that foolish to spend his money and buy a piece of property not knowing that the zoning is not in hand, then the problem is on his hand, not yours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2422.604s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I really think, Mr. President, this would be the year to have a complete zoning review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2426.825s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it hasn't been.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2427.894s">[Robert Penta]</a>: since the 70s that has taken place, I think now's the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2431.156s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You couldn't have any better of examples, whether it be Locust Street, whether it be here, go on the Fellsway on the corner, I think of the Fellsway, I can't think of the name of the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2440.363s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're building an apartment building where there was a two-family house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2443.445s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It just continues to go on and on and on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2446.007s">[Robert Penta]</a>: City's not meant to be made out of bricks and stones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2449.009s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Medford is meant to be made of people living in a neighborhood that they get along, it's compatible, it reflects the zoning,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2456.855s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it reflects the temperament of the day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2458.737s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It doesn't reflect big business coming in, sucking up the money, and then leaving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2464.103s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You couldn't get a better example of that than Lumineer on Locust Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2467.667s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They build 160 units.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2469.389s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He was there for less than one year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2471.071s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He sold it for $160 million, and he's gone, and he's out of town.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2475.597s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's what we're getting, people coming in, taking advantage of the property, building it up, and then leaving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2481.459s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's not what Medford's all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2482.98s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if that's what this administration wants, well then shame on her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2487.261s">[Robert Penta]</a>: She should understand, and she's lived in this community long enough to know that that should not be the direction of how this city goes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2494.584s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Building is not always better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2496.805s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Better is being smarter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2498.705s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=5090.085s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert Pantaleo, Summit Road, Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=5092.546s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A quick question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=5093.847s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The contract that the city of Medford has with Republic<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=5096.692s">[Robert Penta]</a>: has an inclusion there on an annual basis of $250,000 is supposed to go back to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=5111.575s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think if you read the contract, it says it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=5123.352s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, I would question the fact whether it's annual or not, so we won't dispute that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=5126.974s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The fact of the matter is $250,000 was supposed to come back to cities and towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=5133.697s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But what's it being used for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=5134.877s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It can be used for the lakes, the Council of Lakes is alluding to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=5148.923s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Councilmarks, can it be recommended to Councilmarks, since it's gonna cost us money to save money, that that money come from that particular account, since his resolution, I'm assuming, is a citywide, has a citywide impact?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=5169.818s">[Robert Penta]</a>: For the five business districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=5172.0s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And they have a right to be included in the LED approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=5175.622s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All right, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=6960.496s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They don't have to participate in the conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7009.956s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7010.876s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Penta zero summit road, Medford mass, former member of this August body who did engage in a conversation as it relates to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7019.38s">[Robert Penta]</a>: At that point in time, I was a member of the board of directors of the mass municipal association and I brought the message back to this method city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7026.597s">[Robert Penta]</a>: as it related to the new changing of GIC insurance to cities and towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7031.141s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Quick history.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7031.702s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The reason why I'm here tonight, I was edified by a union representative as it states, as this gentleman stated that on February 1st, there will be a public hearing in Boston as it relates to these new GIC changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7046.975s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And he was, he was encouraging his membership, which includes city of Medford employees to go there and to participate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7054.081s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7054.597s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm speaking in behalf of all City of Medford employees and retirees, as well as myself, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7062.223s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Quick history, back in January 14th of 2015, before this Medford City Council, it was shown and it was presented to you that GIC, for which the City of Medford became a member on January 1st, 2012,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7077.865s">[Robert Penta]</a>: was at a deficit of approximately $160 to $190 million in deficit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7084.63s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that was a result of three prior years of not being funded by the state legislature to meet the needs that GIC needed to have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7093.237s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That presented, at that point in time, a $120 million deficit that was below the, at present then, funding level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7101.383s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that was due to the statewide underfunding, and it was also due to the misprojected increased claims costs<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7107.881s">[Robert Penta]</a>: regarding health care here in Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7111.582s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So what happened at that point in time some two years ago?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7114.623s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Rates increased, deductibles increased, and office visits increased.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7121.486s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When the city of Medford went from bargaining from a PPO to a POS, for cities and towns required union support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7129.408s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the union support came from the city of Medford as well when they signed that contract in August of 2011 by 14 signatories<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7138.212s">[Robert Penta]</a>: of people, representatives here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7141.936s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now we have a GIC proposal that is pending before the legislature and it'll be pending before GIC.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7147.902s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Strike that, it's before GIC, not the legislature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7150.945s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the proposal is going to make a request that a unilateral<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7156.869s">[Robert Penta]</a>: implementation for an additional cost shift and plan design be proposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7162.672s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We here in the city of Medford are under the GIC plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7165.914s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And under the GIC plan, we agreed by subscription and definition and signatory signing off in August of 2011 that we would accept whatever GIC was going to present, whether they be for the cost, whether they be for the, for whatever the costs were,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7180.907s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that people chose in their health plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7183.648s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, if we go to this unilateral change, the question, and the question still hasn't been answered, and GIC has yet to answer it, does the unilateral change mean that the manager or the mayor of a community can unilaterally make that change, or do they need the confirmation support by the local legislative body?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7204.012s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In this case, it would be the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7206.678s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what we had to do years ago when Mayor McGlynn accepted GIC.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7210.88s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was presented before the Medford City Council for a vote of support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7215.861s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, the ludicrous part about this whole thing is you're asked to vote on something, but you can't discuss it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7221.503s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That makes no sense at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7223.464s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Absolutely no sense at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7225.185s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And again, I don't know where you're going to be going, but I think those of you that aren't on GIC and have an opportunity to speak<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7232.584s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and make your representation known to the employees and the retirees of the city, this is going to be huge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7239.029s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the reason why it's going to be huge, because the state's use of this increase is projected at approximately 3.6%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7247.935s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But it also provides that these costs are running at large because of MassHealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7256.201s">[Robert Penta]</a>: MassHealth is a $14 billion item in the state's budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7260.984s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It represents approximately<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7262.902s">[Robert Penta]</a>: 40% of the state's budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7264.843s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And because it represents 40% of the state budget, whatever those cost overruns have been over the past two or three years, they are now being shifted over, as in the administration and finance report the other day came out and said that everyone's going to have to bear the cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7280.648s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, I don't think everybody should have to bear the cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7283.069s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't think an active working employee and more importantly a retiree should have to pay for that cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7288.371s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They didn't cause that cost increase to take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7291.433s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think the legislature on Beacon Hill, they need to do their work and they need to get into reading what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7297.496s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They need to understand that the cost of health care and drugs and prescriptions<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7304.205s">[Robert Penta]</a>: is huge here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7305.566s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We are the most expensive country in the world, and we are the most expensive state in the country as a result of health care costs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7313.59s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In January of 2017, this month, there was a Freedman health care report that came out that so describes the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7324.128s">[Robert Penta]</a>: in the position that it's in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7325.968s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We pay an awful lot for health care in Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7328.789s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yes, we do have probably the best hospitals in the world, but that should have nothing to do with how we in cities and towns went out of our way six years ago to negotiate our health care costs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7340.772s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As of January of this year, according to the contract and the memorandum of understanding between the city of Medford<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7346.74s">[Robert Penta]</a>: its retirees and its active employees, as of January this year, we have until January to October 1st to make a definite decision whether we stay in the GIC plan or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7360.31s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if we don't stay in that plan for GIC, we have between October 1st and June 30th of 2018 to make that final decision where we go, whether we go back to competitive bidding, other insurance companies come in and what have you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7376.282s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The contract that Mayor McGlynn signed brings us to 2018, that's six and a half years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7381.644s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The city of Medford was told we would be saving over that six and a half year period of time approximately 25 plus million dollars in health care costs and the rates that were set by GIC would be the rates that would be set for those people who are members of GIC.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7398.746s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This change to go to a unilateral decision, if GIC were to accept it, and the city of Medford were to engage in a unilateral decision, could have an absolute financial devastating effect on retirees and active employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7414.595s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's not what it was meant to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7416.656s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This proposal, unilaterally, is going to shift the cost<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7422.457s">[Robert Penta]</a>: to GIC employees, because if GIC employees go to a unilateral determination, those people who don't have GIC, as compared to those that do, will bear the additional cost as it relates to making the bill be paid here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7441.573s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The other part we should take into consideration is the question, how do we get this question answered?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7451.413s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You folks, those of you that are out there right now, that are not sitting here, but are members of GIC, I think you need to ask the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7460.846s">[Robert Penta]</a>: because it's not expressing a financial interest, it's expressing a need to know whether in fact the city of Medford is going to continue on with GIC.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7469.59s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if the city of Medford is not going to continue on with GIC, you as a legislative body, I'm assuming we'll have to make that decision by choice of change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7479.494s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the mayor should be making this type of representation before you, this type of consideration before you as to where and what effect it's going to have here within your budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7490.998s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let's see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7495.001s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7496.022s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This brings us to the matter of how do we pursue section 13, 14, and 15 and the memorandum of agreement between the city of Medford and its retirees and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7514.736s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and it's retirees and everyday workers, regular workers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7518.697s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These action alerts coming from the Commonwealth of Mass, coming from the Office of Administration and Finance, participating municipalities such as we, and the memorandum of understanding that we have over here, it's very important, it's very important to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7532.36s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's very important to understand that by June 30th of 2018, you folks are gonna have to know where you're gonna go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7540.022s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But it's the retirees,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7542.332s">[Robert Penta]</a>: who are the important component of all of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7544.393s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because they should not have the shifted burden of having the increase in cost for medical services through the insurance company for which they are represented by people who negotiate here with the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7557.959s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, we talk about a lot of things around here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7561.384s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But this is equally as important as maybe to zoning, because we're talking about our municipal employees, we're talking about our school department employees, we're talking about union and non-union members, because they all come under this insurance situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7574.748s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But when you think about the increase in cost, your cost in your food, your cost in your taxes that just went up, your water and sewer rates that have just gone up, you have a Community Preservation Act tax that went up, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7587.631s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All types of insurances that have gone up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7590.192s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And most recently, since January 11, you have people concerned over whether their employment as it relates to vacation time was going to be an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7600.382s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's gone back and forth as to what it's all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7603.926s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's making it harder and harder for our municipal employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7607.069s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They don't make an awful lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7608.591s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They work for their job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7609.552s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're good employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7611.173s">[Robert Penta]</a>: 99% of them are good employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7613.207s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But they have a right to know where they're going and to shop around, if need be the case, to pick out a health care provider.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7619.349s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the city owes it to every single municipal employee and retiree to let them know whether they're going to be on board or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7625.751s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So Mr. President, through you, I would respectfully ask that, since you're not a member of JIC, that I would respectfully ask that you ask of the president administration, however the answer needs to come in,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7637.696s">[Robert Penta]</a>: whether the unilateral proposal, if approved by GIC, empowers the mayor of this community to make independent decisions, that for which GIC, for which we are presently under, would not, I mean, that's the whole issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7653.439s">[Robert Penta]</a>: February 1st, there's a huge hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7656.1s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're asking many, many people to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7658.501s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Last time when this issue became a fact, 80,000 emails, 80,000 emails were sent to GIC.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7665.374s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And unfortunately, they didn't listen to them and they didn't adhere to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7668.635s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I would hope in this situation... Excuse me, Council Member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7675.838s">[Robert Penta]</a>: At this particular time, Mr. President, this is an important issue, but this is an issue to talk about now, well in advance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7681.86s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As the memorandum of understanding indicates, it indicates here as of January,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7686.583s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe January of this year, 2017, between January and October 17th, the city has to make its decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7693.945s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They should be talking right now with the bargaining units of all 14 signatories that signed up on this memorandum of understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7701.387s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I would hope, Mr. President, that when February 1st comes at 1230 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7707.089s">[Robert Penta]</a>: at 19 Standover Street in Boston, we can get as many people as we can there to tell them we do not want to go to this unilateral<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7713.715s">[Robert Penta]</a>: this unilateral allowance because that's going to basically cost shift, cost shift, whatever the deficit is running in mass health as part of it over to the GIC people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7725.019s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They didn't cause it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7726.54s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're willing to pay their fair share, but it's going up and it's, and it's just not right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7731.642s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's just not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7733.322s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And just as a side note, and I don't mean to be humorous, but Christmas is over, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7740.665s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7741.173s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is there any reason why the Christmas lights are still up on the building outside?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7744.074s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I do not have that answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7747.114s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's not the main to the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7749.235s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I understand that, but we got to move on unless they're up early for next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7753.495s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7753.956s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maybe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7754.356s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the question is simply this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7757.056s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would hope you folks and through the chair, Mr. President, you get that answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7760.417s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's an important answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7761.697s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you can get it before February 1st, it would be great because somebody has to have that answer as it relates to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7767.038s">[Robert Penta]</a>: your, well, it's not yours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7768.118s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're on your private one, you know, but those who are retirees, those who are employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7771.98s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I want to thank that union representative who put that out there on Facebook, who made the request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7776.621s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Cause that's what got me on this particular kick to go forward and make this presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7781.603s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7986.746s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7988.507s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7989.287s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Name and address of the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7990.448s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Bob Pinter again, Zero Summit Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7992.229s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A quick question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7993.07s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He just jogged my mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7994.271s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I asked you, and hopefully through your chair, you will ask that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7997.073s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The second part of the question should have been as follows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=7999.294s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If, in fact, we go to this unilateral, if GIC goes to unilaterally, does that mean the local legislative body<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8005.503s">[Robert Penta]</a>: has to make an approval on what the mayor, the executive officer would do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8009.085s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Cause that's going to be extremely important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8010.846s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That was the requirement back in 2011 when we accepted it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8014.289s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But now the six and a half year contract is going to be over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8017.33s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Nobody knows what that language is going to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8019.332s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I think it would be incumbent, hopefully upon you, Mr. President, to ask both of those questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8023.854s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If GIC goes to a unilateral program and if the city of Medford were to go in that direction, does the mayor unilaterally do it or does she need support?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8032.962s">[Robert Penta]</a>: from all 14 union people for approval before the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8051.451s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So could you ask that question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8052.612s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Could somebody put that question forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8055.213s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The question is if the city, if GIC adopts the unilateral program,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8060.547s">[Robert Penta]</a>: does that mean the chief executive officer of a city be in this case of mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8064.788s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Can she independently make changes which could possibly be cost shift changes to retirees as well as employees if the city opts out to go to a different union type of a different healthcare provider?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8080.433s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Hopefully we'll have all that information for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8374.71s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Wait a minute, I asked for a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8377.623s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It should be placed on file, because that's the problem around here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8380.344s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Just take everything and place it on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8382.145s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There was a motion to ask, and you said you were going to pursue it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8416.39s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, you were asked to make a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8419.811s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yes, you can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8420.291s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're not the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=8421.032s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're not allowed to make a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=694.83s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=696.137s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Name and address of the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=697.078s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name, my name is Robert Penter, zero summit road method, Massachusetts, former member of this board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=702.701s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Um, I have no question about remediate, uh, remediating the land, but there are some issues here that haven't been resolved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=709.265s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And two of them in particular were brought up at the December meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=712.286s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Um, where's the law that allows for this number one and where was, and where's the public hearing on a March 14th of 2014 in a meeting that took place with the Medford office of environmental affairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=726.607s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There were a host of folks that were there, including myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=729.848s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And in there, there was an EPA rules and regulation that basically states the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=734.349s">[Robert Penta]</a>: EPA regulation states that there will be a public meeting that will be advertised through the standard public meeting notification channels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=745.171s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that was in reference to the fact that just what you asked about, Mr. President, and for the public, there is yet to be a public hearing meeting regarding this amount of money of $900,000<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=756.777s">[Robert Penta]</a>: for this particular transfer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=758.937s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was stated and quoted at the last meeting, there would be anywheres from between 75 to 100 injection points that would be placed into the ground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=766.959s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Brown and Caldwell, who we spent well over $100,000, indicated that that would take two drilling rigs in no more than 10 to 15 days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=776.481s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You were told this past December it would take approximately a month of disruption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=781.122s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That goes to your point, Councilman Longs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=783.822s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Also, the soil depth of 20 to 25 feet,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=787.573s">[Robert Penta]</a>: which is found on the GZA report, indicates that their cost, their estimation, and they were the people that reviewed the Brown and Caulfield, their cost was between $2.4 to $2.9 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=801.879s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Brown and Caulfield said it would cost the city approximately $1.8 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=806.381s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you're looking at $900,000 that's now being presented before you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=810.643s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So these are issues that I think that still needs to be addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=815.125s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And also,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=817.273s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The city of Medford had a projected analysis that took place in August, July of 2015, for which I have here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=824.318s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It talks about the cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=825.419s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It talks about the remediation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=828.121s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, I spoke to the Bureau of Accounts at the Department of Revenue, and they have a rule and regulation that is very specific as it relates to what you can and cannot do as it relates to this particular thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=840.19s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's guideline 08-101.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=843.632s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it says, for what services can a community adopt an enterprise fund?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=847.874s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It goes into all the issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=849.814s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yes, no, we're different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=850.935s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But then it says the community may not, may not establish enterprise funds for normal government operations or services, such as public safety, inspectional services, or cemeteries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=865.458s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're talking about something here that's remediation of land, dirty soil, before you even get down to 20 to 25 feet of wherever that water might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=876.401s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You cannot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=878.297s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and I defy anyone here to show me a case or an authorization where enterprise funds money, water and sewer enterprise funds money were used to remediate dirty soil that's there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=890.981s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You were there right from the beginning, Councilor Caraviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=893.162s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You heard the commentary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=894.943s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You saw the businesses that have been affected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=897.884s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you go forward with this vote tonight without having a legal determination that it can be done, and also without contacting the Department of Revenue, Division of Local Services,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=907.642s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and explain to them this is the reason why you want to spend your $900,000 out of an enterprise fund for which they can give you an opinion whether you can or cannot do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=916.968s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And we had this conversation in December.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=919.03s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm a little bit shocked that both of these young ladies that work for the mayor haven't brought any of that information forward that would justify.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=925.915s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So all that seems to take place that took place in December and now, nothing has changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=930.458s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's just sat on the table, and whatever packet of information you got,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=934.176s">[Robert Penta]</a>: over the weekend, so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=936.117s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you have a legal quandary here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=937.658s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you're talking about the taxpayers' money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=939.879s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're talking about approximately $8 million that's in free cash that could be used for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=944.622s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as the law so states, unless there's something on the boards, on the boards within 90 days for water and sewer street reconstruction, that money has to go back to the ratepayers because it's a surplus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=956.009s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's a surplus that the ratepayers have been overcharged with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=960.051s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The intent of the project sounds good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=962.365s">[Robert Penta]</a>: cleaning up the property and moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=964.446s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But there's a process that needs to take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=967.027s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I would strongly suggest to you, since you don't have any legal determination, nothing from the Department of Revenue, a Bureau of Accounts standard that's operational each and every day for all cities and towns as it relates to enterprise funds, I would suggest that you, instead of take the money out of the enterprise fund, you take it out of your free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=987.416s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Or before you even go one step further, so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=991.241s">[Robert Penta]</a>: To say that, you know, it's, it's three years overdue and now we're going to get an extension.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=996.663s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Whose fault is it for three years overdue?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=998.444s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think the council has been asking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1000.304s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I know when I was on here, I went to all those meetings and there was supposed to be updated meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1004.886s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You haven't had the public hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1006.827s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's an EPA regulation and rule requirement for the community as a whole, for the businesses, so they can understand what's going on and to get some input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1016.911s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where's the input from the community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1018.912s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where's the public hearing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1020.837s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And why, at this point in time, would you even want to take a chance in having the State Department of Revenue question you when it comes to do your annual assessment on money and budget projections coming back to the city of Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1033.54s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I say this with all due respect to the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1035.66s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Sounds good that people are going to say, well, all of a sudden we're going to get the land, we're going to get the West Medford parking lot, and the brownfields remediated for $900,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1044.022s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have two figures from two outside concerns, $1.9 million on one,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1049.763s">[Robert Penta]</a>: anywhere from 2.2 to 2.5, 2.6 on another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1054.685s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I think somebody needs to explain to you the difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1057.847s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I've got everything right here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1058.888s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'd be more than happy to spend hours with you to explain and tell you what the differences are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1063.69s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I think that's your job right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1065.951s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And your job is to make sure that you make an intelligent decision, not a decision that's been hanging around since December.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1071.534s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you still, you still don't have the appropriate information to make this vote this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1077.557s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3784.735s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Name and address of the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3785.836s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Uh, Robert Pinto, zero summit road method, mass from a member of the sport.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3789.754s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The part that I think should be established before this board, you folks are the only ones that can actually change a bus stop for whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3799.856s">[Robert Penta]</a>: For the MBTA to turn around and change the bus stop arbitrarily for whatever their reasons allegedly are, I don't think you can do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3806.318s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think one of the problems you're going to have is the fact that they're going to tell you they don't come out to nighttime meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3811.439s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're not getting paid to do that anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3813.479s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, you're talking about a public safety issue, but you're also talking about an issue<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3817.51s">[Robert Penta]</a>: where you have a bridge here in Medford Square, and they're allegedly only halfway through a year and a half into the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3822.371s">[Robert Penta]</a>: For the last three weeks, they've had nobody working there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3824.711s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And by having nobody working there, they've completely or could have helped out a couple of the businesses on that right-hand side of the street, but instead they just left the place a total mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3834.233s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So it's just a shame to think that the state can grant out these contracts to these contractors that'll probably be running two or three jobs at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3843.805s">[Robert Penta]</a>: to the demise of the Medford taxpayer and the Medford taxpaying business person here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3850.389s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My suggestion would be that not only you get your state delegation and your state senator, I mean, they're the ones that control the purse strings for the Department of Transportation and for the MBTA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3859.873s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And there is no reason for something like this to happen without you folks being notified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3864.376s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And by doing that, hopefully, by bringing, I would suggest that you have a meeting right here before the Medford City Council and have it discussed in the open unless anyone who has a concern about it, they should be here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3876.626s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the people that really should be behind all of this is the Chamber of Commerce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3881.009s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's their business that's being affected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3883.691s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if their business is getting affected, it's also,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3886.535s">[Robert Penta]</a>: the people who patronize those businesses in the area of public safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3890.679s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So for the MBTA to make their decision without consulting with you, I think they have it in the opposite way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3896.043s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think, I think it's upon you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3898.005s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's your responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3899.426s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Like it was mine when I was there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3900.988s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You guys are vested with the fact you're right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3902.869s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Nothing is grandfathered in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3904.411s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think you should just need to take the bull by the horns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3906.352s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if in fact, if in fact they don't want to come at a nighttime meeting, I would suggest that you send a certified letter to Charlie Baker, the governor of this Commonwealth and just tell him,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3914.086s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that you're not doing the right thing by your department heads by saying that they refuse to come to a nighttime meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3919.407s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is not right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3920.188s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=3921.148s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it doesn't make sense for public safety and for the bus stop locations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3702.073s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Good evening, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3703.153s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Congratulations on your term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3705.243s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, former member of the Saugus Party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3709.705s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On the issue of branding, I'll get to that first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3711.926s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Alan, maybe just an idea that you can call it the Lawrence Memorial Hospital slash the division of the Welfare, Welforce Group, because I think the community would respect the idea that the merger is taking place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3722.53s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3723.451s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a great place to have an opportunity to move forward, but at the same time, this community knows the hospital is the Lawrence Memorial Hospital.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3729.885s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as a division of welfare, that might be the catalyst to get other communities to be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3734.989s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But my concern is, you folks have all mentioned it, but there's a debt obligation to the Malden Hospital, to the Lawrence Memorial Hospital, or Hallmark has.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3743.635s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And there hasn't been any comment as it relates to the fact is how does that debt obligation work when the three hospitals get together and I don't just know if it's a third, I don't know how it's going to be proportioned out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3755.035s">[Robert Penta]</a>: at who has the majority vote and how the vote's going to take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3758.296s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But whatever the multi-million dollars that are left on that hospital debt obligation that's needed, how is that going to interact, number one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3764.899s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And number two, when something needs to take place as far as development, for which all of you folks have talked about the development, who's going to come first in line for it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3773.123s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, if two hospitals have the same idea, is wellness going to allow both hospitals to do the same thing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3779.045s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Are you going to split up the types of developments that you're going to have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3782.847s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think that would be beneficial for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3785.358s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A, the community to know, but also the doctors, the nurses and the programs that you're going to be having here at the, uh, at the Lawrence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3792.561s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Um, so with that being said, and I know it's a financial consideration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3797.323s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The last part of the question would be on an annual basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3800.404s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm quite sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3801.725s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is this merger independent or is it conclusive of all together?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3806.106s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the profits are split three ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3808.387s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then the Lawrence can go on its merry way and take whatever that money is for whatever its purpose is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3813.467s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm assuming, and they would assume, cause you said, um, Mr. McDonald, you said we will be responsible for our own obligations and that's an outstanding obligation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3823.032s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I think we need to have, I'd like to have that question answered as a taxpayer in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3827.995s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Um, I think it's great that the merger is taking place, but I still think these are a couple of questions that need to be answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3834.259s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I, and I think it would be good for the community to know where we're going because I know it was council Falco has and council Longo current and some members of the council have attended meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3842.576s">[Robert Penta]</a>: as to what's going to be the development of the Malden Hospital.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3845.498s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Once that sale takes place, does that money go into the pot of the kitty or does that go just strictly to the Lawrence Memorial Hospital?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3852.164s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I would appreciate it through the chair, Mr. President, if Mr. McDonald could answer those questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3857.188s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Alan, can you answer Councilor Penter's concerns?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7757.785s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Um, well, it sounds like it's a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7761.627s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, for the city to go out of its way to get this grant, to put a piece of parkland in a position where you could probably do something else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7769.73s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I just don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7770.935s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, the part that seems to be very disturbing, they can go out of their way to find money, whether it be for this park land.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7776.636s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this past week, an application went in for the Medford Public Library, which is all good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7780.597s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These are all good causes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7782.058s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you have a Medford police station that's completely coming apart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7785.979s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's lost its value.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7787.139s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You go back to 2009, Councilman Marks brought forward a complaint from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts saying that the building was unfit for its habitation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7794.961s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The city did nothing on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7796.041s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The city refused to condemn it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7797.681s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's in a state of disrepair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7799.522s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There is nothing going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7801.245s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you try to explain this to the people in the city of Medford, you're spending $250,000, almost $500,000 to rehabilitate a place in Medford Square that you would have to leave like that ad infinitum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7812.737s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It just doesn't make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7813.958s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It doesn't relate to not only development of Medford Square, it just doesn't relate to spending your money in the right way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7821.446s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There are so many things that need to take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7824.372s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I just don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7825.132s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think today, most recently, the administration just hired another assistant in one of the departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7831.193s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, it would be nice if you folks and ladies, you know, were advised as to what's going on when the hiring takes place here and to have some kind of an opportunity to really need all these people at these expensive salaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7842.636s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, you just got through, unfortunately, insulting the kids from the vocational school, not you as a Councilor, but the city administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7848.985s">[Robert Penta]</a>: by trying to hide and not use the Christmas gifts of building these things that they had around here for City Hall, and then you go put them down at Hormel Stadium, and the city administration says we're gonna have another dedicating ceremony for which never took place for that, but you're standing here, but you're standing here as it relates to spending $250,000 and accepting a grant that you'll have no control over the use of the property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7872.497s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It makes absolutely no sense at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7874.238s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I agree with you, Councilman Marks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7876.159s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was your idea in the beginning just to refurbish it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7878.952s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But for that kind of money, try to explain that to the guy in the street who's trying to save money to buy a new refrigerator or a washing machine and do some upgrading in his house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=7888.058s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The city should change its priorities as it relates to how they want to spend their development money and for its future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8416.056s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8417.678s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Just one point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8418.278s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maybe I misunderstood something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8420.338s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Did you just say that this is the beginning of the starting of the building of the square?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8424.2s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a starting point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8425.441s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where's the report on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8426.521s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And who presented that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8427.542s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And where is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8429.263s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's no one presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8429.983s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a starting point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8431.184s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Who said it's the starting point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8432.184s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I said it's the starting point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8433.985s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So don't let's mislead the people by saying it's the starting point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8440.428s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The starting point of the building in the square is those poor businesses that are being affected by a bridge that's got another year and a half to go over there, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8447.631s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And they can't get the right of day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8448.972s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And no one from this city, hall, has gone down to any one of those businesses and asked them, how is their business, how has it been affected?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8455.194s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They have a bus stop issue they can't even get resolved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8457.696s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you're talking about taking $250,000 and putting it on a piece of property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8465.859s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No one from this building has gone down there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8468.44s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, I think you go out and go talk to the people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8471.001s">[Robert Penta]</a>: More importantly, more importantly, Mr. President, you're making this a permanent piece of property that you cannot touch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8477.123s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you cannot touch it, what's the sense of taking it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8479.624s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're being restricted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8480.885s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you're being restricted, you council Longo current, you said it's an expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8517.683s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And right now the park, if I understand it correctly, and I can be corrected,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8522.351s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's in perpetuity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8523.211s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Councilor Lingo-Curran, she's the lawyer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8524.892s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Perpetuity means it stays the way it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8527.013s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8528.253s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8530.234s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What is your rush, Councilor De La Rosa?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8531.755s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You want to get home early?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8532.675s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have a customer waiting for you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8535.356s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Listen, I would like to make my point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8538.997s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're taking city money to match it and to get paid back on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8543.879s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The unfortunate part is, don't have people misled that this is the beginning of changing the revitalization of Bedford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8550.261s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When you haven't even had the business people, you haven't even had the chamber come in to have a discussion on how it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8558.563s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You haven't, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=8559.843s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you're on the chamber and you've been there long enough and you should know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3167.715s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Penta zero summit road, Medford mass, former member of this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3172.318s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if I was sitting on this side of the rail tonight, I'd be making the same proposal that I want to say to it this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3177.836s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I've been following this story now for a few days, and it's been evident over the last three days in the Boston Herald.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3184.22s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's a story regarding a young man.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3185.761s">[Robert Penta]</a>: His name is DJ Simons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3188.202s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He's a Boston police officer, 28 years old.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3191.684s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He is the unsung hero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3192.825s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He is the forgotten man in the Boston Marathon story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3197.167s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what I would like to propose and ask you as Medford City Councilors to do on behalf of our city, knowing that we have that great monument out there for the Crystal Campbell Peace Garden,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3207.313s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that represents our city, who recognizes in times of tragedy, we do stand to the occasion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3213.735s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We put our political principles aside, and we do unify amongst ourselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3219.097s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This gentleman, 28 years old, was hit by a bomb, pipe bomb, four days after the incident that took place at the Boston Marathon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3227.96s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He was one of the first officers on the scene.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3230.461s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as a result of that, he received a head injury.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3233.022s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And he died subsequently one year later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3235.543s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as a result of that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3237.553s">[Robert Penta]</a>: His mother, Roxanne Simons, and father, who lived down in the Cape, were never notified of this story called Patriots Day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3245.916s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They called up the producers, Peter Berg, Mark Wahlberg, and they have yet to receive a response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3252.339s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Fellow Boston police officers are aware of what took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3257.901s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A state representative up on Beacon Hill named Tim Whelan<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3262.032s">[Robert Penta]</a>: made an application to the, um, the board of the directors and the film director, uh, for, uh, Patriot's day and asked them if they would consider doing a post script somehow of putting it in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3274.455s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Never got a response back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3276.675s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The part that was hurting and disturbing according to Mrs. Simons is the fact that when they can't at the end of the movie, the postscripts of the movie had the four pitches and the four names of the folks that we have in our peace garden.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3288.998s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But Mr. Simon's name was, was not there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3291.722s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This gentleman is 28 years old.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3293.422s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He's a college graduate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3295.143s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And subsequently, on graduating college, he went to the Boston Police School to become a Boston police officer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3300.424s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He was originally stationed in Brighton, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3302.904s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But he was more of wanting to be not a Boston police officer who hands out tickets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3307.145s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He wanted to get into the inner city youth, and that's where he did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3310.546s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He went into the inner city youth where the problems were, and he loved it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3314.467s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He was a good police officer, loved by many policemen, and loved by his community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3320.534s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He unfortunately has not even received any kind of recognition throughout this whole program called Patriot's Day, which is a great movie if you want to look at it like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3329.561s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as they do say, sometimes there are some errors and there's some slips to get through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3334.365s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But they were notified well in advance, and they're still notified as of now, that maybe to have him recognized as being an unsung hero who died, unfortunately, one year after the tragedy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3345.573s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He was one of the first people, one of the first people<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3348.175s">[Robert Penta]</a>: of Boston police responders to Watertown Mass on the night of that incident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3353.017s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, all my council colleagues, you folks do many resolutions for many people, whether they are for sports, whether they are for someone who might have passed away, whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3365.083s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But for the family of this police officer, I think it would be outstanding that this Medford City Council recognizes the fact that this gentleman, DJ Simons,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3375.402s">[Robert Penta]</a>: who didn't get recognized, is recognized by the city of Medford, its city government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3381.123s">[Robert Penta]</a>: For the gentleman did give his life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3382.924s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He did respond and he was there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3386.125s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And for his parents not to have any recognition to that at all, it's just not right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3390.966s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I don't think it's fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3392.706s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I ask of you, seven of you collectively, for one of you to offer the resolution, or if jointly, to send a note of condolences and of appreciation and of thanks to the Simons family, thanking them for their sons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3405.776s">[Robert Penta]</a>: efforts as a result of the Boston Marathon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3409.018s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And maybe there is something, somehow, some way, a plaque of postscript can find its way to that Peace Garden as well here in the city of Medford to let the entire world, to let the entire people know and to let the Simons family know that the city of Medford will not forget and they're most appreciative of what their son did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3428.033s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I offer, I ask one of you to come forward and do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3431.815s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mayor Marty Walsh of Boston, as of today's paper,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3435.683s">[Robert Penta]</a>: has he himself has taken it upon himself to seek out through the producers and the directors of that show who have refused, I shouldn't say refused, who have yet to respond back to him to have him included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3447.709s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What the reason is, nobody knows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3450.29s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But it's a known fact, it is a known fact that that gentleman died in the line of duty protecting the citizens, doing his job as a police officer in behalf of the citizens of this commonwealth and the citizens of Boston and for the people who participated in that Boston Marathon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3877.401s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Please state your name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3879.463s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert Pence is zero summit road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3880.724s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Method mast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3881.445s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Uh, just to jump onto what council Caraviello has alluded to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3884.247s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Are you at a gentleman up here about six months ago complaining about he drove down the street, not only did he break his spring, but it was a full tank of gas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3890.352s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, oil, God forbid that that oil didn't go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3893.275s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The city has now been put on notice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3894.736s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is the second time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3896.266s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're doing streets all over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3897.566s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You just got through doing Governor's Avenue from top to bottom on one side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3900.627s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've been doing other streets in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3902.688s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Here is a commercial street that is just begging for an accident to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3907.15s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And unfortunately, it's probably going to cause the city a major lawsuit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3910.371s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So as Councilor Caraviello has alluded to, I think it's something that needs to take place immediately before an accident does happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3915.872s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if that does happen, then you'd have OSHA and everybody else down here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3918.553s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So, you know, once informed, shame on you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3921.054s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Twice informed, look out because that's a lawsuit waiting to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3924.088s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I don't think you'd really wanna have something like that right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3926.949s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5710.491s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Penter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5711.471s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I live at zero summit Road method mass at the outset I'd like to congratulate councillor Caraviello and coming the incoming president for next year and councillor marks I believe you the incoming vice president<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5722.397s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I have some concerns over this subject matter, because having served on the city council, I've been a part of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5728.499s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And some of my concerns reflect upon the following issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5731.62s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Number one, when we talk about the $900,000 that you folks are being asked to appropriate here tonight, first $200,000 supposedly is coming from the remaining amount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5740.983s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There is nothing in here that talks about change orders or this being a fixed fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5745.865s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you really don't have anything in front of you that tells you that this is going to be a definitive number, because this number could escalate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5752.627s">[Robert Penta]</a>: if, in fact, things were to change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5755.428s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if, in fact, this is a $900,000 project, why are you folks paying for it up front at 100%?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5761.149s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If this is going to be a two-, three-year project, why wouldn't you be paying for it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5764.829s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why wouldn't the city be proposing to make a payment over a three-year period of time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5769.41s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That way there, according to the engineer, she's not guaranteeing anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5773.211s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the fact of the matter is, if this thing doesn't work out, at least you have some leverage to go back to make sure that they do what they're supposed to do, or something needs to be changed to correct the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5782.546s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That'll take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5784.147s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And also taking into consideration this is an excessive $1 million project, there doesn't seem to be any bond performance that seems to be being presented here, protecting the city's asset, which is its cash, which is that of the Medford public taxpayer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5799.117s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you're looking at a cost factor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5801.599s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't have anything in front of you that tells you that a bond performance is going to be had here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5806.122s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's nothing telling you as to why you're paying it up front rather than over an extended period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5811.78s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That, to me, would present a concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5815.082s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Also, I don't know if there was an enviro-forensic analysis that took place relative to the composition of what the problem is in the ground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5827.608s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These are specialist people who come in, and I'm quite sure that our city engineer is aware of these type of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5832.833s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're experts, and they can tell you that what and if the city is using is the right treatment to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5838.577s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5839.638s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The last time I know of a public hearing on this matter, because I attended it, was in August of 2015.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5845.043s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And in that report that took place and presented in August of 2015, a public hearing was supposed to take place before this Medford City Council<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5855.908s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and for the people of Medford and for the people affected in the West Medford area to come forward to listen to what's being presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5864.093s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You are being presented the lowest of the numbers as compared to the highest of the numbers to resolve this problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5870.617s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think you're aware of this, Councilor Caraviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5872.558s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think you're aware of the fact, because you were there with me at the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5875.359s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This 900,000 figure is the lowest of whatever it's going to cost to remediate this particular project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5881.463s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The city of Medford and the taxpayers<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5883.236s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And those business owners, as Councilman Max has alluded to, deserve more and deserve better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5887.258s">[Robert Penta]</a>: To wait almost three years and hold your property up for almost three years cancels out any idea of the fact that the property can be sold and somebody would have to come in and deal with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5898.104s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you're going to go out for a bid, maybe the bid should go out and be inclusive of the fact that if somebody's going to come in and make a bid,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5904.928s">[Robert Penta]</a>: to do this project, maybe the bid should include somebody wanting to buy the product, buy this particular subject matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5911.997s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And maybe that person who buys it will have to pay for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5915.341s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Therefore, if we are going to go out of our way to pay to remediate this piece of property,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5920.996s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then once it's remediated, and if it's corrected properly, the business owners then go out and sell the property at a much higher rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5928.459s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Who loses out on that particular deal?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5930.52s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that particular deal, the city loses out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5932.881s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I think your options need to be put both ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5935.502s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maybe somebody coming in who wants to buy the property, or somebody coming in to remediate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5940.044s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let's just see what's out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5941.504s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Who's offering whatever needs to be offered?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5943.705s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5945.026s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You also talked about the fact that you want to take this money<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5951.588s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you want to take it from the Water Enterprise Retained Earnings Account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5956.192s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, we all know that the enterprise account here in the city of Medford dates back to 1983, 1984, when the city of Medford first entertained it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5964.219s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And we know that the city of Medford's enterprise fund, its enterprise fund, is one that's considered, for its best practice, and for this fund, it's for water, sewer, and stormwater systems, period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5978.271s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The law is very specific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5980.312s">[Robert Penta]</a>: when it turns around and tells you what it cannot be used for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5984.115s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The community may not establish enterprise funds for normal government operations or services such as public safety, inspectional services, or cemeteries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5995.005s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is a public safety issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=5996.866s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This public safety issue wraps itself around an environmental issue and maybe a public health issue, but it's a public safety issue first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6003.822s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This has got nothing to do with your infrastructure of water, stormwater, or infrastructure for any of these pipes that are going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6012.368s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The City of Medford presently sits on over, I believe, close to $9 million in your free cash account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6018.313s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If the City of Medford wants to go forward and pay for this without disturbing that process of profit that you have almost $8.5 million in your water and sewer account,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6027.092s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have nothing presented before you tonight that talks about any kind of major infrastructure in this community, nothing more than fixing a parking lot that's been there for many, many years that the city's had control over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6039.997s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think you're doing a disservice not only to yourselves, but to the enterprise fund account, because that money is there for a specific purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6048.84s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Plus the fact enterprise account, on an annual basis,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6052.148s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The accounting needs to come forward as to tell you what they're going to spend their money on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6056.691s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And now you're getting a hit for $900,000 right now that was not put in any part of the budget, no public hearing has taken place, and the city administration wants you to go forward and spend this money on something that's going to take almost a three-year process, and you're paying up front.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6074.353s">[Robert Penta]</a>: something that's not even going to be guaranteed by any kind of a bond performance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6078.054s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What if the contractor goes bust, goes, becomes bankrupt?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6082.356s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where does the city go then?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6084.357s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, you've got to protect your assets here and the assets is the taxpayer's money for what needs to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6092.3s">[Robert Penta]</a>: More importantly, you know, when you sit here and you think about all the things you talk about on a daily basis, you know, things that you might, you may want to call this environmental.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6101.403s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You may want to call it public health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6102.543s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You may want to call it public safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6104.599s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you're taking money from an account that it shouldn't be coming from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6108.58s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Unless somebody can come up before this podium and explain to you that Medford's Water and Sewer account, its Water and Sewer Enterprise account, can legally transfer this money, for which the law under Chapter 44, Section 58, F and a half, and 44, Section 38 and 43 says that you can't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6129.924s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the Department of Revenue also says that you can't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6134.069s">[Robert Penta]</a>: under the Bureau accounts under the guideline release of 08-101.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6139.071s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You cannot transfer this money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6148.674s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, when we had this discussion a few years ago and then keep bringing it forward and we're going forward and we're bringing it forward for the next three years or whatever it might be, there's no guarantee here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6157.557s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's no guarantee here that this is going to work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6159.558s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6160.32s">[Robert Penta]</a>: with the city engineer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6161.12s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Nothing's guaranteed in life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6162.381s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maybe the only thing that's guaranteed is we're all going to die someday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6165.361s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But while we're alive and while we're elected to do the people's business, maybe we should look at all our options that we need to have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6172.403s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You need to have that public hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6174.183s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You need to present it before the city, the people of the city, to the public, to the taxpayers over here, and to yourselves as to know what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6181.405s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You need to know all your financial options and how we're getting to them and how you are getting to them tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6186.266s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Right now, you've got $900,000 being asked to transfer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6189.855s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would respectfully state that I would put that on hold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6192.517s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would request if you want to take it out of free cash, if in fact it's that important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6197.66s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I really think you need to have that public hearing and to hear all the comments from all the people and to understand what the valuation is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6203.725s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you need your city assessor down here because you're going to take the evaluations of the property today, right now, which can't be sold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6209.929s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Some of them can't be sold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6211.73s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as it's going to be in three years, if in fact it is remediated, whether it can be sold,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6216.152s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So that means the city of Medford is going to spend in excess of a million dollars, if not more, to make somebody else's property beneficial to be sold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6223.86s">[Robert Penta]</a>: True, they did not cause the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6226.342s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But we need to look.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6227.123s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're looking at the short term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6228.364s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm looking at the long term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6229.465s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the long term tells me you need to have more of a discussion on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6232.808s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This has been hanging around for a long period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6235.991s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think you need another committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6237.552s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You definitely need that public hearing because that was part and parcel of the $100,000 cost that the city paid to have an outside consultant come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6246.756s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you remember correctly, they also paid $5,000 for another company to come in to check over the $100,000 consultant's report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6254.539s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you really need to take a look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6256.72s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you really need to understand that you're buying the lowest of whatever was proposed to remediate the problem, hoping that it would resolve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6269.885s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Nice to meet you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6464.202s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6469.673s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Quick correction here, I want to make my point clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6473.776s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The Department of Revenue through its Bureau of Accounts indicates that every community with an enterprise fund establish a written internal policy regarding indirect cost allocations and should review this policy annually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6487.124s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's an annually written report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6489.365s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is an indirect cost to the normal water and sewer account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6494.788s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if in fact the new city auditor indicated that it's legal<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6499.419s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Show me a case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6500.3s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Show us a city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6501.121s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Strike that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6502.302s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Show you folks a case and a city where this has taken place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6506.486s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is not within the guidelines as provided under the Massachusetts General Laws, and it's not provided in the Department of Revenue Bureau of Accounts guidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6515.774s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, if she can produce a case that says that you can take that money from there, that's all well and good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6520.299s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As I said, I've yet to find it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6521.9s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's yet to be proven to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6523.422s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I think it needs to be proven to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6525.34s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because $900,000 is a lot of money to take out of a surplus account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6529.143s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you take that money out of your water and sewer account, the better question is, why are you sitting on $8.5 million when people throughout this whole community talk about water pressure problems up in the heights?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6540.131s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They talk about groundwater problems in certain parts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6543.974s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have storm drains that can't hold water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6546.817s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These are the projects you should be talking about if you want to talk about water and sewer account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6550.96s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this dollar amount was never mentioned anywhere in the accounting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6555.404s">[Robert Penta]</a>: of this new proposal that's being before you here this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6559.607s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Sounds great if you want to rectify it, but financing is another thing and you have the money in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6565.652s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So why would you want to disturb an account that's there for a particular purpose?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6570.035s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I respectfully disagree with the new director because she doesn't produce anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6574.478s">[Robert Penta]</a>: She's just saying it's legal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6576.179s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, if it's legal, they wouldn't write it in here that you can't use it for that purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6580.262s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And there's no case to be proven that it can be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6582.933s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Once that's before you, I've got no problem, then the choice is yours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6585.915s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I believe as it stands before you right now, you have an option to go another way to fund this if that be the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6591.438s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And again, I respectfully disagree that you can fund, you can negotiate a contract that does take place in segments, not all together up front, because there in itself presents no guarantee to the city of Medford or to you folks that your vote is really gonna be worth anything if that person or that company falls or goes bankrupt or whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6610.509s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you very much, sir.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=6611.689s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7731.739s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Once again, my name is Robert Pantazero, Summit Road, Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7734.741s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm a little bit confused here right now because I never remember sitting on this council in the month of December and voting on something that's projected as a deficit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7743.246s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because if you look at the sewer retained earnings like in the water retained earnings, I believe your budget is 50-50 in this past budget that you had, you did have a proposed increase of one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7754.434s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Folks, would you please quiet down back there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7761.215s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you looked at your budget that you just passed this past year, I believe that there was somewhat of a minimal rate increase there from the water and sewer department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7767.159s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, from the MWRA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7769.4s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Also, your sewer charge is at 121% of your water rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7773.363s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if you're at 121% of your water rate that the customer is paying out back out, but your water side is balanced, but your sewer side isn't balanced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7782.549s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is somebody telling you that your budget proposal that was presented was inaccurate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7787.07s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Have you ever gone through this before, making a paid on a deficit, a projected deficit, and you're not even what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7794.817s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're just no more than six months into your budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7798.32s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So that means your budget that was presented to you that you guys and ladies passed was in deficit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7803.704s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was a deficit budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7805.005s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was incorrect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7806.727s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You were operating with deficits in departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7809.349s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It doesn't make sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7810.53s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I really think you need to take a second look at this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7813.081s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I know she's new to the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7815.222s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know if she's new to this whole idea of where we're going with this and if you want to put this in a projection because you want to set a tax rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7821.585s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But how do you set a tax rate on a deficit when you've already been here and you haven't even been programmed or been told?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7828.108s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is one thing this council has asked for over and over again on a monthly updated status report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7833.411s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you were traveling down this road and you knew there was going to be a deficit, you should have been told.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7838.993s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Not two weeks before Christmas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7841.114s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And to give the taxpayers once again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7843.237s">[Robert Penta]</a>: another Christmas surprise of taking money out of their surplus account that should be used, should be used only for water and stormwater drain construction here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=7854.405s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know how this city is operating lately, but all I can tell you is this, this is a radical change in what it used to be, and it's not going in the right direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AXh4iBqkQq0&t=1502.984s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Diolch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pK_zTCVRveY&t=3216.519s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of the Zagos party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pK_zTCVRveY&t=3220.922s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I, too, would like to commend this council for doing the right thing when this issue was presented before you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pK_zTCVRveY&t=3227.527s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And likewise, I'd like to thank Mark Rumley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pK_zTCVRveY&t=3230.409s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He's a city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pK_zTCVRveY&t=3232.393s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Councilor Umley, for doing the work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pK_zTCVRveY&t=3234.855s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the disturbing part about this whole presentation is the fact that the deed originally had its right of reverter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pK_zTCVRveY&t=3241.781s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the right of reverter reverts back to the community if, in fact, the building was not going to be used for the particular purpose for which it was intended, its non-profit use, and that would be helping children and adults that had serious problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pK_zTCVRveY&t=3256.71s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Putting that aside, the building sat there for almost two years and the city did nothing to recognize not only was the building not being used, but the fact of the matter is it wasn't being used for its intended purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pK_zTCVRveY&t=3268.494s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I just find it appalling that the mayor of this community would take it upon herself and send out a press release and not even thank you, the Councilors, because if it wasn't for you, the Councilors, asking Councilor Rumley to do the research, to prove and to show that that building did belong to the city,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pK_zTCVRveY&t=3286.41s">[Robert Penta]</a>: for a future particular city use, it's just a shame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pK_zTCVRveY&t=3291.114s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's another example of this lack of transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pK_zTCVRveY&t=3294.457s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I don't know what it's going to take for this council to wake up and to understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pK_zTCVRveY&t=3298.607s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You people are just being used, you're like a ping pong ball bouncing back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pK_zTCVRveY&t=3302.41s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Only when you need it, that's when you're called upon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pK_zTCVRveY&t=3305.052s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then when you finally do something, and it didn't even help any one Councilor in particular, you were doing this for the entire community, the community as a whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pK_zTCVRveY&t=3314.7s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you don't even get a special thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pK_zTCVRveY&t=3316.602s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't even get an acknowledgement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pK_zTCVRveY&t=3318.223s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't even get a reference by any commentary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pK_zTCVRveY&t=3320.925s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the mayor sends out a press release commending herself for completing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pK_zTCVRveY&t=3326.05s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a shame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pK_zTCVRveY&t=3327.011s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I don't know what it's going to take for this council to realize that you do have a voice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pK_zTCVRveY&t=3331.295s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You do are, you do, you are important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pK_zTCVRveY&t=3333.918s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And had not this council taken that seven to nothing vote to send it to Mr. Rumbling, but rather had the seven of you decided just to vote for it on that particular night, we wouldn't be where we are today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pK_zTCVRveY&t=3345.249s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And we'd be out of a building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pK_zTCVRveY&t=3346.79s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We'd be out of the use of the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pK_zTCVRveY&t=3349.05s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and you'd look like very stupid individuals because nobody did their homework.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pK_zTCVRveY&t=3353.311s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I thank you, I commend you, I applaud you, and I thank Mr. Rumley as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pK_zTCVRveY&t=3357.592s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pK_zTCVRveY&t=3358.692s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you, citizen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=157.352s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Petter, a former member of this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=159.603s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When I was reviewing the offering by Councilor Knight this evening, my question, I think, presents itself in a different direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=166.528s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, we've spent over $14.5 million for a brand new building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=170.552s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's obvious that certain departments are understaffed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=173.714s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this may be a good way to look at actually what is going on in the highway department as it relates to men, the equipment that they have, and everything that's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=183.382s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the fact that if this is going to be, I think, is your intent to create another department?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=188.245s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is that what you said, Councilor Knight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=190.153s">[Robert Penta]</a>: stand alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=190.773s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know if that's a contractual obligation that has to be negotiated through the union.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=194.534s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, it presents itself with a whole bunch of issues, but the best part of the issue I think is this, that I think the council really needs to take a look and see as to what's going on over there, the highway department or the public works building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=205.678s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, I don't really know if you have a director or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=207.598s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He was on a three months on trial basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=209.979s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It ended in March.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=210.879s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know if they're still advertising for a new director's position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=213.911s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I think it would be beneficial if he was here tonight to discuss the matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=224.759s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is that public knowledge that he's been?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=226.18s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, are you councillors aware of the fact that he's been appointed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=230.263s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Pardon me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=231.604s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, this is the problem of not getting information out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=235.788s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, some councillors know, some don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=237.749s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I, as a public person, don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=239.01s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I try to stay on top of what's going on here in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=241.836s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But more importantly, just getting back to this issue in particular, my suggestion would be, and if I was on your side of the rail, I would suggest that if we're going to be looking at this, maybe we should be looking at all the departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=252.561s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if this, in fact, is a union type of job, and this is contractual, I believe the membership themselves have to vote on this as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=260.205s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So while it sounds good, I just think it needs to be researched, and I think it's the best time to look at the whole offering in the Department of Public Works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1252.13s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1252.71s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1256.831s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm a member of the cyclist body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1258.531s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, one of the things that I think is a concerning point is while the meeting might be held tomorrow night, it's not really being held where the public can actually see it and view it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1267.133s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There are a lot of people who might like to come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1269.003s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and just can't do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1269.824s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1270.565s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We don't have any public access, so that's another two points against us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1274.929s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But more importantly, I think some of these proposed changes and discussions that take place stand to be corrected, go back to 2004 and then 2008.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1284.117s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And for them to be sitting in the committee for a long period of time such as that with no intent to either add or subtract to them or eliminate them,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1292.78s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In the being brought up now you know is of a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1296.423s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have some concerns in here relative toward open public forums and public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1304.648s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you read it the way it's being written unless the words are going to be changed someone's going to have to come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1311.467s">[Robert Penta]</a>: at six o'clock at night if they want to talk on the subject matter before the council, and then if they want to talk... Point of clarification, Mr. President, and this is why I'd rather not have this conversation now, because the paper still hasn't been presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1335.604s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Right, and that's why we're going to discuss this all tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1338.746s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But, Mr. President, with all due respect,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1340.458s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If this is the report that came out, an eight-page report, okay, and it's Councilor Longo-Curran and it's Councilor Marksley's alluded to, it would have been nice to have it highlighted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1348.041s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It did take some time to go review it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1350.382s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then why not discuss this right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1353.604s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What's being, what's wrong with, we're talking about highlights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1356.685s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's all we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1358.066s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And these are important points for people to maybe want to come tomorrow night and understand what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1403.784s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I believe, Mr. President, this was came out of committee in August.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1407.485s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is now October.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1408.946s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So there was a few months lag in between.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1411.767s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And now you're asking your honorable body to review this in a matter of a few days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1415.749s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Eight pages, very small, minuscule print.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1419.036s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But that's not the point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1419.957s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The fact of the matter is this involves the taxpayers of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1438.336s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're going to discuss this paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1442.398s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, that's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1443.18s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't think it's the Committee of the Whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1444.823s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's been referred to a Committee of the Whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1446.748s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And since you're referring something to the Committee of the Whole, are you telling me that all seven of you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1450.947s">[Robert Penta]</a>: are going to be afraid to discuss it before tomorrow night, to let the taxpayers know some of the issues that are on the agenda, Mr. President, that they might want to come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1460.549s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's on your agenda for tomorrow night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1471.271s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's the issue at point, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1474.852s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There are some very salient points here that operate against the taxpayer<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1479.713s">[Robert Penta]</a>: coming to this podium when they would like to speak on a subject matter more than once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1485.294s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Also suspension of the rules as an issue more than once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1489.035s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And we can go through this if you want to, page by page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1491.456s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's not my intent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1492.776s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My intent is to talk about some highlights that directly affect any taxpayer in this audience to come up here and have an opportunity to speak like right now, which a new rules is promulgated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1503.899s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They will not, if it's voted upon by this body, you won't be able to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1522.969s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, my remarks that I would like to wrap up, Mr. President, is the fact that on tomorrow night you're going to be discussing things that are going to restrict council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1531.154s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, citizen participation at this podium on more than one occasion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1534.896s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's done three deliberate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1536.863s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If the council so votes, there's going to be three opportunities where a citizens will not be able to do what's taking place here right now, coming up and speaking on something, whether it's on the agenda or suspension of the rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1548.838s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then the craziness of saying that the craziness of saying that is not wrap it up, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1554.045s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the craziness of saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1555.847s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that if one Councilor chastises another one, he has to be scolded by whoever the president is, and apologize, and he won't be able to speak until the apology takes place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1566.216s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What are we talking about here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1567.357s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is child's play.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1568.578s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is going to be discussed in the Committee of the Whole, sir.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1570.919s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, these are part of the rules that are being promulgated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1572.861s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1859.722s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1861.464s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Just a quick point of clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1863.625s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not on the city's website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1865.093s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And for the folks who have found out today, it was a citizen taxpayer who put it on a Facebook page, and that's how people became aware of it, because they couldn't get the gut of what this whole thing was about on the city's webpage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1878.26s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you, sir.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3699.245s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Hope to see you all there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4227.518s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4228.058s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4228.499s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Please state your name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4230.319s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Penta.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4231.279s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I live at zero summit road, former member of the Sargas party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4234.62s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Uh, let's take a reflect back on what council car viola just indicated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4237.82s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Uh, having served on the council with your folks before it was on a couple of occasions that he pressed for the issue regarding a report forthcoming forthcoming forthcoming regarding this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4248.413s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The last one that I seem to have that's available is dated December 4th of 2015, with a breakdown which does not include December of last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4258.335s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's a little bit perplexing as it relates to, number one, the citations that were appealed, which were something like 3,054 year-to-date, and the citations that were dismissed, which was 1,375.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4270.198s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So almost 45 percent of the citations that were issued up until November of last year were dismissed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4277.273s">[Robert Penta]</a>: but then you go to the issue regarding strike that hearings and year to date there was 240 hearings and of those year to date hearings, I think 88 of them were dismissed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4289.899s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The issue I think revolves around a whole host of contingencies on with this new pay to park, you can use your phone and what have you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4298.443s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Since there is a new owner out there, I have seen certain problems that have existed personally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4303.486s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yale Street parking lot, people in the lot after six o'clock at night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4306.905s">[Robert Penta]</a>: giving out tickets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4308.366s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Other parts of the city, the new people that have come on board with this new company, and I don't know who they are because you guys don't have a contract, you should have a copy of the contract as amended, should indicate that these folks should be aware as to what they're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4323.092s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Also, the fact that you can't go out there, these folks are supposed to be identified with a tag on them, with a face on their ID card, so to speak, and not something that's hidden behind their jacket or what have you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4337.282s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4338.743s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The other thing, and it's a concern, it's a bone of contention that I've had since day one, we were told during the last mayoral campaign by this mayor that seniors would be able to park for nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4348.208s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What you have now is if a senior wants to park in the city, that senior has to pay $25 to have the opportunity to park for nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4355.651s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They get a card or whatever it might be, and they can't transfer it to another car, because if you're a senior, and you happen to be 65, that's what they use for a standard, and 62 is social security age,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4366.73s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So why it's 65 to be a senior, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4369.572s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if you get this little placard or whatever it might be, or sticker, you can't transfer it to another car.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4374.336s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if you're a senior driving in the city and your car is either broken down and you wanna use another car, because you are a senior, you should be able to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4382.742s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the requirement doesn't go to the senior, apparently it goes to the car and you're stuck to that particular car.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4388.647s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think that really needs to be reviewed and looked upon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4391.389s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But more importantly, I just think the statistical analysis should be forthcoming<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4395.935s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You folks had asked for a monthly basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4397.956s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The last time you got it was eight months into the, nine months into the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4401.918s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It just doesn't seem right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4403.239s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My suggestion would be to have you have the new people, just like you had a Republic when they first come in, have them come and appear before the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4411.383s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Air your differences with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4412.684s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let them explain to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4414.144s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let them explain to the public what the changes might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4417.246s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, it's kind of hard, you know, when people call up and they ask, you know, what can we do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4421.328s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How do we make this thing better?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4424.009s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Lady comes to city hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4425.638s">[Robert Penta]</a>: thinking that she can pay her ticket here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4427.679s">[Robert Penta]</a>: She can't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4428.339s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And while she's here trying to pay the ticket, she's outside and she's getting a ticket on her car.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4432.64s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And she's coming in here thinking this is the way you're supposed to pay the ticket.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4435.541s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You go down the street to go to pay the ticket.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4437.701s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then, oh, too bad, you can't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4439.382s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've got a ticket.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4440.462s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You stayed here too long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4441.703s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's a whole host of issues that are still<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4443.572s">[Robert Penta]</a>: surrounding this whole thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4444.913s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're into the neighborhoods, where resident parking takes place, and late at night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4449.695s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These things are just multiplying, and nothing seems to be getting better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4452.716s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you speak to some of the business people in the square, in all the squares, they'll basically tell you that there are more spots open now than there were before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4460.119s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's great, but their business isn't getting any much better than it was before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4463.921s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If anything, it's getting less.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4465.942s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the only reprieve that was really given during this past year is when the mayor was in, Mayor McGlynn was here,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4471.825s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I guess he worked out a deal with Republic at that time, during the holidays, from November 4th to, I believe, January 3rd, that on the weekends, you didn't have to pay to use the meters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4481.27s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But that seems to be something that's not being worked out right now by this company.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4485.332s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know what they're going to do for the holidays this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4487.734s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a new company.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4488.454s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're new in town.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4489.635s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I strongly suggest that you have them before you, rather than having these piecemeal approaches of people with concerns and complaints, because you really need to take a look at the contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4499.08s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You really need to know what they're doing in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4501.717s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And Councilor Lungo-Koehn is right, asking for that because I think the time is near.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4505.818s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Your holidays are right around the corner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4512.64s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Any questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4513.44s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Be more than happy to answer them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4514.96s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4515.4s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Nice to see you all smiling tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4518.541s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11134.786s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Pentez, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11137.469s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm a member of the Saugus body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11139.455s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, during this past campaign for the mayor's office, the term that the president and mayor used was partners in progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11145.538s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And partners in progress doesn't seem to be the staple that took place during this particular budgetary season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11151.282s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As Councilor Lungo-Koehn has alluded to, if you only got three minutes of the mayor and the initial presentation of a budget, and then you had to fend for yourself after the fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11159.866s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think one of the comments, and I don't know what councilor made it, that many, many questions were asked more this year than ever before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11166.64s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This probably is a result of the answers worth forthcoming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11169.221s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's why you ask so many questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11171.402s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But a few of the things that I'd like to highlight, and this particular budget starts going back to a year ago, when this former budget was being presented by Louise Miller.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11180.146s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The question was asked of her twice, and it was by myself, when Mr. Scarpelli, Council Counsel Scott Scarpelli is sitting, would you present the budget in the same way it has been presented?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11188.83s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And she said no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11190.031s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And we went through the idea of presenting the budget that had<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11193.262s">[Robert Penta]</a>: a wish list of a cost analysis of each and every department had bringing forth that for which they wanted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11199.444s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now you didn't get it this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11200.645s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And unfortunately, why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11201.585s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know, because you have the same mayor who was the former budget director who relinquished that position to give it to Louise mill, who presented the budget, who indicated to you at that point in time that you would be getting hopefully a budget that would handle the request of the council that you didn't get.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11216.07s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I guess we're talking about old school and it just didn't come to fruition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11220.093s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So some of the things that I would be concerned about if I was still sitting on your side would be a new police station, something that you, Councilor De La Ruza, alluded to some three to four years ago as the number one priority of the Medford City Council, a brand new police station for the police officers of this city and for the safety and the concern of the citizens of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11238.74s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Absolutely no discussion about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11241.301s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was a bone of contention during this past campaign.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11244.182s">[Robert Penta]</a>: President's administration says it would be a minimum of seven years out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11247.667s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And we all know right now what's going on in that police station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11250.208s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, it's rat infested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11252.209s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It has mold in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11253.569s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It has police officers that are sick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11255.39s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it just cannot accommodate the everyday needs of a modern society, a police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11261.952s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, just a little real quick, when you talked about the box lunches for the workers on Election Day, it's interesting where the mayor found the money to have the mayor's office done completely over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11272.336s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But we can't find the money to take care, unfortunately, the people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11275.417s">[Robert Penta]</a>: who work on a daily basis, once a year or twice a year, depending on the primary and the final elections that take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11282.302s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, I think it's a service, minimal as it might be, that they deserve something having.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11287.165s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I haven't heard anybody talk about the fact that, I know there's approximately $20,000 in the budget that the mayor is required to put in, and she has to pay the entire cost of what you folks have hired an outside attorney to bring the 61 Locust Street issue to bear in hand, but nobody's talked about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11304.227s">[Robert Penta]</a>: which has been on the council agenda for many years, of looking at a new fire station on Riverside Avenue and possibly looking at a satellite fire station that sits on the opposite side of Wellington Station, where the station landing is, where the new development of 200 more units are going up, which are right opposite the Wellington Station, plus the whole commercial industrial area over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11325.943s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think that's something that really needs to be addressed, over and beyond the fact that if you look at your budget,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11331.445s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In this year's budget, your fire department overtime money was there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11336.788s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But once again, on the annual basis, on the police department side, their overtime money wasn't there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11341.992s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It has to be transferred each and every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11344.573s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now that's a serious question to ask, because they range anywhere from $400,000 to $600,000 a year in overtime, where the fire department has their money in overtime built right in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11354.68s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why that happens in the police department, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11357.141s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if you want a true and accurate accounting of what overtime costs,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11360.169s">[Robert Penta]</a>: or projected overtime costs, that money should be definitive right in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11365.53s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Also, you built a new $14.1 million Department of Public Works building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11370.391s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's understaffed, and you don't have the right equipment to do all the jobs that are necessary on a daily basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11375.852s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Right now, you're dealing with an interim temporary supervisor, a director of the building over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11382.574s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I just don't know where it's going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11384.474s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And a lot of this click it, fix it idea of what are being asked to be fixed,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11389.217s">[Robert Penta]</a>: are being mocked off as being completed, and they haven't even been addressed, they haven't even been resolved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11393.758s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And why these things are being resolved through the Department of Public Works, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11397.76s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If somebody's making a mistake or it's an error, for whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11402.101s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Also, you talked about, Councilman Marks, you also alluded to the fact that $400,000 from the water and sewer on the school department and the city side is basically borne by the taxpayers of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11412.804s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, it's an interesting analysis because many years ago, when we were talking about the new INI that was coming in,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11418.88s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and we were doing High Street, and the MWRA was in here putting in new water lines, especially at the intersection of Governor's Avenue and High Street, there was a project cost in that particular area of quite a few dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11433.064s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I forget the exact amount, so I won't lead it to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11435.785s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But part of the mitigation that took place as a result of that is they had to do High Street, I believe from Medford Square, a little bit past CVS,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11444.865s">[Robert Penta]</a>: to do that street over as part of the mitigation for the cost of putting these two things in there, relining the street and making the connections right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11453.472s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As a matter of fact, I think it was right out in front of Carlings where the sewer just fell into the ground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11458.356s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think a lady got hurt, and that was precipitous of what took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11462.539s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the $400,000 is just a drop in the bucket to the $8.5 million that's presently sitting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11467.767s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and the water and sewer account, you know, and what major projects do you have lined up where those monies can be expended?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11475.011s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, I didn't hear it, I didn't see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11476.631s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think last week there was a conversation with some folks on looking at cities and, I mean, streets to be done, and I believe Evans Street was one of them that they were talking about, and I believe the comment was that we'll be getting to the water and sewer portion of it, but we probably won't get to the paving of it until next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11493.62s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I just hope that this council is not getting buffaloed<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11496.114s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and to passing a budget that's not taking an understanding into what streets are going to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11501.258s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then all of a sudden next year, in election year, all these streets decided to get done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11505.48s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And a major cost is going to come out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11507.582s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And maybe this is what this whole capital improvement program is going to be all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11510.984s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11511.825s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But it's not fair for the people who have been waiting year in and year out, waiting for their street to be done, waiting for their manholes on their street to be fixed, waiting for their sidewalks to be taken care of, waiting for their tree stumps to be removed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11524.41s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the number that you were given a few weeks ago is absolutely wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11527.212s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's many more than two to three to 400 tree stumps that are out there that need to be corrected and taken care of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11533.036s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You also, um, and in the last election, we talked about the CPA, whether you were for it or against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11540.3s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And here you are in June, almost seven months later, and there's still no definitive program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11545.664s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There is still nothing out there to tell the people what that money is going to be used for and when it's going to be used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11550.654s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you look at the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, they don't even know if they're going to be able to fund it this year, because they're behind on revenues and revenue projections that they had anticipated coming in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11559.9s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the people of this community have to have an understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11562.261s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you voted for the CPA for the 1.5%, I believe that's what they voted for, as the override on your taxes, over and beyond your taxes, which to me is an end run of Proposition 2.5, but that's nearly over there, you're still going to be funding the whole thing on your own.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11575.45s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you're not going to be getting that for which you thought the match was going to be from the state, because they just don't have the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11580.57s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And unfortunately, you're stuck with it for five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11583.251s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I think I believe that it's in Councilor Knight's committee that you're working on, the ad hoc committee, and waiting to make a finality of where it's going to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11594.813s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And hopefully, the recommendation will come out, and people will have an opportunity to discuss it, and you can get a feeling of where you're going to be going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11604.855s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's been absolutely no upgrading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11606.905s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On the antiquated cable casting of this council chamber, what transmits over cable television, whether it be Comcast or Verizon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11614.688s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Verizon seems to have a better signal going out rather than Comcast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11618.229s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This building hasn't been touched for well over 30 years, and I would suggest that you do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11622.45s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then you have an excess of the cable access money, an excess of $550,000 just sitting there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11629.913s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's never been done, and it's never been done to be used to correct this particular building over here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11637.118s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's a whole bunch of things that you folks have been getting into.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11640.44s">[Robert Penta]</a>: One of the things I want to compliment the council on, and you took the bull by the horns for the last couple of weeks, is the Locust Street project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11648.066s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's 61 Locust Street, 490 unit project on Locust Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11651.929s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I compliment you publicly because it really is an issue that is disturbing to the neighborhood and it'll destroy the entire fabric, not only of the Wellington neighborhood, it has an immediate impact on the entire city of Medford, if in fact that were to come to fruition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11665.688s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Without going through all the particulars and all the facts that are relegated to it, I thank you for taking that position and voting seven to nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11672.694s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Very rare do you get seven to nothing vote on something like this, but you did the right thing on this particular- You have one minute, sir.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11677.499s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Pardon me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11678.76s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You did the right thing as it relates to this particular subject matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11683.624s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I just want to conclude probably by saying that I would hope you have a new budget director coming on board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11692.131s">[Robert Penta]</a>: has been here for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11693.432s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I happen to like Anne, and I think she does a good job, and I think she's a very honest person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11697.334s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I think she was put in a very tough situation as it relates to presenting not only the budget before you folks, but before the Medford City Council and city government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11705.919s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I thank you for your efforts, Anne.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11708.28s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But more importantly, I would just hope this council gets its act together by demanding from this mayor that before any budget comes forward, before any capital improvement comes forward, she sits down with you personally, not an emissary,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11720.43s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When in fact, she did have a representative who was supposed to be your council emissary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11724.171s">[Robert Penta]</a>: She's not here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11725.451s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're never here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11726.171s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Unfortunately, you have to do this on your own and vote on it on your own.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11729.732s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So once again, I thank you for listening to my comments and at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11745.916s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11747.136s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I just want to thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11748.417s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11749.317s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Without calling you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3901.807s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Penter, I live at Zero Summit Road, former member of the Sarkis party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3905.929s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I want to thank Mr. Reid for coming forward here, because I think he's bringing to the attention of our public the fact that our streets and the needs of our streets, whether they be sidewalks, whether they be curbings, whether they be the underground infrastructure, is in a desperate need of, how can you say, a revisiting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3923.537s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You folks haven't seen this, and not to digress, but I will digress, going back to last year during the campaign, this was a big issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3930.461s">[Robert Penta]</a>: People in this community are very concerned about their streets, the potholes in their streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3935.645s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The people are not getting any response back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3938.507s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, the city now signs on to this quote, unquote, complete streets program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3944.311s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Do a street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3945.372s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Get a street done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3946.793s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Don't get it to the point that it is right now that people are coming up here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3950.696s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I know there's going to be another gentleman that's going to come up here and he's going to talk about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3954.697s">[Robert Penta]</a>: a street that the city owns that they haven't done that was part of a $14.4 million project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3960.058s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it just doesn't make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3962.139s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, the council has asked, and you, acting president Marks, you would ask for an annual monthly go along to see where the budget's going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3972.301s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think last year Louise Miller said, she said it twice, right here at this podium, she would have never presented the budget the way it's been, as it's been in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3980.434s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and she would put your wish list in there, and she would show the cost and where and how it would go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3985.136s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, I think you folks do have an obligation as city councilors, because I know I accepted it when I sat on that side of the rail, to have monthly meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3992.679s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So have meetings with your department heads to find out exactly what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3997.181s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The rumor around this building that the city engineer, she's on a six-month to a one-year review for her job performance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4003.624s">[Robert Penta]</a>: True or false or indifferent, I don't know, but that's the rumor running around the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4007.779s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But whether it's a rumor or not, the fact of the matter is this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4011.204s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The streets in this city are in desperate need of not only repair, but a review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4015.75s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The public works department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4019.216s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Their short chains would help, but at the same time, their direction is not being geared into the purpose of what it's there for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4026.121s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What's the most important thing that's affecting this community right now on a daily basis?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4031.365s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All of a sudden, they just got through painting the stripes, the crosswalks and the stripes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4036.428s">[Robert Penta]</a>: School is out and the stripes are done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4038.25s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This should have been done when school was in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4040.771s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Prime time of the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4041.772s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It used to be done twice a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4042.973s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It used to cost $60,000 a year when Mayor McGlynn was here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4046.215s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now he's only been out a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4047.156s">[Robert Penta]</a>: $60,000 a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4048.92s">[Robert Penta]</a>: paint the crosswalks and the stripes, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4051.184s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Twice a year, it's a public safety issue, why not?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4053.87s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But look at your streets, look at your sidewalks, look at your curbing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4057.757s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. Reed brought, I think, some excellent points forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4061.178s">[Robert Penta]</a>: not to sit here and advocate for him to be an employee of the city, but he did work for this city, and he did do a good job, and he did bring these attentions to the engineering department, and we're still talking about him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4071.601s">[Robert Penta]</a>: After the fact, still talking about him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4074.102s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's just symptomatic on how this entire administration operates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4077.864s">[Robert Penta]</a>: After the fact, no public acknowledgement, and this council, you know, I don't know what this mayor thinks of this council, but it's quite obvious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4085.508s">[Robert Penta]</a>: She doesn't have you in high regards at all, because you folks have absolutely no idea as to what's going on outside this building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4092.474s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You do the best you can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4093.755s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You read it in the newspaper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4094.956s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You talk amongst yourselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4096.963s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But unfortunately, if this city keeps going in the direction it's going, it'll have no direction to go in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4101.745s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's going to be out of control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4103.426s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it is out of control right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4105.287s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Locust Street is the best example of telling you what's happening in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4109.569s">[Robert Penta]</a>: An out-of-control situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4111.43s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Just think of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4112.25s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You folks had to go hire your own attorney to sue the Board of Appeals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4116.352s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and for which this mayor thought this was a great project here in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4119.695s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's going to add a wonderful new neighborhood and we're excited about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4124.038s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We are so excited about it, it's going to cost you hundreds and thousands of dollars because now the council is going to sue your board of appeals that your city solicitor has to defend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4132.986s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the neighbors have to go out and get their lawyer for they have to pay for it because they're not going to get pushed around by city hall who never asked them to be part of it or to be included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4142.393s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's like a bad street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4144.074s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you don't fix it, it gets worse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4146.595s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, it's the public relations of this administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4149.496s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's worse now than it was when it started, and it's not getting any better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4153.097s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I would hope that this Medford City Council puts its foot down and tells this mayor that before you do anything and go forward, we want to be a part of it, and our city streets, we want to be a part of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4164.581s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4669.494s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Penter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4670.615s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I live at zero summit road, former member of this August party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4674.176s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, we're not a city that's rising from the ashes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4678.395s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There hasn't been a catastrophe in this city, and we shouldn't be looked upon as a community that the Trojan horses come in, which is development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4686.601s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And development, just for the sake of development, doesn't mean it's always good for this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4691.524s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When that decision was rendered this morning, I took all afternoon to review it, page by page, word by word.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4698.248s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Fourteen pages of a hastily written decision because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4702.523s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The board, I believe, did not want to hear what this Medford City Council wanted to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4707.264s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the city solicitor is absolutely right, because I've checked the cases and other cases that reflect upon the fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4712.946s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You folks, you are the master of the zoning of this city of Medford, not the board of appeals, because that's what they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4719.607s">[Robert Penta]</a>: People go to them on an appeal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4721.008s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you folks, you write the zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4724.048s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The zoning begins and ends here, goes through whatever the process might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4728.549s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you have every right to not only appeal this decision,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4731.632s">[Robert Penta]</a>: but to appeal it as loudly and as strongly as you can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4735.273s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On page five of the decision, the commentary says it completes the zoning, the industrial zoning, except for heightened use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4745.116s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, this is an industrial piece of property, which is allowed to have certain exemptions that you don't have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4752.017s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the heightened use relegates itself to the multiple dwelling portion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4758.48s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We can go back to 1988.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4759.381s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There was a company called Asano and White.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4762.023s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They did a, I think it was a $70,000, $80,000 report here in the city of Medford as it reflects upon housing, development, traffic impact, and water and sewer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4772.57s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the Wellington Glenwood area was one of the particular areas that they did it on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4777.674s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And Councilman Marks alluded to the fact on page eight, the topography of the land.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4781.937s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The board says that a substantial part of the property, if it's not developed with multiple dwelling,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4789.03s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In the ordinance, the industrial zone, in essence, will become inoperative because it'll just stay industrial and you can't do anything with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4796.497s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think there's one point that hasn't been said thus far, unless somebody else wants to say it later on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4801.242s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Don't forget, when these folks came on March 31st and before that, they didn't say no to the development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4806.226s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They were conciliatory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4807.828s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They said, reduce the size of the project, make it smaller if you can, and I think the people could live with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4814.117s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But that didn't take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4815.757s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you read the decision regarding 7 Canal Street, the very last paragraph, as written by the board, basically says, and I read it, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4827.879s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's kind of interesting, that decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4829.94s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It says the following, in conclusion, the board is hopeful that the developer will reconsider the size and scope of the proposed apartment building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4838.161s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There is much to commend the overall project in such close proximity to public transportation<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4843.469s">[Robert Penta]</a>: including the commuter rail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4845.59s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, in that decision, they talked about the abutters that showed up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4849.532s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In this 14-page decision, there's nothing about an abutter that showed up, nothing about the concerns that they had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4855.714s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All they talked about was the fact that this is going to be great for that particular area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4860.296s">[Robert Penta]</a>: April 27th of this year, Mayor Burke of this community said this is a great project to develop a new neighborhood in this part of town.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4866.939s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're excited about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4868.725s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But where is the transparency, the open public meeting on zoning of this nature?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4873.447s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because you folks have never had a development this large smack you in the face.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4877.828s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And since you've all been here, you've never had an audience like this who are so upset over the fact that they weren't a part of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4883.51s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're coming in after the fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4885.01s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They should have been here before the fact, before this honorable body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4888.391s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You folks wrote the law, and you should be well aware of what's going on upstairs in that Board of Appeals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4901.968s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, in the decision, it's relegated to the terms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4908.155s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They state the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4910.358s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We respect the fact that this zoning and site plan review fits the standards of this particular project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4922.39s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is the wording of the zoning and the site plan review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4925.112s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The purpose of our zoning is to promote the health, safety, morals, convenience, and to lessen the danger from congestion and confusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4933.198s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Site plan review states the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4935.28s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The purpose of this article is to promote development, which is harmonious with surrounding areas and adequate consideration of abutting land owners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4944.247s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, we have abutting land owners here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4947.149s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where were their concerns is written in this document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4949.791s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's nowhere to be found.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4951.418s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if it's nowhere to be found here, it's quite obvious that they didn't take it into consideration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4955.68s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And Councilman Marks, again, alluded to the fact that we relied on department head reports, and we relied on their reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4963.064s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Kind of interesting, the folks that, Vanessa Hagan, who was the consultant they had for the traffic study, is the same one that they had for Canal Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4971.748s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that was only four stories high and for 30 units.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4975.612s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is 490 units high, 490 units and five stories high.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4981.838s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Big difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4982.939s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But let's get to the bottom line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4983.941s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What are you going to have here for the bottom line?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4985.402s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because it's the impact that's going to affect the neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4988.185s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is what you're going to have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4989.146s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're going to have coal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4990.027s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If everybody's online and all the developments are coming on board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4993.617s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You'll have Coles, you'll have Marshalls, you'll have Wegmans, you'll have Lumineer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4997.338s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They just sold their building after one year for $66.6 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5003.841s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What makes you think these people may not do the same thing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5006.101s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5006.442s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Hi, Hawaii.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5007.042s">[Robert Penta]</a>: See you later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5007.782s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Make a fast buck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5008.702s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Who pays for it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5009.463s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5010.542s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then you're going to have the skating rink over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5012.284s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then you're going to have the 490 units.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5013.946s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then you're going to have eight commercial businesses, three apartment buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5017.33s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And now let's take a ride down Locust Street and bang a left and go to Wellington Circle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5022.096s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're going to have 200 more units of apartment housing going over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5025.82s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And don't forget the casino when that opens up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5027.882s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You put this all together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5029.544s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you take Little Locust Street, which is a two-way street, it's going to make no sense at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5034.227s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If this administration had any brains, they would have called you into that office over there, sat down with you and said, what do you think, guys?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5040.452s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is what I think I'd like to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5042.173s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Can we add or subtract to it and come up with a unified front?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5045.555s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, you have an administration that just goes on their own way and now you're here to pick up the slack.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5050.861s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what's the slack?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5051.882s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're going to have to take money and appeal it on behalf of the taxpayers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5055.606s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I would expect you folks, do appeal it and do spend that money and send the message back to that office over there that you guys and gals are not patsies for someone else's administration when you're not even brought in and consulted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5067.718s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There is no transparency to what's going on in this city right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5070.94s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this is the perfect example when you look at a development such as this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5074.681s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This should never be happened without your consideration and consultation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5089.709s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, we get elected for one reason, or I got elected for one reason when I was on that side of the rail, to do the people's business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5096.783s">[Robert Penta]</a>: not to sit here and wonder what I'm supposed to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5099.506s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you're brand new, it's a learning process, then you better learn real quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5102.669s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because you know what you're dealing with?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5103.69s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're dealing with the taxpayers' money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5105.231s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're dealing with their direction in how this city is supposed to go forward, whether it's on the school department side when you take that final vote, or whether it's on the city side when you're putting all your money together to find out in what direction are we going to be able to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5117.223s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, you have a budget coming up right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5119.98s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And in this particular budget, as the councilor, Mr. Rumley alluded to, you should make the request tonight to put a minimum of $50,000 in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5127.604s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I'm going to tell you the reason why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5129.865s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A few years ago, when I was on this city council, we had a decision to be made regarding Tufts University on a piece of land that they wanted to take and they wanted to use it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5140.19s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it was Foley, Holg, Elliott and Boston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5143.492s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it was a hundred thousand dollars would cost the city, but the city won its case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5147.994s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5148.63s">[Robert Penta]</a>: because the council was determined when they took that vote that we weren't going to get pushed around and we weren't going to have the Dover Amendment used against us because it was inappropriate at that particular time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5157.916s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it was 1991 or whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5161.202s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you've got to be realistic about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5162.822s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've got to move ASAP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5164.243s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Plus another thing, Mr. Rumley, you can correct me if I'm wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5166.903s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you guys and girls are going to come on board and appeal this case, you can ask for an extension of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5171.464s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Same thing that the visiting nurses did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5173.224s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe they got a six-month extension of time when the taxpayers decided or the abutters decided to appeal this particular case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5185.406s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In 1985, I made an offer of a resolution before this Method City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5189.427s">[Robert Penta]</a>: None of you were on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5190.872s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's why I'm still here, because I remember these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5193.378s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I got a bag full of tricks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5194.8s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that tells me what to remember every single time, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5198.461s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I made a resolution to put a moratorium on building and construction in the city of Medford because at that point in time, you had high-rise condominiums going up with no rhyme and no reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5208.125s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you didn't take a look and see where you wanted your city to go and the traffic impact it would have, the social impact, the educational impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5217.348s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the educational impact, you would have no idea where you're going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5220.609s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then again in 2005, I filed the same resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5224.368s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Miffitt City Council in both times approved it, and both times the city administration did not want to embark upon it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5230.51s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, it sounds nice to say, if this development takes place, I think we're going to get, here it goes, we're going to get approximately $1.5 million in building permits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5241.175s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're going to get approximately $2 million in linkage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5243.615s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're going to get approximately $1.375,000 in tax money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5250.606s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, money just for the sake of money should not make this city drive itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5255.243s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know what should drive this community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5257.103s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The heart of every single person in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5259.344s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How you can get along, how you can live together, how your streets can be compatible, how your schools, your churches, and your neighbors can be compatible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5266.846s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Not to have a group of people come in here tonight, frustrated over the fact this is after the fact, and now you're picking up the ball and going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5275.488s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This should not be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5276.868s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They should be coming here tonight congratulating you because you stopped it early on and it came before you at an appropriate time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5283.79s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I hope this is a warning, Mr. President, and all members of the council, that you go forward, hire the attorney, and I'm quite sure that you will win.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5291.771s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5292.592s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11022.879s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11025.561s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On that question to Councilor Falco you just asked, I believe it would be discriminatory on the man's part because right now, as the city solicitor just alluded to, he's representing the Board of Appeals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11035.489s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Under normal circumstances, correct me if I'm wrong,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11037.941s">[Robert Penta]</a>: you would be the legal counsel for the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11040.502s">[Robert Penta]</a>: With that being said, that leaves you without any legal representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11044.483s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you, by right and by law, are entitled to have legal representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11048.204s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My suggestion would be that you would ask for $20,000, put it into the budget, and you could take it from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11053.886s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because I don't think you're going to get out of this thing any cheaper than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11056.427s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You need a starting figure to start off with, and I would keep it at $20,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11059.968s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And lastly, I just want to say, I want to thank you for continuously being so rude, Mr. Delarusso, because I really<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3734.503s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Penter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3735.504s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I live at zero summit road, Medford mass, a former member of this August body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3739.908s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Uh, to get to council night's question brought up at the council, at the, uh, appeals meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3743.911s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's an industrially zoned piece of property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3746.193s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Number one, and it's 490 units that are being asked over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3750.436s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There are 11 variances that were being presented, 11 variances more than any other time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3755.3s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I believe all 11 of them were asking for relief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3758.37s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And according to the preliminary decision, they've been granted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3761.553s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's an awful lot of variances on a one single piece of property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3766.238s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think folks really need to understand something, that that night on that, it was an extremely hard night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3771.903s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the residents that were there, they waited all night long to make sure that their comments were made, while the developer took as much time as needed, and rightfully so, to present their position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3781.772s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But there were some comments that some folks still wanted to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3784.433s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Unfortunately, at the very end, they weren't allowed to because I don't know if it was because of the time or for whatever the reasons might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3791.296s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But there are two sites and sections of our own municipal laws that need to be reviewed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3796.398s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's Chapter 94, Section 1, which is our zoning ordinance, which says that the change cannot cause congestion or confusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3804.101s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And also under our site plan review under Section 94, Section 33.1,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3811.439s">[Robert Penta]</a>: excuse me, section 331, it states that the community, the neighborhood has to be taken into consideration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3817.166s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is it compatible with the neighborhood as it relates to this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3820.81s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, just think of the traffic on the traffic issue alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3824.989s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're going to start off with the new Lumineers, which is 160 units.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3829.23s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then you have the ice skating rink.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3831.131s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then you have across the street, you have Coles and Marshalls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3833.352s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then you're going to have the new Wegmans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3835.092s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then you're going to have 490 units if that goes through, 7,000 square feet of office space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3840.174s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then you're going to have, going down the street a little bit further, two office buildings, and I think there's six remaining commercial pieces of property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3847.996s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Take that and then go to Wellington Circle, where 200 more units of affordable housing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3854.335s">[Robert Penta]</a>: are going to be taking place and coming on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3857.417s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now just imagine in the middle of the day, 8, 9, 10, weekends, night times, whatever it might be, taking into consideration once the new casino comes in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3867.602s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have Riverside Avenue, you have Locust Street, Mystic Valley Parkway, Harvard Street, and all the side streets that spin off of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3875.766s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Do you realize how much traffic that that's going to cause?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3879.308s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And for them to say it has no traffic input makes absolutely no sense at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3883.785s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would respectfully ask whoever made that request for next Tuesday night to ask how they made that determination of no traffic input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3892.387s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because the developer himself acknowledged that on an annual basis, at a minimum of 1%, traffic will increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3898.808s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And they acknowledged by their own development that traffic will increase in that particular area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3903.689s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But to get back to what you were talking about, smart growth, Councilor Falco.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3907.21s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Some years ago, I made an offering regarding growth and development here in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3911.612s">[Robert Penta]</a>: for which we didn't have any review with the prior administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3914.914s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We asked for a moratorium for which at that point in time the council was in favor of, but the city's administration never went forward with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3921.878s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have no development that takes place in any part of this city that can tell you it's going to work, whether it be smart or not, whether it be compatible or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3932.784s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This development that's taking place down there off of Riverside Avenue in the Wellington area has an environmental impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3940.022s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It has a community impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3942.163s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It has a neighborhood impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3944.424s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And when you look at the development that's taking place by this developer wanting 490 units and a full packed room of residents that were there, and you go back a month prior to, and you look at the 40 units to a four-story building in West Medford that didn't have anywhere near the amount of complete neighborhood support for not wanting the project, how can you say one gets supported and one doesn't?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3970.421s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That doesn't fit well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3971.502s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It doesn't bode well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3972.342s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I'm glad that the majority of almost every one of you councilors are on board for not only having the meeting, but to having open public dialogue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3978.666s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And Councilor Lungo-Koehn is correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3980.527s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Some years ago when they were doing the 9th Street project, because it was such a large particular project, at that point in time the council asked, and the developer agreed, they came before the council, committee of the whole, and then before the council, and we had a complete community meeting on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3995.075s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Talked about what units were going to be affordable, which ones weren't going to be affordable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3999.721s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it really needs to be understood, and I think Jeannie Martin, you said it right in the beginning, small-scale residential neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4009.587s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Even if it's one person that's impacted, that's one too many.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4012.569s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And when you get the administration, and this President Mayer and her administration, making the comment on April 27th, as reported in the paper,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4019.912s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that this is a great place to develop a new neighborhood and we're excited about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4024.376s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How can you be excited about it when the neighborhood itself wasn't even aware of it, didn't even have an opportunity to come and speak?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4030.24s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, maybe the Board of Appeals offered their opportunity for the public hearing and never got here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4035.42s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're right when you're saying that your zoning should be reviewed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4038.241s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It should be reviewed only because of the fact you don't want to keep going through things of this nature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4042.643s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is a huge development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4044.765s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This isn't singular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4045.805s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is coupled upon that for which is already there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4049.247s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that for which is already there will totally decimate that particular neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4054.009s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This isn't even a three or a four-way road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4055.89s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is a two-way road going in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4058.231s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And just imagine all the stores that I just mentioned, Coles, Marshall, Wegmans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4063.149s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Luminaires, the ice skating rink, 490 units, 7,000 square feet of office space, two apartment buildings, and seven other, you know, public, other commercial pieces of property at any one point in time, at any one day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4074.136s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What do you think's gonna happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4075.977s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Councilman Marks is right when he talks about what the three new stores that opened up on Riverside Avenue, on any one given night or weekend, or especially on holidays or shopping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4084.803s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You need not only smart development, you need a stop and look to see where this city is going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4091.427s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Just development for the sake of development doesn't mean anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4095.189s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you want to have something that reaches the niche of every single person, whether it be senior citizen housing, whether it be more medical space, whether it be more space for your education, or whatever it might be, I don't know if it's going to take $250,000, but I know this, you would want a complete community interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4114.818s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, we don't have to be like some of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4117.45s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But we can beg, borrow, and steal like Somerville does in a smaller way in smaller sections of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4123.173s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And let us not forget one important thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4125.634s">[Robert Penta]</a>: At that meeting last Tuesday night, the neighborhood was most conciliatory by saying it wasn't that they were against the project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4133.698s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was way too large, didn't fit the neighborhood, and they were willing for something that would be much more reduced, that would be more compatible, and at least people could live with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4142.664s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's all that they're looking for, something that they can live with, not something that's going to be thrown down their throat because they didn't have an opportunity for input, but more importantly, just because the city's going to garner approximately $2 million in taxes and approximately $1.6 million in linkage fees, this administration's looking at the money and they're cutting the beans as fast as they can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4163.281s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And who's going to pay for it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4164.783s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The neighborhood's going to pay for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4166.785s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The people who have been there, who have taken care of their property for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4170.33s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All the side streets off of Riverside Avenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4172.632s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Try to get off of Harvard Street now in the morning, add this to the congestion, and wait until Wellington Circle takes place and the 200 units over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4180.001s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is everybody going to have a car?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4181.202s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Absolutely not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4182.183s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But even if it's 10% more on that road, it's 10% more that it can't handle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4186.826s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have a police department that's in desperate need of help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4189.548s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have a school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4190.669s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We don't know if it's getting maxed out because of these units.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4193.231s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have a fire department that's stretched.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4194.792s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We don't even know because the administration won't let them do a trial run into Wellington Circle to make sure we have a satellite fire station or a police station there for which the prior administration looked into but never did anything about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4207.642s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have so many issues that are confronting you here, and to have the Board of Appeals just vote preliminarily to go forward and grant the easement, it's only going to satisfy those money-hungry developers coming in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4219.948s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Look at Lumineers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4221.169s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're not even in there a year, and they sold out for $66.6 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4225.731s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Think about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4226.712s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Who's to say this company won't do the same thing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4229.413s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But there's one thing that you can't sell out, and that's the integrity and the brains of the people that live in the neighborhood, because they know what's right<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4237.755s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They know what's good for them, and they're paying their taxes, and I'm quite sure they don't want their taxes paid for something like this, which is going to absolutely make their neighborhood a deplorable place to live.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4249.319s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10740.297s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, Madam President, my name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10748.341s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10749.482s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10750.397s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I can appreciate the idea that Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10752.458s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Hunt and the Energy Office has brought before the council, but I don't think her tenure here has been long enough to understand what the citizens of our community have expected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10761.563s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We can digress and go back a few years and talk about Stations Landing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10765.024s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When Stations Landing was coming here into the city of Medford, people, or we were told, that that would be the new panacea of no new growth in this community or a stability in growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10775.71s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And we've all seen what's happened since that point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10778.333s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The taxes have gone up each and every year while we've collected well in excess of a million and a half new dollars each and every year from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10785.395s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, the next argument could possibly be the banks here in the City of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10789.757s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The City of Medford goes out on a daily basis to get the best possible rate on interest rates for the money that they deposit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10797.88s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is the City of Medford going to go out of its way now to tell the taxpayers of this community to go to a particular bank that they go to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10805.222s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the more people that go to that bank, they're going to get a better interest rate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10808.863s">[Robert Penta]</a>: because we're getting a good interest rate, which is better than the bank that you're going to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10813.644s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Same thing with the insurance company.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10815.525s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have to buy our insurance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10816.685s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We go out and we get the best bid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10818.345s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The best bid will probably be less than the bid that you, Mr. and Mrs. Medford, possibly might be getting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10823.647s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10824.747s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But Mr. Champ, you just brought up a very interesting point when you talked about water and sewer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10829.448s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You folks have in your budget right now in excess of a $400,000 deficit or a debt on the water<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10836.389s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and the suicide from the city and the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10839.331s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why isn't the city paying for that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10841.272s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But right now, they're so concerned about your electric bill, but they're not concerned about the $400,000 that every single taxpayer in this city is paying for because the school department in the city side won't account for their own water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10854.682s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And hopefully, you people will pass that when the budget comes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10858.284s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, you talk about the state legislature passing these laws, and I think you're right, Councilman Marks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10862.307s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think they got this upside down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10864.682s">[Robert Penta]</a>: opting in rather than opting out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10867.082s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The best way a community or a city can operate, when they talk to their taxpayers, when they have better communication, but when they don't have good communication, and the only public forum that they have is this council, and the rail here at this council that they can come up and talk, then that's what the conversation should be about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10885.769s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You shouldn't be talking about taking a vote which mandates somebody that they have to join, and then they might have to figure out when, within 180 days, have to opt out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10895.953s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's not the right way to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10897.634s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if we're going to expend municipal time through its employees on projects on behalf of every single taxpayer in this community, then why are you mandating it rather than making it voluntarily so you could show them this is a better way for you, Mr. and Mrs. Medford, to save money rather than be at the option of April or October to a $100,000 consultant<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10922.712s">[Robert Penta]</a>: who was going to be making money trying to tell the city of Medford who might, on a particular day, get the best possible rate, and who might not get that best possible rate during that period of time, but the consultant still makes his money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10935.556s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't think this is a good idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10937.297s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think there are more important things to do here in the city of Medford, and I would hope that this Medford City Council does not entertain this particular matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10944.82s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2758.648s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Pente.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2759.568s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I live at Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2761.809s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm a member of the Zagos Party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2763.729s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, this isn't the first time we're talking about police safety and security here within this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2768.151s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I can remember Councilor De La Ruza when you first came on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2770.392s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think one of the priorities in this council was the police department in a public safety building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2775.393s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And we're here so many years later after the fact under a new administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2779.474s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you really want to have public safety be a real major concern, a major issue here within this council,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2785.05s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have a budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2785.75s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it was you, Councilor Falco, who said early on that you would like the budget process to be informed a little bit early.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2791.473s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's something that we've all asked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2792.854s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Councilor Marks, you just alluded to having a wish list for which we don't have, we haven't seen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2797.897s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You are now coming into almost the end of May, and you have yet to have a budget presented before you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2802.899s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Surrounding cities and towns are already discussing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2806.161s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If this council is really serious about public safety, they would hold the budget up, demand from the mayor, not only a time schedule,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2814.275s">[Robert Penta]</a>: but the financial wherewithal to put a new police department together and to hire more police officers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2819.476s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think once that takes place, this administration knows that this Medford City Council is serious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2824.738s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you're not just talking about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2826.338s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're not just referring to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2827.959s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You mean business this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2830.179s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We just had a very tragedy this past week with Officer Tarantino.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2833.84s">[Robert Penta]</a>: His father was a Medford police officer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2836.321s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This isn't a matter of whether black lives matter, white lives matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2841.203s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's every life matters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2842.999s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's what people have to understand when they look at a police officer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2845.661s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're there each and every single day, just like a fireman, in the public safety realm of this community, to take care of the people that they were, how can you say, that they were charged to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2858.19s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And they don't do it asking for any recompense or any notoriety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2862.073s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's their job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2864.094s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, let's give them a break this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2866.516s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Councilman Marks, you alluded to $8 million sitting in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2870.759s">[Robert Penta]</a>: City of Marlin, a perfect example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2873.104s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They got $8 million, and they also got $8 million in grants toward a new police station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2878.128s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We haven't even delved into this matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2881.19s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You folks haven't even been called into a roundtable meeting with this administration to talk about this, not only as a priority, but as a necessary demand to keep our city safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2892.499s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If we don't have folks like Ian Fratz or Jeanne Martin coming up, and sometimes they may say, hey, they're a pain in the neck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2897.992s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you might even think that I'm a pain in the neck, but you know something?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2900.653s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't mind being the pain in the neck, because this is my community, and I love it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2904.195s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I served on this board for 36 years, and I have yet to see the Medford Police Department get what they really need, not only in more men and a new building, but a sense of priority here in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2915.961s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And when I compare that and I look and see the nonsense that's going on in the school department, praising the superintendent for whatever he's doing, which can't even compare to what the Smithford Police Department and the Smithford Fire Department does on a daily basis protecting this community and every single one of us in this room, that to me should be the priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2934.646s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you really want to be strong about it, you would hold this mayor, Mayor Stephanie Burke, hold her feet to the ground and do not move on that budget until you get your answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2943.809s">[Robert Penta]</a>: for more policemen and a new police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2946.411s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Be happy to answer any questions if anybody has them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2950.234s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4151.495s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4154.658s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm a member of the Sarkis party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4156.76s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I'd just like to say, and I brought this up about two or three weeks ago,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4160.802s">[Robert Penta]</a>: regarding the bubble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4162.644s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's a bond council that wrote the bond proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4167.048s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you think of this thing logically and you think it through, you're allowing a private for-profit business to come in and take advantage of a city's bond at the city's interest rate and for them to make a profit on city time, on city property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4181.922s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, if we're going to do that, are we opening up Pandora's box to the swimming pool?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4187.798s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Are we opening up to the skating rink?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4189.199s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Are we opening up to the new $14.5 million science labs that we have in the school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4193.3s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Anything that we've had a bond that can have an effect upon the people within this community, we are now saying, come on in, pay us for what you think you want to pay us, and we'll entertain it if not accept it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4206.285s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, Councilman Marks made an interesting comment a few weeks ago when we had this discussion as it relates to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4211.467s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If they're putting so much time into the bubble, I wish they would put more time into the educational process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4215.632s">[Robert Penta]</a>: at the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4216.932s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They put a lot of time into hiring 5,000 administrators at over $95,000 a piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4221.053s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as a matter of fact, one of them was one who was terminated from one school, but hired back up at the high school at $95,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4229.035s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A lot of interest, a lot of input went into that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4232.735s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But when we look at this, you have a definitely, you have a legal question here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4236.456s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think this council voted, all seven of you voted to have a report back from the bond council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4243.017s">[Robert Penta]</a>: From the bond counsel who wrote this for the city of Medford, the legal question is, can the city of Medford rent or lease this piece of property to a private for-profit company and then charge back the city of Medford for its use of the same property that they have leased for a measly $75,000 a year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4264.163s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because that's all they give in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4266.144s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And don't forget, if you're right, Councilor Marks, if it's a 10-year deal and the city gets the bond,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4271.288s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not costing these people anything, because they will write this off on a tax write-off for 10 years for its use, especially if it's a for-profit business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4280.451s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what are we going to get at the very end as a community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4283.012s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Whatever the repairs that are needed to take place are going to take place, and who's going to have to pay for the city?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4289.134s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These are the type of questions that would be great ballot questions to put out there during a general election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4295.396s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because if it's such a wonderful argument and a wonderful issue, the pros and cons of public hearings<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4301.487s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and meetings at city council and at school committee meetings would serve the purpose of whether the people want this or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4308.192s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think if I had a student up at the high school right now, I would be more concerned on the educational quality of where that student needs to go or would like to go rather than arguing over a bubble that might have some not only logistical, legal questions, but would have questions over the fact that what are we doing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4325.003s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Taxpayers' money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4327.024s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When we as members of the Medford City Council voted for the science labs,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4331.307s">[Robert Penta]</a>: for the skating rink, for the swimming pool, and Edgeley Field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4334.63s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We were taking the taxpayers of Medford's money and the bond rating that we were getting at that particular time to purchase that piece of bond in behalf of the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4345.058s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're not doing that now because what you're doing is you're abdicating the responsibility of the bond responsibility by the city and you're allowing an outside for-profit business to come in here, take advantage of it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4356.923s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and pay the city a measly $75 an hour, $75,000 a year, while at the same time make thousands and hundreds and thousands of dollars over the life of the bubble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4367.787s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's not good financing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4369.387s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That doesn't make good sense to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4371.428s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think this needs a lot more attention to the fact that you need all the legal questions asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4376.15s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think you really need to compare this with this upcoming budget in the school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4381.007s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It makes a huge difference as it relates to where priorities are going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4385.669s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We just got through talking about public safety, policemen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4388.109s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We talked about a new police station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4389.83s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, you're talking now about a bubble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4392.351s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And before the bubble bursts on the city of Medford and you get stuck with a financial boondoggle, I think we need to say, let's slow down and let's really take a look and see what's going on, because that's what this is all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4404.815s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's your money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4405.715s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's our money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4406.675s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's the city's money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4407.936s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's everybody's money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4409.373s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if we're going to allow a private for-profit business to come in and take advantage of our community and our real estate to the detriment of our city, for a measly $75,000, then you're really selling yourself short, and you're selling the taxpayers short.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4427.336s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5151.586s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Penter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5152.526s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I live at Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5154.547s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm a member of the Saugus party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5156.607s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My take on this is just a little bit different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5158.507s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We can talk about the maintenance, and it's quite obvious that the maintenance is an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5162.128s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I'd like to get into the legality of the bond in and of itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5165.809s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When the city of Medford went out for the bond in this particular field,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5181.282s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, my purpose of saying the legality of it is because I would like to ask a question, and I think it needs to be answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5187.506s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The question is very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5188.607s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The City of Medford owns the property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5190.808s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, will the City of Medford own the dome that the renter wants to come in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5195.511s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if that's the situation, I think it changes the whole intent of what the City of Medford's bond was all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5201.533s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and that bond being for the exclusive use, again, of the fields, Medford folks and students first, and however the rentals take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5210.001s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you're now building a bond, and now you want to build a bubble, and the bubble will declare an ownership of authority of the person that has it, and the city of Medford will not have priority of the use of those fields.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5219.791s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I would hope one of you folks on the council would make that request to our city solicitor to ask him<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5226.18s">[Robert Penta]</a>: if in fact this is even legal to do and what authority, if anything, does the city or will they have over the dome itself for the purposes of liability and for the purposes of its use?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5237.444s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it's an important question to ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5240.025s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I have no problem with the bubble, whether it goes or doesn't go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5242.906s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think you need to have this legal question as it relates to this particular matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5246.767s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5247.827s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I would hope somebody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5285.706s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm trying to clarify the motion, if you'd give me the courtesy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5290.109s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Also, the fact of the matter is, does this interfere with the bond that originally was written, therefore allowing, as such right now, the city of Medford entertaining a private entity to come in, use its field for its particular purpose, the dome?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5303.958s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think that question needs to be asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5306.639s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5310.382s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you can review that on tape, if you'd like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7684.979s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Pentez, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7687.88s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm a member of this board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7689.001s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I want to thank Councilor Lungelkorn for bringing this up, but more importantly, I'd like to thank the squeaky wheel of South Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7694.692s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and threats, because she's been fighting this battle for five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7697.799s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And for five years, as Councilor Caraviello said, some things have gotten better, some things have gotten worse, and some things haven't even been addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7704.521s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I want to pick up on the second part of your resolution, Councilor, where you indicate, and any other related issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7710.126s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In early spring of this past year, when the city had its street-sweeping program, the City of Medford engaged in the South Medford area, as well as other parts of the city, in a tag-and-toe process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7721.456s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then on April 29th, this immediate April 29th,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7725.392s">[Robert Penta]</a>: the mayor of this community instructed the police department to stop tagging and towing as it relates to the street sweeping that was continuing on after that time to this day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7734.155s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, I don't know what the reason is for the stopping of the tagging and the towing, but anyone who got a ticket and was tagged and towed, as the gentleman who was here last week, they should get their money back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7745.4s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Every single person in this city who's been tagged and towed should get their money back because the mayor abruptly stopped on April 29th<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7789.128s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The issue revolves more than Mr. Lester.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7790.669s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It revolves around everyone else that received a ticket.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7793.932s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Subsequent to April 29th, on a Friday, when the Police Department was informed by the Mayor not to give out any more ticket and tags, the Police Department still went down the street with the bullhorn, telling people the streets were going to be sweeped, but nobody was ticketed and tagged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7807.042s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, prior to that, during the early spring sweep, people were tagged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7822.685s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It is, and I spoke to the police department personally, and the Councilor can check himself if he so chooses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7826.749s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Point of information, Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7830.932s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, you have your contacts over there, and anyone who wants to refute what I'm saying, I'd be more than happy to apologize, but I'm not apologizing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7838.115s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The fact of the matter is it did happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7839.836s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We've had this discussion before as it relates to sweet streeping here in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7844.998s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have our tax bills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7846.979s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have your water and sewer tax bills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7849.26s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Those go out, and whether you're the homeowner or the business owner or you're the renter, it's up to the person who owns the property<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7856.16s">[Robert Penta]</a>: to instruct the person who's either renting and the homeowner or the business person who's there in that particular street for whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7863.747s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If it takes a year, and this is what we talked about almost four years ago, if it takes a year to get into a street signage program where all the streets in this community are signed and everybody becomes aware of it, we won't have to talk about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7876.12s">[Robert Penta]</a>: posting papers on a tree, or stapling them on whatever you have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7879.923s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have many opportunities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7881.605s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you had public access here in this community, you'd be able to see it, but we don't have that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7897.019s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It may be the same issues, but still nothing seems to be happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7899.63s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And unfortunately, a whole host of individuals have been tagged and towed needlessly because, in fact, they may have changed their mind, maybe because of the complaints, and that's all well and good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7909.256s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if you don't have a stationary in-house program that's consistent, you can't pick on one week and then cancel it on another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7917.06s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I would recommend to anyone who received a ticket prior to April 29, was tagged and towed, go to City Hall and demand, because this administration stopped it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7927.426s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Can I finish, please, without you being so rude?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7930.267s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is it possible that you can for once in your life just stand there and be decent when I'm at this podium?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7940.21s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's my recommendation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7941.431s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would hope the council in some shape, manner or form consults with the administration, asks them for the purposes of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7948.247s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let this year go by, it's a big mistake that took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7951.528s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why, in fact, they stopped on April 29th, why the police department no longer is tagging and towing for street sweeping, I don't know, but it's the mayor of this community right now that's done that, and anyone that's gotten the ticket prior to that, unfortunately, doesn't have any recourse unless they get some recourse from City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7968.593s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1097.535s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Pinter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1098.495s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I live at Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., a former member of your August body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1102.857s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I've attended both of those meetings and there is a major concern in the West Medford area as well as throughout the entire city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1109.14s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But these signs did have, in fact, an impact many years ago as it related to crime taking place, especially in the West Medford area and other parts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1118.327s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it's a beginning that needs to take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1122.049s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There are 100 people strong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1123.47s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They have petitions walking the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1125.852s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the real need that needs to take place is this upcoming budget that you folks are going to have to deal with here on the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1131.817s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This administration has to step up to the plate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1134.39s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and recognize the fact that in the petition that's running around, they're asking for 10 additional street police officers over the next two years, whether they be bicycle files, fellas, gals, and whether they be motorcycle, walking patrolmen, patrol ladies, or just more people for visibility in the neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1151.076s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a desperate need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1152.477s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're serious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1153.417s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They don't like their houses broken into.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1155.118s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They don't like their cars hijacked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1157.178s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And they don't like to be held hostage in their own community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1161.18s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So when only 72 police officers<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1164.497s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On the patrol, in our city method right now, we need to increase that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1168.24s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We need to represent ourselves as being a community that is responding to the needs of the community, especially in the areas of public safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1175.184s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I believe it's in this city council and prior city councils that's always mandated that public safety was its number one issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1183.35s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you, sir.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4631.206s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Please state your name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4633.187s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Good evening, Mr. President and council members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4636.148s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Penta, Xero, Summit Road, Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4638.589s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm a member of this board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4640.35s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I thank Mr. Capucci for coming forward because his flavor on the subject matter is different than mine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4645.441s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mine basically as history has a way of repeating itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4648.744s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Regarding public access here in the city of Medford, we are at the repeating stage once again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4653.928s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Since early 2013 to date, we, the Comcast and Verizon cable subscribers, have been charged the monthly public access fee totaling some $500,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4663.776s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And we, the subscribers, still have no public access station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4669.161s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What we heard from 2013 by the city administration was that the city will be asking for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4674.581s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Channel 3 records, bank statements, meeting minutes, and an inventory accounting of the Channel 3 Public Access Corporation, because then at that point in time, Channel 3 Corporation was filing for dissolution of its Chapter 3 Corporation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4689.005s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Records of expenditures of gasoline, restaurants, retail, supermarkets, hardware home suppliers, plumbing and air conditioning materials, building materials, auto supplies,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4701.128s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Miscellaneous expenses in bank and ATM withdrawals, along with deposits and credits from the banks in the accounting were examples that were supposed to have been forwarded to the city of Medford pursuant to the dissolution filing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4714.412s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As of this date, no accounting of any records, bank statements, meeting minutes, or accurate inventory accounting has ever been verified from channel three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4724.355s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Regarding the city's lack of providing public access TV,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4728.358s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The ever-going question since 2013 has been, why has the city failed to mandate that public access be made available as contractually applied for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4738.805s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Fast forward to today, and putting aside all the comments and issue regarding the forced ascertainment hearing, the former mayor's commission report regarding public cable access, and multiple council resolutions regarding this matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4755.193s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It seems that this administration feels that to spend some $500,000 for an access studio up in the back of Medford High School will serve in the best interest of a local public access station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4767.221s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't believe this to be in the best interest of our subscribers and citizens, and for the following reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4773.525s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's location, location, location that is the primary success staple of any business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4780.35s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The Medford High location will not serve the best interest for our public access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4785.341s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Examples as to why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4787.181s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Its public access is not on a main street that is centrally located.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4792.963s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The entranceway is not well lit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4795.023s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It is not easily accessible to walk up and to walk back the hill from the back to and from Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4803.025s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It presents a winter problem of ice and snow needing to be cleared at all times on the hill and the walkway to the school's back entrance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4810.947s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It presents a safety security problem for after school hours<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4814.88s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and nighttime lighting is at a minimum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4818.002s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As a major positive contrast to the Medford High location, the Medford Public Library serves as the best location for public access studio.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4827.326s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It is centrally located within our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4829.887s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It has walking convenience within the city's downtown area and bus routes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4834.53s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It is handicap accessible to being easily available for front door entrance for bus and cab transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4842.088s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It offers a great additional public educational opportunity for community public access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4848.252s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Medford's $500,000 bank deposits from Comcast and Verizon thus far will definitely produce at the library the space needs necessary for this development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4859.84s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As Councilor Caraviello has indicated by requesting the Massachusetts State Library Commission come to Medford to ascertain what state additional funding can be for the library to Ghana for the library's rehabilitation,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4871.903s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That, along with what I proposed last year during the Mayor's campaign to have a complaint present use and future use, along with the $500,000 funds that are readily available right now here in City Hall, could catapult the Medford Public Library to being Medford's premier central educational and social meeting spot that incorporates an entire community of opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4894.069s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This would be the perfect segue for having<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4896.987s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The Massachusetts State Library Commission realized that we are working to make our library a major focal point in our city, and their additional support position would certainly carry us to that potential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4909.972s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It would be an example of how a city fully realizes the community potential of its public library.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4916.575s">[Robert Penta]</a>: To my understanding and education thus far, this would be a first for the Massachusetts State Library Commission to co-invest with a city with matching funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4926.403s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The Medford Vocational School location, as is presently being entertained, could be a satellite location for students' learning of production and access operations as a school program offering separate and distinct from the public access studio.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4941.947s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This opportunity for community public access to be better located and more readily available should not be squandered away because of political posturing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4951.529s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mayor McGlynn's own committee report of June 2015 specifically stated,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4957.305s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We are a committee that feels that the best location will be in one that is conveniently and centrally located with its own entrance and exit and should be handicap accessible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4967.751s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The Method Public Library could serve no better location than the one that has been advised for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4974.595s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Also, with the city owning the property, annual rental payments will not have to be provided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4980.239s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Therefore, providing for more revenue to maintain, upgrade equipment,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4984.355s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and conveniently offer to the community programs that showcase our city and the families and subscribers that watch and use public access TV.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4993.638s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I respectfully ask that this honorable body of councilors request by a roll call vote that our city administration reconsider its position regarding public access to TV being at Medford High School and entertain the Medford Public Library as the location that will better serve our community in the Comcast and variable cable rate payers<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5013.732s">[Robert Penta]</a>: for paying for their public access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5026.477s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, I have a question that I presented before the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5029.158s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I was just wondering if anyone would entertain that because I think this is a very important issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5033.7s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a lot of money and I think it offers a great opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5825.044s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All set?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5828.372s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, as just a point of reference, for the last six years, prior to last year, don't forget the city of Medford got waivers from the Mass Department, State Department of Library Commissioners, because the city did not put enough money in there when, in fact, they did have the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5840.438s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But putting that aside, with all due respect to Councilor Knight, if you look at the Mass Department of Education, cable, public access, and the teaching of public access is an allowable educational product here in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5855.217s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It can't be a deed restriction, or even, I don't know what the deed restriction can be, because the library is an educational thing, and the public access is educational.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5862.5s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It works hand in hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5863.84s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as I indicated earlier, what Councilor Caraviello might have met and talked to those folks from the state, they've never had a co-investing partner like the City of Medford would have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5873.904s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if we could upgrade not only the building, the roof, the second floor, whatever needs to be done with the $500,000 that the city has at the present time, and moving that forward, having a full public access,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5884.083s">[Robert Penta]</a>: here, right here in the city of Medford, centrally located, that would help to expedite.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5888.604s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If the administration was serious about the public library, as was a campaign issue during this past year, we wouldn't have to worry about 140 pages being done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5897.626s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You'd go out and hire someone ASAP and make that presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5901.027s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if they knew that the city of Medford was willing to invest its money instead of asking for all of the money from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the board of library commissioners, it's the first of its kind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5911.178s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think they would be more receptive to that than just the plain grant application.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5915.46s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't see any what the problem would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5917.241s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because if we want to move this thing forward, we have the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5920.923s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It isn't like we don't have the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5923.084s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're not offering the service that's contractually been obligated for through Verizon and Comcast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5929.287s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You do not have public access here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5932.788s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And we can go back to resolutions from 2013 bringing forward<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5936.44s">[Robert Penta]</a>: where the votes have been seven to nothing on this council floor to go forward and find out what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5942.243s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can't even get the records back from the former Cable 3, the Channel 3.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5946.926s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We don't even know if they've actually been formally dissolved by the Karma of the Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5950.788s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They could still be in operation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5952.93s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Nobody knows nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5953.85s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We haven't received anything back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5955.851s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the onus of responsibility, with all due respect, Mr. President, right now can come from this council, because I think you're all on the same page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5962.582s">[Robert Penta]</a>: you want to see something done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5964.302s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And to find out that they're doing some work now up at that school, and this council not even being notified or entertained about it, that doesn't speak well about transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5974.904s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They can do all the restructuring up there they want and do it for another purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5979.045s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is more important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5980.525s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How and where public access is going to go, how the $500,000 is going to go, how it's going to be centrally located, and how it can be immersed into this community<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5988.775s">[Robert Penta]</a>: as an educational product, ready, willing, and able to go locally, not segued in a certain part of this community that has too many obstacles to make the thing work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5998.999s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=1256.547s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Penter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=1257.608s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I live at Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of the Saugus party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=1261.408s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I was on the Medford City Council on the year that this transfer did take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=1266.049s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was a very emotionally impact situation at the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=1269.51s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Folks that had certain disabilities were very excited over the fact that this opportunity would present itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=1276.071s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the fact of the matter is since the property has not been used, I believe for the last two years for the purposes so stated back in 1991,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=1283.51s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe, Mr. Solicitor, it would indicate that it possibly would revert back to the City of Method because of its non-use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=1290.674s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And Bridgewell really has no opportunity to say to the City of Method, you have to buy it back from us to negotiate because, in fact, it was the Heckner Center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=1299.198s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Whatever the agreement, the handshake was between the Heckner Center and Bridgewell, that came after the fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=1303.861s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It continued on, so to speak, as the educational nonprofit entity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=1308.823s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But when they stopped using the property at that location, I believe,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=1312.875s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The council vote and the record will reflect that once it's no longer used for that purpose, it remains as a city of Medford piece of property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=1320.518s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=1369.14s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I believe the legal action was predicated upon the city of Medford and the Hegner Center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=1372.883s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what they did after that became subsequent to the original intent of the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=2955.829s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, and I've been masked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=2958.33s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm a member of this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=2959.71s">[Robert Penta]</a>: One of the things I think you really need to be concerned about is the annual report that just came out by Republic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=2964.955s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They indicated that they did just a little bit over a million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=2967.956s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Their intention was to do about a million eight for their first year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=2971.256s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now they're blaming a bad winter, they're blaming the Kratik Bridge, they're blaming a whole host of other issues as to why they didn't receive that and generate the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=2979.558s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If that doesn't tell you that they're going to go on a very aggressive ticketing here in the city of Medford, something is going to tell you that, because they're not going to be out here not to make money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=2991.327s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, the fact of the matter is that we only got $30,000 this year from them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=2995.568s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe we're getting another $230,000 from fines and we're getting another $250,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3000.269s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Um, on the, it's an annual payment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3003.109s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not a one time annual thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3005.03s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's $250,000 annually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3006.81s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's supposed to go back to the cities and towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3008.93s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So that probably only generated about $560,000 here to the city of Medford for this past year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3014.111s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But that included fines and that included the two 50.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3017.072s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the actual,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3018.751s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Revenue was only $30,000 because they never even got anywheres near the million eight It wasn't supposed to be a revenue enhancer, but the present mayor calls it a revenue turnover I I don't know how it's a revenue turnover if it's not a revenue enhancer Because if you're turning over more cars allegedly people are going to take the spots and pay more money no matter how you look at it It's a revenue enhancer Councilor Marks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3043.121s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We can go back to 2009 when the report was submitted here<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3046.43s">[Robert Penta]</a>: which you and the chief and other members of this community served upon it, and you're right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3050.313s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The first thing was to have revenue traffic enforcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3054.877s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And on the last page, the priority of the committee was to have single head meters or double head meters, you know, throughout the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3061.863s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That was the easiest and common sense way for people to understand what they would have to pay for when they're parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3067.888s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And we don't see that right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3069.709s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think if you just continue to go on and you realize,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3073.087s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that if you're going to change the contract, the contract is very specific as it states.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3077.89s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If any changes to the kiosk take place, the city of Medford has to pay for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3081.812s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So whether you buy these doublehead or singlehead meters, it's going to have to be negotiated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3087.675s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I know your city solicitor is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3089.256s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's going to have to be negotiated too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3090.856s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the fact of the matter is, they didn't get anywhere near the $1 million that they were looking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3095.459s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you're going to probably see a very aggressive movement right now by Republic as it relates to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3101.875s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let me tell you an experience I had this afternoon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3103.656s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I was in Medford Square with one of the people from Republic, a gentleman who was very kind and very courteous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3108.759s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And he watched two particular people, one gentleman in particular, who parked his car maybe six cars away from the kiosk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3116.322s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He drove by, didn't even see the kiosk, and just went along his way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3120.004s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He was stopped, and he was told he had to put the money in the kiosk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3122.306s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He said he didn't even know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3123.866s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you have an SUV or other type of vehicle that's there, when you're driving by and you don't see it, and if you don't come from the city of Medford and you don't see it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3131.224s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, you're just going to be subject to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3133.026s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And another one was, somebody just mentioned it, I think Mr. Capucci, if the screen is very light and you can't read it and you can't see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3140.572s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it was you, Councilor Caraviello, who brought this up way back in January of 2015 as one of the first arguments that you had against Republic was the fact that the matter of these kiosks were very hard to read, especially when the sun is hitting on them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3153.264s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you're a senior citizen, it's making it even worse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3156.553s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's a cost factor that the republic is going to have to address and it should not be on the city side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3161.396s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I would, if in fact you have to go forward any further with this whole program for which I would be totally opposed to, I believe the meters would be a better way of representing common sense to a person having to park and having to put money in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3176.505s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But more importantly, I think the city can find itself in a negotiating point as it relates to where they would want to go with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3182.909s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Remember that $250,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3185.312s">[Robert Penta]</a>: by Mayor McGlynn, former Mayor McGlynn, was very specific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3188.295s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was to be used specifically for the business districts here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=3193.92s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And to use it for any other purpose for which would serve hopefully a better purpose for people in the business districts, I think that's gonna have to be a negotiated tool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=5946.555s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Robert Pentz, Zero Summit Road, Medford Mass, former colleague of this August body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=5952.079s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On January 29th of this past year, Republic met with the mayor of this community as it relates to certain parking issues that have been going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=5959.003s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I would just like to revert back to July 23rd of 2015, when the local press, the mayor at that time who was running, had sent in a press release indicating that there were 12 things<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=5972.347s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that she would like to see take place as it relates to Republic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=5976.77s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the request at that time was to have it done immediately, not in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=5981.853s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And we're still waiting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=5983.594s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But she updated that on August 23rd of this past year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=5989.217s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what she updated, strike that, on August 30th of this past year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=5992.659s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what she updated was another press release.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=5995.161s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And she also sent out a survey to the peoples of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=5999.604s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the survey was particular, in one particular area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6002.182s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Question number one, would you be supportive of exempting senior citizens from having to pay to park in the city of Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6009.166s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe our seniors should not have to encounter any frustration in their daily lives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6014.349s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's part of the base commentary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6017.091s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And on the second page of the survey, there were four questions, and the very first one was, do you think senior citizens should be exempt from paying or parking at kiosks and meters?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6027.177s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I believe it was October 23rd, and the debate that we had<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6031.992s">[Robert Penta]</a>: She publicly announced, once again, seniors should not have to pay, and she was making that a priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6038.654s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is now September 20th, I mean, strike that, March 23rd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6043.116s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is a huge issue, because no matter where I go walking around this city, and I'm quite sure members of this council have heard the same thing, you know, the seniors of this community believe that they're going to be entitled to this discount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6055.06s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was a campaign issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6056.12s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was a campaign promise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6058.121s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was a campaign press release.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6060.242s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was a double-headed story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6061.706s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it was a survey they went out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6063.687s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe, in all honesty, if you're going to make promises such as this, you need to honor them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6068.93s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If not, have a discussion as to why not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6071.531s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't think this council has had any discussion with the mayor and with Republic as it relates to any of the 12 issues that were reported on July 23rd in the local paper and on August 30th, as was presented by then-candidate Mayor Burke, as she is now, Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6089.772s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I just think it's too important of an issue, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6104.315s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm just alluding to the fact that this is what I'm hearing more and more as I'm walking the streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6108.355s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Give the mayor an opportunity sometime, I have no problem with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6111.516s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the fact of the matter is there's nothing on the table that even talks about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6114.676s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That was the number one question in the survey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6117.077s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was the number one comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6119.044s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and the press release.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6120.425s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And when you lead with something like that, and you're leading people to believe that this is what it's about, and thinking there's a rainy day that's going to go away with some sunshine for seniors, we don't even know if it's going to be 55, 62, 65.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6132.493s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know what the number is, but whatever it is, so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6136.116s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's for the senior citizens of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6139.258s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And with that being said, I would hope one member of the council, if not the council in general, would basically make the request of the mayor, if in fact she is going to honor that pledge,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6148.123s">[Robert Penta]</a>: of granting senior citizens a discount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6150.785s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And when you people have your meeting with her, that as well as the other 12 things that were outlined on July 23rd in the local press, which still haven't come to fruition, need to be addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6161.634s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, we all ran for politics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6164.136s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Some of us win, some of us lose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6166.118s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you have to stand by what you're running on and the principles of what you're running on and the comments that you're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6172.583s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And they just can't be there for the sake of being political and making political hay<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6177.04s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's just appeasing the people that you're talking to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6181.141s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They've met January 29th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6182.361s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's obvious that you guys have no idea, and ladies, no idea what took place on January 29th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6188.363s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't know what the discussions have been.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6190.284s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's obvious that something is going on that you're not aware of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6193.825s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Councilor Caraviello, I think the conversation that we had a few weeks ago, you haven't even gotten an update to the financial question that you asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6202.587s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Part of the attachment that you never got, so they're just keeping you in limbo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6206.291s">[Robert Penta]</a>: whatever it might be, I would just hope, and I would ask one of my colleagues, one of my colleagues that are presently here, if they would put that in the form of a motion for a report to get an answer back on, because I think it's in all fairness to all the seniors in this community, it was a major campaign issue, and it still hasn't been addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6240.92s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, Mr. President, let me ask you a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6242.681s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How could that be determined when that issue has not even been brought up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6246.182s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've had other financial issues brought up, but you haven't had the issues of the senior citizen parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6251.184s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's separate and distinct unto itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6281.308s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I beg to disagree with you, Council President DelaRosa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6284.15s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's nothing in the records that even reflect that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fpTYfEs6_wM&t=6286.492s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm making that as a public request right now to have that as part of the official agenda when you folks meet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=805.599s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=809.141s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Pater.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=810.461s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I live at Zero Summit Road, a former member of the Zargas Party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=813.903s">[Robert Penta]</a>: First of all, to answer your question, Councilor De La Ruzo, Council President De La Ruzo, the Board of Appeals received a letter from Tufts University through their developers that they have rejected, and they're not going forward with the purchase of the sale of the piece of property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=826.723s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I would hope it's because at the board of appeals meeting on the night that it took place, there wasn't one person that was there for it from the neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=832.985s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As a matter of fact, they were all against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=834.786s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=835.646s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Number two, I think the city of Medford has a responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=838.747s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If in fact they do believe in keeping its history and a piece of its history, here's a classic opportunity for them to engage in this particular part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=846.39s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The method historical commission only has $700 a year in its budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=850.111s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a pittance as compared to what the value of properties are here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=854.331s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And right around the corner, with the demolition delay permit hanging on them, you have another piece of property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=860.153s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's called the Cabernet House.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=861.414s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a French colony house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=862.975s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's due any day now to come up as an issue of whether it's going to be destroyed with a present purchase for value being a contractor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=870.658s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, when you talk about history here in the city of Medford, it isn't that it's on Toroweb or South Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=876.443s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's who owns the property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=878.244s">[Robert Penta]</a>: At Tufts University, with a billion-dollar endowment, not a million or a hundred million, a billion-dollar endowment, there is no need right now for them to have this piece of property to be sold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=891.033s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, they're getting a little bit tricky with this, because what they're trying to do is sell the property last week on Zillow, advertising it, and then they subsequently changed the language, not to say that it could be subdivided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=903.982s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's just a single-house piece of property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=906.545s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, the single home historical district, that's the terminology that needs to take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=911.489s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what puts the preservation restriction on this piece of property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=915.793s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And Tufts University, if they want to really be the good neighbor, they can come up to the plate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=919.716s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They have two good bites of the apple of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=922.118s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They can lead on this one here if they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=923.86s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They can make the application to the Commonwealth of Mass, for which there is a pamphlet that tells you that it's called There is a Difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=930.786s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's all from the Mass Historical Society.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=933.94s">[Robert Penta]</a>: establishing historical districts, there's a dish they have out on them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=938.002s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What they could do, they could go forward and make this application in behalf of preserving the piece of property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=943.385s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Or in the alternative, what they could do, they could place a restriction on their deed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=948.287s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So any subsequent for value who purchases that, which would be the next person for value, there would be a deed restriction that would be recorded at the Middlesex South Registry of Deeds in perpetuity, which means<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=959.57s">[Robert Penta]</a>: it could never be subdivided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=961.351s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The house and the land stays as one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=964.274s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's all that the neighbors are looking for, to preserve their neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=968.437s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because if that does get itself subdivided and other houses go there, you will have an increase in parking, you will have an increase of traffic in the neighborhood for which they don't need at the present time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=979.225s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As members of the Medford City Council, I believe you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=981.567s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you really believe in history and preserving it and keeping it as a part of what the city of Medford's all about,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=987.002s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You do have a responsibility, and I would probably suggest and ask that you fellows and ladies make a pitch to the Medford Historical Commission to support the residents and the abutters and the people of Medford who want to keep this house as an historical piece of property and for the city of Medford to file with the Commonwealth of Mass Historical Commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1008.602s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If in fact Tufts University won't do it, in either way,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1011.693s">[Robert Penta]</a>: to preserve this as a historical landmark here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1016.056s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, Tufts University, this isn't like new to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1018.958s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They just got through doing this on grandfather's house on South Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1023.021s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And fortunately, on this piece of property, the residents are aware, they're smart enough, and they now realize what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1029.546s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That didn't happen on South Street, unfortunately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1031.828s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That happened in the summertime.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1033.549s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This one here is a little bit more advanced where the neighborhood was aware of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1037.252s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And also, if you go to the last meeting and one of the meeting minutes of the historical commission,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1042.305s">[Robert Penta]</a>: the meetings of October 29th, 2015, what was presented that time to Tufts University that they would go forward and sell the property with the request of maintaining a historical piece of property, but not to disallow them to subdivide it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1056.795s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And at that point in time, the developer and Tufts was not going to agree with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1063.48s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It doesn't cost a lot of money to make this filing of this application.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1067.943s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what you're doing is you're preserving<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1069.925s">[Robert Penta]</a>: something that the city has had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1071.066s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If anybody knows the history of that property, it goes way back, way before 1840.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1075.327s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It goes back to two brothers that owned that piece of property, who were involved not only in shipbuilding, but were also involved in marketing, you know, internationally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1085.132s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as the lady who just came and spoke before us, there are other houses on South Street that don't have an historical designation, and if they lose it, and somebody comes in and buys it, nobody's going to be able to do anything about it, because that's going to be their right to do it, whoever buys it to subdivide it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1099.815s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Taking all of this into consideration, and you might be asking, why are we here tonight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1103.398s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're here tonight for one reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1105.48s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The Historical Commission hopefully will have a meeting, because they've been asked to have an emergency meeting, to put a stop to this and have Tufts University put a stop to this, or become a partner so it doesn't get itself subdivided in any shape, manner, or form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1119.071s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Tufts University could sell that property today for a million dollars for whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1123.314s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The purchase of a value will give Tufts University the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1126.017s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They'll make their money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1126.797s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It doesn't make any difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1128.33s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But to have it with the condition of being subdivided, the question is, I don't believe Tussel's going to get any money back, so why would you want to give an outside developer an opportunity to make that money at the expense of the neighborhood, at the expense of the citizens of Medford, and at the expense of our city's history?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1143.574s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It doesn't make any difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1145.014s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe that there are plenty of people out there who would love to buy that house, live in that house knowing it's a piece of Medford, it's a piece of history,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1152.535s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and enjoy the land that's around it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1154.356s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a unique opportunity that many homes in this community doesn't even have that opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1159.819s">[Robert Penta]</a>: With that being said, I would hope that somebody would be rational enough to realize that these folks aren't here, you know, on a lock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1167.343s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're here on a mission, and the mission is to employ you as our elected officials to look into this and be a positive and affirmative backer for their position to keep Medford's history alive and well and not to have it deteriorated into a subdivision<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1181.689s">[Robert Penta]</a>: to be sold off to a developer, for that developer to make money, and again, we lose another piece of Medford's history.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1187.672s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1337.769s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The fastest they probably think it could be completed by would be within six to seven months, if that would be the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1342.833s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The quickest and the easiest way to do it would be to have Tufts University, they themselves, recognizing the fact that the neighbors don't want the property subdivided, they could just put an addendum or an attachment to the deed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1353.982s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And while this is taking place, if it takes more than six months to sell the property, the attachments on the deed, it's duly recorded, it's a done deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1360.327s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And at the same time, the city will have its opportunity to not only do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1364.17s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You bring up a good question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1365.444s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because don't let it just be this house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1367.266s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's all the houses in this, all the historic pieces of property in this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1370.568s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it should be something that should be looked at because I don't think you're going to want to deal with this one at a time, maybe every other month or every third or fourth month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1377.154s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it's time that the city either takes a real hard look at what it has for its history and its properties and its values and put it all together so you don't have to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1385.481s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But to answer your question, six, seven months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1959.008s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1960.489s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Two points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1961.13s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The president of Tufts university, Walnut Hill royalty, Ian Barber-Rubel, who's the public, they're well aware of what you're talking about, about the restriction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1968.695s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the ball is well in their court and they've had this information for well over a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1971.958s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Um, and I, I just think that's important to note.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1974.6s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I, and I think the strength of a roll call vote by the council would be apropos at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1980.625s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Sorry, I upset your apple cart, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7425.654s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Penter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7426.514s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I live at Zero Summit Road, a former member of this board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7429.896s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Quick correction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7432.378s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I was a member of the Fire Charter Commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7435.983s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that Charter Commission was a nine-member board at that time, duly authorized by state law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7440.305s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if it's seven now, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7442.686s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That might have to be checked into.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7444.186s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But one of the things, we had a book that was submitted at that time regarding the Charter Commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7450.348s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it had to be submitted with the majority and a minority report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7453.409s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It had to be resubmitted to the Medford City Council then at that time, and they had to vote it up or down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7457.871s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And at that time, and I know the issues were five,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7460.742s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But there were eight things on the ballot question that was incorporated in the ballot summary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7465.723s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And in that ballot summary in the book, it not only included the majority report, it included the minority report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7471.645s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I want to read one thing that's very important that should be an exact distinction that everybody knows what this charter commission can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7478.447s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We held at that point in time, 25 committee meetings and six public hearings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7484.608s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it was all relegated around the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7487.169s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It says,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7491.218s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The one line over here, notice of such public hearings shall be by public, oh wait a minute, not publication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7496.563s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was over here, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7498.184s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The commission believes that although additional time and repetitive debate was the necessary consequences of such action, the commission and the citizens affected by the recommendations required such courtesies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7510.295s">[Robert Penta]</a>: At that point in time, we were allotted, and again, by state statute, I don't know if it still allows, a legal representative, which would be an attorney at that point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7519.23s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We engaged someone who was a professional in the area of charter commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7523.292s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think I agree with the folks who believe, whether it be the call-in center or anyone else like that, their recommendations cannot bode the same as Medford citizens who would come forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7533.977s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The legal person, the legal expertise would take the thoughts and recommendations and put it into the legalese of being in writing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7543.322s">[Robert Penta]</a>: One other question I need to ask you, Councilor Marks, and I thank you for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7547.684s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You used the word appointed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7549.873s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I'm assuming you mean elected in December, I mean in November, if that's the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7558.52s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Cause that, that's a huge distinction in terminology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7618.759s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The unfortunate part, and there was a couple of meetings that were held at the public library as it relates to the reviews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7624.044s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The reviews could only become operative if and when<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7627.439s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's presented as a charter commission update to the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7630.922s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can have all the reviews you want, but to have it cast in stone three, four or five years, it would be a mandate that would be included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7637.607s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That was one of the terminologies that we try to get into the budget, I mean, into the charter back in 1987, prior to the 1987.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7644.612s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Unfortunately, the majority of the members on the board didn't buy into it for whatever the reasons were back then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7649.896s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There were a whole host of things that were discussed that what Councilors, you know, having the city auditor come under the control of the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7657.234s">[Robert Penta]</a>: because that was a miscue that wasn't found in the legislation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7659.935s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And let me tell you, the law as it's presently written has some grammatical mistakes in it, too, that are just starting to surface now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7669.319s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So this is not going to be just like a very easy task.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7672.32s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We went through every single word, every single sentence, the spelling, and the proper pronunciation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7679.207s">[Robert Penta]</a>: in grammatical corrections, excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7682.768s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is going to take a long time because it's been 33 years and there's a lot of changes that have taken place from 1977 when this first charter commission started by signatures from the street and finally got itself approved back in 1985 on the election ballot, 1986 it became operative with state statute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7699.495s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I would strongly suggest that the more multiple meetings that you have, the better it's going to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7705.239s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And even if somebody wants to repeat themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7707.561s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I'll tell you, one of the classic things that took place during our charter meetings were the idea that we could change our minds because of the input that people brought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7716.147s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the input that people brought could sometimes change your mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7719.31s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You become so stereotyped through the years because you never had this opportunity to hear somebody else speak or what their ideas might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7726.135s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yeah, 30 years is a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7727.736s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Some things maybe do stay the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7729.519s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maybe some things have changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7731.24s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But to go forward with change, you have to be willing to adapt and recognize it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7736.642s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yesterday just doesn't work today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7738.243s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Or maybe some of the things of yesterday are just as good as they are today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7742.225s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You need to get — if this is really going to be successful, you need to have as many meetings open and notorious to the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7748.407s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We had 25 committee meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7750.448s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We had six public hearings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7752.089s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you couldn't ask for more than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7753.91s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We had a majority of — there was a nine-member board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7756.591s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The final vote was six to three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7758.392s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Doesn't make any difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7759.8s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The law allows you to have that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7762.262s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The taxpayers of this community got the booklet, majority, minority report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7765.806s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They got the question in front with all the addendums, the adding and the subtractions to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7770.384s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's the game plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7771.545s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's going to take an awful lot of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7773.667s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I just would strongly suggest that while you're taking this first step and going forward, you've got to keep an open mind to every single possibility that you would want to do with this plan A form of government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7785.578s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you're getting a pushback that other people might say, we should review all forms of government, you have to entertain that because that's what a charter review is about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=7793.525s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9684.953s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, two quick comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9686.194s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Barpenta zero summit road farmer member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9688.913s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, I'm standing on this side of the rail, and I feel somewhat vindicated, because when I sat over there, I was watching the same thing people accused me of what took place here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9698.659s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know if it's this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9700.22s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maybe it's the seat, George.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9701.421s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It could be the seat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9703.182s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know, you know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9704.923s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But again, refreshing my memory, going back when we did this, we had conversations like this way back when.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9713.453s">[Robert Penta]</a>: when people would come from the audience when they were talking about childhood change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9716.695s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, we had big issues back then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9718.556s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was the former city manager at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9720.938s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He was one of the issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9721.858s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the other one was taking over the police department, having a police commissioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9725.521s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That stirred the pot within the city of Medford at that point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9728.403s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's the reason why the signatures went out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9730.564s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm going to disagree with you, Janie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9732.025s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think signatures or this route, either route works, depending.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9736.648s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And they're both legal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9737.548s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you can't say that they don't work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9740.445s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would support Council Mark's proposition of having a Committee of the Whole meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9744.407s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And Mr. President, even though it's a resolution to have the City of Sicily draft a proposal, in this proposal there are ingredients.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9754.211s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I'm assuming that's what the Committee of the Whole will elicit from the people who will come to the podium, talk about what the ingredients might be, and that's the beginning of getting this process going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9765.216s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Passion ran very deep here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9767.973s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But don't let it interfere with the eye on the prize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9772.176s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the eye on the prize is making sure that the people of the city have an opportunity to review this charter as many ways as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9780.481s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And they're afforded that opportunity to talk about it, to discuss it, and vote on it as many times as need be before the final product is presented to the taxpayers of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9790.508s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10584.189s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, my name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, former member of this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10589.991s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Last Tuesday night, along with myself and other taxpayers who came up before this podium,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10595.678s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The resolution that was introduced by Councilor Lungo-Koehn found itself in a libelous rebuttal by our superintendent, Mr. Belson, where he not only attacked Councilor Lungo-Koehn, Councilor Marks, myself, and resident citizens who came before this podium to express their freedom of speech rights,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10614.82s">[Robert Penta]</a>: as it relates to what's going on at Medford High School regarding a bomb threat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10618.724s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As Councilor Lungo-Koehn just alluded to, when a bomb threat takes place between 8 and 9 in the morning and parents aren't told until around 6 o'clock at night, that's an 8 to 9 hour spread.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10628.673s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The lack of communication was huge there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10631.576s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And we were led to believe that protocols were in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10634.398s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think it was you, Councilor Scalpelli, along with Councilor Falco,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10637.421s">[Robert Penta]</a>: who indicated that you worked on a protocol procedure, and you were going to check it out the next night to make sure and to ensure the protocol was kept.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10645.004s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now we're finding out that something is being manufactured, and it'll be ready sometime in March as it relates to what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10651.807s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The interesting part about that, in his libelous commentary that he wrote, he indicated that we were instilling fear within this community because we were here talking about this bomb that took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10662.411s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think it was Mr. Candy, in his comment in return,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10666.013s">[Robert Penta]</a>: for which he's re-quoted, he stated, you create fear when you don't inform the people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10671.036s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10671.817s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They didn't get informed for almost eight to nine hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10675.059s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There wasn't a lockdown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10676.04s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There was nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10677.101s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No student, no teacher knew that there was a bomb threat that took place in that school, whether it was high level, low level, or big level, for whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10687.067s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, the same situation took place at Everett last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10690.77s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the same problem existed, a lack of communication,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10694.248s">[Robert Penta]</a>: between the school administration to the parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10697.569s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And because of that, you just can't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10702.73s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The superintendent should not be the sole provider of alleging that he can take care of the kids in that school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10709.911s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can't relay that commentary back to every single parent in that school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10714.512s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's not right, it's not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10716.072s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If it was his kids or your children, it'd be a different story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10722.044s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the irony to this whole classic event was on the next night, up at the high school, in the library, a meeting on safety at Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10733.789s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, if anyone went up there, you could walk into the building, no security guard, you could walk down the corridor to the library, no security guard, walk into the library.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10745.214s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What do you see, a police officer inside the library?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10747.468s">[Robert Penta]</a>: but no one at the front door, and nobody in the hallway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10750.191s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's just as Councilor Marks alluded to, anybody could have walked into that building, put anything in that building at any time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10755.816s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's not instilling fear, that's the facts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10758.179s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's the hot, cold facts of what we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10761.222s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And when you cut 80% of your security budget in the school department,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10764.685s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Over the past five or six years, that's what you get.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10767.468s">[Robert Penta]</a>: An insecure situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10769.03s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's not instilling fear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10770.611s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's telling you you need to get your act together and protect those children up at that school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10775.155s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because that's what it's all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10776.236s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's their responsibility as a school committee and as a superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10781.373s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's a damn shame that that even took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10784.116s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's a shame that you're now hearing that you're going to get something that Councilor Alongo-Kern has alluded to, you want a copy of it when it comes out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10791.685s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So apparently there wasn't any problem, I mean, any protocol.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10795.269s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There wasn't any management technique to take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10798.874s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as of yesterday, from what I understand,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10801.232s">[Robert Penta]</a>: from speaking to some of the students and a few of the teachers, they still weren't aware until many days after the fact that a bomb threat had taken place in that building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10809.794s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That is absolutely not fair and not right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10813.295s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Absolutely not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10814.296s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think it needs to be understood what a lockdown is as compared to what an evacuation is, as compared to a low level, a high level, and what a risk might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10823.278s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A teacher's not going to be Houdini to try to figure this out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10826.019s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And apparently, a parent isn't, especially if they're not even notified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10831.02s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yes, I will stand here and I say I resent the libelous comment made by the superintendent of schools who said because I came up here, and you, Councilor Lungo-Koehn, and you, Councilor Marks, and you, the citizens of this city, came up here to talk about a most egregious situation that's taking place in our city, and that's a lack of public safety and the communication to a parent if, in fact, public safety is challenged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10854.617s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You, Mr. Superintendent, you should be ashamed of yourself for writing that commentary and you should probably resign because of what you said and what you wrote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10864.043s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How dare you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10865.263s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How dare you insinuate that anyone who comes for a podium and expresses their opinion is causing fear when in fact they were representing facts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10874.869s">[Robert Penta]</a>: F-A-C-T-S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10876.47s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Facts that took place under your watch, Mr. Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10880.653s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, I thank you for allowing me to make my comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=10883.805s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2749.191s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Pantor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2750.132s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I live at Zero Summit, Rome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2751.572s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm a member of the Sarkis party that's deliberating here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2754.832s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On the outside, I'd like to thank my colleague, um, strike that council Lungo-Koehn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2759.173s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would consider a colleague forever because I think she's doing what she's supposed to be doing and that's the people's work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2765.635s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, you folks are sitting here as Councilors like I did for, for many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2771.196s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Your most important job is to protect,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2773.713s">[Robert Penta]</a>: to protect the students, the children of this community, because that's what our budget's all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2778.335s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what our school department budget's all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2780.476s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's what public safety is all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2782.517s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Sure, there's adults and there's businesses to be concerned about, but it's the children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2786.058s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what we're trying to do here is educate our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2789.4s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And how do we educate our children?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2790.781s">[Robert Penta]</a>: By teaching the difference between what is right and what is wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2793.582s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as they grow up to be youngsters and teenagers and adults, that's supposed to transcend into their everyday working operation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2801.892s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We've just had three incidences take place here in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2805.554s">[Robert Penta]</a>: One that took place in November, where there was a bomb threat, allegedly a bomb threat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2810.356s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Medford police went to the high school, and their dog sniffing dogs were not allowed into the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2816.479s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That didn't even find a response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2818.641s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then you had the incident five days before the election this past November, where at the McGlynn School, somebody broke into the school, ransacked through, I believe, eight teachers' bags, and you didn't hear about that until five days later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2831.524s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And now you have this incident that took place most recently, and as Councilor Marksley alluded to, eight days after the fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2838.927s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have a responsibility because when you do that budget each and every year, you're being led to believe by the school department and the school committee that everything is going properly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2847.33s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have a superintendent of schools whose primary responsibility, over and beyond educating the kids first,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2853.957s">[Robert Penta]</a>: is the safety of those kids in every single building that they are in here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2858.919s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that safety cannot be transcended by waiting days and days and days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2863.441s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now I understand what Councilor Falco was leading to, that tomorrow night there's a meeting, but there is a yes answer to this meeting tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2869.543s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the yes answer to this meeting is to let anybody who wants to talk about it come up, and the answer would be yes, allowing them to talk and speak about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2877.986s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because if they can't make it tomorrow night,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2879.928s">[Robert Penta]</a>: becomes informational for those who didn't know about it to be at the meeting tomorrow night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2884.411s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But more importantly, it's the public safety that really has not been addressed by the at-present school administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2892.678s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you said, Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Palacio, the two of you put together some kind of a program and the protocol hasn't been met,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2900.037s">[Robert Penta]</a>: then so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2900.998s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then somebody has to be held accountable and maybe their job should be put on the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2905.281s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because if it was their kid and their child was threatened with a bomb in the school and they weren't told about it until six or seven hours after the fact on a robocall, that doesn't satisfy or suffice the purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2916.91s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On January 18th, you had Groton, Ayers, Arlington, Tewksbury, Taunton,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2923.191s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Salisbury, Weymouth, Newton, Brighton, Boston, Swampscott, Lexington Minuteman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2928.833s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A bomb threat was over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2930.814s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Two things took place over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2932.555s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They either evacuated the building or there was a lockdown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2935.476s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What's the difference between the two?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2937.197s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Needs to be explained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2938.457s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Does a lockdown complete the service of saying that the school is safe or not?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2942.839s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2944.62s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But this forum, this is the only forum that you have this opportunity to let the people come and have their opportunity to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2952.477s">[Robert Penta]</a>: about what is happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2954.358s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now we talk about transparency and the public relations person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2959.902s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where has all that been going?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2961.623s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where's the public relations coming out on this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2964.145s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if it truly has been eight days after the fact, why are you having a meeting eight days after the fact if in fact the consultation took place between the school administration<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2974.455s">[Robert Penta]</a>: the state police, and the area surrounding police departments to find out the protocol, whether it's high level, low level, or no level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2982.038s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Who are they to make that decision?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2984.358s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The school committee, the school department should have some type of an ember alert that addresses itself, like they do when they come out to mass, when a child disappears, or a senior citizen is missing, or a person in general is missing, for whatever the reasons might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2998.3s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, we're living in a day and age today that is not the same as 1950, 60, 70.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3002.846s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not even the same as it was five years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3005.789s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're living in a world that's talentious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3007.752s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's crazy with people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3009.454s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it has a deep concern that everyone's child that goes to a school should be considered to be safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3015.441s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and in a safe place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3017.002s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But when you're talking about something like this tonight, it's not in a safe place because the protocols weren't met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3023.524s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if the protocols aren't being met, then there is something wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3026.546s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's a breakdown in the system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3028.346s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's why we're paying a superintendent in excess of $160,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3031.227s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have two assistant superintendents, well in excess of $120,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3035.029s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They have a responsibility to this community, whether it's your kids, my kids, grandchildren, or someone else's children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3043.332s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's to ensure that when they go to that school, barring any unforeseen circumstance, and if something were to happen, the parent should be advised ASAP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3053.074s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I wouldn't want a superintendent or a teacher to say whether they make the decision whether my child should be there or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3059.436s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's kind of like interesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3060.836s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you follow the whole idea about testing and MCAS and everything else and Common Core and draw the correlation to it, if the child or the parent doesn't want the kid to take it, they can opt out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3072.829s">[Robert Penta]</a>: magnify that to a bomb threat in a building and not tell the parent for eight hours after the fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3079.673s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There is no correlation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3081.253s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There is no justice to this whole thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3083.475s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And whatever comes out of this meeting tomorrow night, I hope it just proves one thing that those who were responsible, who didn't do their job are charged for not doing their job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3093.059s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're replaced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3093.98s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And we have a system in place that you don't have to have this type of a conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3098.322s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I applaud you, Councilor Longo, for bringing this forward because this gets to the very heart of the citizens of Medford, its children, its core, its future for tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3107.75s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1206.822s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1207.603s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Penter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1208.524s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I live at Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1211.358s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Last week we had a conversation regarding these, this position and the issue as it relates to, um, since we're talking about the chief of staff position right now, um, the concern that a chief of staff would have, especially as it relates to the working operation, not only of the mayor's office, but the interaction of all department heads and employees here in the city of Medford and outside concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1231.969s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What bothers me on this particular matter right now is that this position, which became effective on January 4th of this year,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1238.92s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Um, since it's a title to position and it's a compensated position in a, in a CAF, um, category, um, you're approving it now tonight, but it's been operative, uh, since January 4th of this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1250.888s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Uh, last week, um, I brought up the issue and I don't see any, unless you guys and ladies have a paper on your agenda here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1258.412s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Uh, the relative to the fact that our city auditor has been asked to also, um, entertain doing the duties of the treasurer collector.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1266.548s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And from last week to this week, I've consulted with the division of local services and the department of revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1272.01s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's absolutely, you cannot do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1274.571s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The city auditor cannot do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1276.152s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a, it's a prerogative and it's a concern of chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1281.294s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's an issue that a chief of staff would look into.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1285.396s">[Robert Penta]</a>: With due respect to the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1288.217s">[Robert Penta]</a>: With due respect, Mr. President, the chief of staff is an advisor, is an advisor to the mayor of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1294.11s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the advice to the mayor of the community over and beyond legal advice would be whether this is an allowable or whether it's allowable or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1302.274s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's no case law and there is no state statute that allows whether it be temporary or what have you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1308.297s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as a result of that, I think it's something that needs to be addressed because the chief of staff who's been operating since January 4th of this year, it's obvious that that information either has been given to the incumbent mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1320.204s">[Robert Penta]</a>: or the president administration just refuses to, um, abide by it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1324.867s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The law is also quite succinct in its, um, in its review that under chapter 41, section 52, all accounts are rendered to be kept in the departments of any city shall be subject to the inspection of the city auditor or officer having similar duties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1341.418s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So we know now on the chapter 41, section 52, that that's the auditor's position as it relates to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1347.002s">[Robert Penta]</a>: not being allowed to do any other position in the department, I mean, in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1351.485s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And chapter 41, section 55 clearly delineates the fact that the town accountant shall be sworn to the faithful performance of his duties, shall hold no other town office involving the receipt or disbursement of monies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1364.755s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you've already had a chief of staff since January 5th of this year, that is a known fact that should not be allowed to take place, temporary or otherwise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1373.501s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There is nothing in state law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1374.862s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There is no state statute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1376.379s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and there is no case law that allows this to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1379.12s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The only exemption to the rule is- We have before us- Pardon me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1381.901s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have before us, sir- We're talking about the chief of staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1383.822s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The chief of staff position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1386.643s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's one of the duties that a chief of staff does, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1398.368s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe the city solicitor was here last week, and in our conversation he did acknowledge the fact that there is no case law, number one, and there is no<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1405.883s">[Robert Penta]</a>: state statute that allows it for temporary or otherwise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1409.305s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He's here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1410.426s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He can stand on his own two feet to say it, but I think the OR is quite succinct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1414.028s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But more importantly, it's the position of the chief of staff, and they should know this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1417.89s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this new administration should not be going into a territory knowing that it's in violation of state statute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1424.414s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, the unfortunate part about this whole issue right now is that you have a city solicitor that represents the mayor, that represents the city council, that represents the board of appeals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1433.139s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if there's a difference of opinion as to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1435.414s">[Robert Penta]</a>: who should prevail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1437.014s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's quite obvious if the council needs to have a question answered, you still haven't gotten that answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1441.755s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think you are entitled to have that answer legally, right, wrong, or indifferent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1446.617s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I stand here, and I'll be willing to be corrected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1449.197s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But for my information that I've been able to ascertain, and now speaking with the Division of Local Services at the Department of Revenue, you cannot do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1456.559s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the law is quite succinct on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1458.326s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That is a prerogative, and that's a detailed description that a chief of staff does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1462.651s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They are the advisor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1464.413s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They are the advisor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1465.454s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if their advice to the present administration was not consulted with the city's law department, well, that's a mistake there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1472.842s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if the law department is basically saying this— Point of information, Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1516.458s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On the motion for approval by Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1518.319s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, no one is standing here to interrupt the appointment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1521.802s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The fact of the matter is that that person has been in the position since January 4th of this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1526.306s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So all you're doing is finalizing something that was initiated on January 4th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1530.629s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The person is in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1532.048s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The papers have already gone out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1533.368s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The individual is signing off as chief of staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1535.549s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So it's already a done deal, so to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1537.95s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this council deserves to have, within its own bailiwick of information, the fact whether this is right or wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1543.952s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because if this council is just going to sit there, it would ignore the fact that a city auditor is also assuming the position as a treasurer collector, when you know that there was a young lady, Judy Johnson, who's worked very hard, very capable to be that person, to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1557.516s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why is that not happening?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1559.737s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1561.019s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The ball's in your court.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1561.88s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You folks can do what you want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1563.401s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But this isn't a good message sending out to the people of this community, that you have a present administration that's potentially working with the conflict of interest and in violation of the law by having one person, the city auditor, assume two positions, that and that of the treasurer-collector, when you have a qualified person downstairs in that office that could do the job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1581.354s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1582.135s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, I'd like to ask you, Mr. President, is the city council going to request<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1585.73s">[Robert Penta]</a>: a legal opinion on that because I think it's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1588.191s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As a citizen, I'd like to ask one of my colleagues to make that request to the city administration, whether Mrs. Baker on the chapter 41, chapter 41, section 55 is entitled to be the city and the town treasurer at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1612.054s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, with all due respect to my colleague, he knows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1657.528s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1663.61s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can take a roll call vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1664.67s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, you can take a vote on it or what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1665.911s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yeah, we'll take a vote on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3243.293s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Please state your name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3245.014s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3245.415s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My name is Robert Penter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3246.515s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I live at Zero Summit Road in Massachusetts, and I think we're in an area right now where we have a unique opportunity to really look at what our audiences are saying and where we can be going, because if we're going to relegate ourselves to changing audiences, maybe we should just look at the total picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3262.665s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The total picture revolves itself around to the victor goes to spoils, and I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3267.743s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But rather than change our municipal ordinance or any ordinance, maybe we ought to take advantage of what the law already allows for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3275.546s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The new administration does have a unique opportunity to hire any individual he or she would like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3281.768s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 4, Section 7, Sixth A, allows for coterminous appointments that would exist to that of the mayor in this particular situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3294.763s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what would happen there, that the individual who would be appointed would not be subject to any municipal ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3301.408s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They would just be subject to this particular law, which happens to be state statute, and every person that's in the mayor's office, which is an administrative appointment, would find itself in a co-terminus position as it relates to the term that the mayor sits in that office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3316.598s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If, in fact, a new mayor were to come in in the future, the person sitting in that position would then be reviewed<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3322.505s">[Robert Penta]</a>: at a subsequent time by the then new mayor for the purposes of whether they continue to be coterminous or whether in fact they are going to be eliminated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3331.587s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They would come under the same privileges of having a review to their job, their job application, and what have you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3337.768s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The second portion that you would have to look at is these individuals are serving at an at-will position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3345.165s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The mayor chooses individuals to work in that particular office, his or her office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3349.65s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And by looking at having that person sit in that particular office, you have to take into consideration the fact that are we putting people in there because of a municipal ordinance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3360.302s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Are we putting people in there because it's going to be coterminous?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3362.704s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Are we putting those people in there because they're at will?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3365.928s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, if you look at all the state rules and laws and regulations as it relates to at-will contracts, you can have these made in such a way that you can fire them and hire them anytime they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3375.555s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They can leave anytime they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3376.856s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can have an employment contract that basically relegates what their terms and duties are in this particular office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3382.801s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And to do that, that sets the tempo of making sure that you do have and you have hired the right person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3388.865s">[Robert Penta]</a>: For example, you might hire somebody and the person just doesn't work out six, seven months down the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3394.249s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then what are you going to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3395.729s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you stick with the municipal ordinance the way it is, you're not going to have the same luxury of either an at-will or a coterminous type of an individual, because that way the other review factor would be part and parcel of what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3408.134s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Second of all, and more importantly, whether it's this position or any other position, you have to look at the conflict of interest issue that revolves around the people in this particular case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3417.997s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In this particular case, you already have one individual that's working in the office, I believe it was on or about January,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3425.547s">[Robert Penta]</a>: in January, early January, and this individual also happens to be on the, on the transition team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3432.372s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, being on a transition team and also getting paid by the city of Medford for being an individual working in the mayor's office right now, I think presents itself, Mr. Solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3442.22s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I asked the question, I begged the question, so to speak, is there a conflict of interest?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3446.604s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because the impartiality of a transition team is supposed to bring the recommendations<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3450.89s">[Robert Penta]</a>: to the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3452.23s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But when you're getting paid by the administration, and you're also on this transition team, you're also, I think, if you look under the conflict of interest law, you're possibly looking or possibly indicating that there could be a conflict, there might be a conflict, or it could appear to be a conflict.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3466.453s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And really, that's what you don't want right now, especially starting off with a brand new administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3471.194s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I would suggest to my colleagues, as you review this thing in your committee of the whole, that you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3477.083s">[Robert Penta]</a>: look into this thing a little bit further, over and beyond changing a municipal ordinance or adding or subtracting to it, and look at the term that's allowed by state statute under the term of being either coterminous or at-will employees, because your responsibility back to the taxpayers is not the same as that of the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3494.672s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you appropriate money for those particular positions, the question then becomes, after that appropriation, you have absolutely no control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3502.536s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You'll have absolutely no control over that employee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3505.093s">[Robert Penta]</a>: other than the chief executive officer making the final decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3508.295s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if you want to ask the hard questions, this is the time to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3511.717s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you do have options, and your options are either serve coterminously, number one, at will, number two, and more importantly, I think you really need to look at the conflict of interest that presently exists in the office, because I don't think it's right that someone who's on the transition team at the same time is getting paid well in excess of $90,000 to sit in the mayor's office at the present time and take on another job and duty and responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3533.608s">[Robert Penta]</a>: the same job and duty of responsibility that will come up in the next issue that's going to be presented before you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3539.43s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'll be more than happy to answer any questions, but I just think you really need to look at this thing more in its totality as to what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3545.713s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I really think Councilor Lungo-Koehn is right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3548.174s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think you need a listing of every single person, their job classification, who they're replacing, and more importantly, what's the difference in the salaries, because that's going to make a big difference as to why are we making these changes at all and for what reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3561.113s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think you deserve that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3562.114s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's what transparency is all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3564.215s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you should not be afraid to ask the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3566.316s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's the taxpayer's money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3568.257s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's your duty and responsibility, as it was mine when I was sitting on that side, to make sure that the money was accounted for properly and appropriately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3576.181s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So that's it, if anyone wants to ask any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4441.418s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Watch the button there, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4442.378s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4442.998s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Bob Penta, 07 Road Method Mask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4445.219s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'd just like to bring your attention to the number F section over there, where it says report to the director of finance auditing on matters that pertain to procurement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4454.441s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On January 5th of this year, the city administration appointed Ann Baker to also be the city treasurer, beside being the city auditor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4462.602s">[Robert Penta]</a>: She can't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4463.443s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's illegal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4464.003s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's against the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4465.601s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and I don't even know why she's being allowed to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4469.023s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The second section of the law is very specific as it relates to where we're going on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4473.825s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Chapter 41, section 52 states that all accounts are rendered to be kept in the departments of the city shall be subject to the inspection of the city auditor or officer having similar duties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4486.231s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, the term city auditor and town auditor is interchangeable under our state statute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4491.073s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then you go to chapter 41, section 55, and it's clear as a bell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4495.75s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The town accountant shall be sworn to the faithful performance of his duties, shall hold no other town office involving the receipt or disbursement of monies."<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4505.133s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So, I don't know where you're going with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4507.693s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think Mr. Solicitor, you need to look at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4509.534s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I could be wrong, but the way I read that, your town auditor or your city auditor, which is Ann Baker, is also now, as of January 5th, the city's tax collector.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4519.176s">[Robert Penta]</a>: She can hold both those positions, a direct conflict of law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4522.448s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Uh, it's conflict of interest, excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4524.269s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the law is very specific, especially chapter 41, section 55.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4527.931s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think a committee of the whole is so important to understand all the ramifications, you know, what this is all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4535.135s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Um, you, as I said before, you have a lady that's a come on board from the transition team at $106,000 a year, um, as the director of budget and personnel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4545.901s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's what her title is, unless that's going to change in the future, what have you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4549.866s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These are issues that I think the council needs to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4551.947s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think you need to know all the names, the dollar amounts, and wherever you're going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4555.589s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the conflicts that possibly and potentially arise, and this is one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4559.311s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's as clear as a bell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4560.472s">[Robert Penta]</a>: She got appointed in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4562.033s">[Robert Penta]</a>: She is our city auditor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4563.854s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And apparently, she's going to be the city treasurer for another 60 days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4567.476s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can't do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4568.777s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The law is specific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4569.757s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not me saying it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4571.038s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4571.558s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You only can serve one master.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4572.739s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You only can serve one position at one time, especially in the city or town.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4577.233s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And with all due respect, I just think before you guys just jump in, ladies, before you jump into this thing, I think you really need to understand the full ramifications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4585.079s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Not only that, but the background of the individuals that are accepting these positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4589.722s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Again, the mayor, whoever he or she might be, has that privilege of hiring whoever they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4595.586s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if there's a potential conflict, that needs to be addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4599.208s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then if there's also a possibility that, I'm not saying take the job out of a classification, I'm saying take the job out of a time sequence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4606.929s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and make it run coterminous with the mayor, whether it's a CAF 14, 18, 22, whatever it might be, as it designated to the terminology, chief of staff, secretary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4616.394s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I've got no problem with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4617.794s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's not the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4618.575s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The real issue is the person that's being hired, whether it's at will or whether it's coterminous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4623.677s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But more importantly, in this particular case, I think it needs to be addressed immediately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4627.919s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Ann Bega cannot be the city auditor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4629.84s">[Robert Penta]</a>: She cannot be the city's tax collector at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4632.982s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The law is specific, chapter 41, section 55,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4636.213s">[Robert Penta]</a>: says it, I don't say it, and I would expect that the city takes the appropriate action on that matter, just to make sure that they don't get themselves in any kind of a quandary as a conflict that possibly could exist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4647.637s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4873.568s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4875.208s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4875.808s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, I would like to make a response since the city solicitor challenged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4881.089s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Point of order, Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4934.881s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'll address my comments back to the City Council so we don't have to have a discourse back and forth between my friend, the City Solicitor, and myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4942.685s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If he wanted to take that one step further as to what I said, I didn't say it was illegal, I said it has potential for conflict of interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4948.948s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And Councilman Marks is absolutely right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4950.849s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If there is at present an Assistant City, what's her name, Treasurer, no, Mrs. Baker, an Assistant, there's two Assistants in both of those offices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4963.562s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Whether it's Ann Baker as the auditor or Fred Pompeo's office as an assistant, they both have two capable individuals that could assume either one of those roles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4971.571s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And my argument is, and it's very specific in here, I have a difference of opinion with my city solicitor friend, whether either one of those two assistants assume the position, but making one person assume both of them when you have other people just as capable<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4985.486s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and able to do the job presents and begs the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4988.668s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's what the issue is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4990.189s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How's the checks and balances going to take place?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4992.711s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A city auditor is supposed to be the checks and balances as to how and when the city spends its money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4998.195s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if the city auditor wants to challenge, you know, what the treasurer-collector has done in the past, which has been her job, now that person is assuming both those positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5008.302s">[Robert Penta]</a>: She will have a conflict between herself as to what role am I supposed to play, the auditor or the treasurer-collector?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5015.207s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that makes no sense at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5016.788s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And especially since you have the personnel that are in this building, well qualified, work their way up to the ranks, they should be given that opportunity rather than even get into this discourse that we're having right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5027.396s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what begs the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5028.957s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why are we even discussing this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5030.278s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There is no need for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5031.859s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have people in this building, they're getting paid, they've been trained, and they do their job well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5037.343s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But to take one person and put it in charge of two, which is the checks and balance person, how do you checks and balance yourself?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5045.234s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That doesn't make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5047.415s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The law is very specific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5049.475s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You only can serve one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5051.276s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And whether it's temporary or not temporary, we're not at that juncture of the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5055.657s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where we are right now is the fact that you have personnel that are capable and able of doing the position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5062.399s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's what you should be talking about, and that's what should be being addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5066.301s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Not one person assuming two positions and scratching their head and saying, what would happen if something were to happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5073.203s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7559.108s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7561.11s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Sir?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7561.29s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'd like to speak about... Please state your name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7564.252s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Bob Henton from Zero Summit Road, Medford, Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7565.774s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'd like to speak about the contract in one particular area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7568.956s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you go back and look at the contract and look at the proposal that was made, we were talking at one point in time of possibly having zones here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7576.443s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And to date, there are no zones, and none of the METAs are identified as being in any particular zone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7582.707s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7583.147s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Rodriguez just got through saying, during this past month of December, people were putting money in the METAs, and the METAs were accepting them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7591.452s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think the question needs to go a little bit further to the Park-Metford office to find out what their technology is, because they should be able to shut down that meter that indicates that they will not accept the money on any particular day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7603.341s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As far as the new meters in downtown Metford Square, I think Councilor Caraviello can attest to this, because I think he was a product of it, putting the money in the meter, and the meter did take the money in Metford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7615.27s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you have situations here that even where you have the pay park ones, and now you have the stanchions<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7621.321s">[Robert Penta]</a>: where you put the quarters in, there are some problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7624.003s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it would behoove the council not only to have your first annual update, Councilor Caraviello, as you were talking about, maybe to have them come in here and find out, especially with two new councillors, what your concerns might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7634.01s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They indicated that they have all this technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7636.872s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They have this computer app technology and whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7640.835s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But there definitely are concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7642.276s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There are people still getting tagged for no reason at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7645.678s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And more importantly, there are no zones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7647.379s">[Robert Penta]</a>: City of Boston is very clear<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7649.257s">[Robert Penta]</a>: on how they address their issue relative toward their parking and their meters, their zones and their territories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7655.219s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It would be very easy to put zone locations on each and every one of the meters and each and every one of the, you know, it doesn't take a lot to put, you know, the number, whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7664.863s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you don't have to go through the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7667.123s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And on Christmas Eve day, Christmas Eve day in the afternoon, people were getting tickets right up until six o'clock at night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7674.566s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think that's just a little bit disingenuous, as I said before,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7678.072s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're nothing but a bunch of bounty hunters coming here to Boston and Medford, Massachusetts, to get as much money as they can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7684.734s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's just not working out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7686.335s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And with the two new councils on here, I would hope that they would be brought up to date that the past council, the very past one in December, voted seven to nothing to give the senior citizens in the city of Medford the break of not being able to pay, because that was one of the concerns that was attributed by the president administration that they would do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7704.602s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I think it's an issue that needs to be addressed, and I think it's an issue<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7708.332s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that should work well for the City of Medford, especially for the seniors in our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7712.513s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=597.462s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why couldn't that money be incorporated as part of the office of community development who was desperately in need of folks to have a professional consultant come in as we talked about before?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=607.155s">[Robert Penta]</a>: just taking $250,000 and spending it randomly at five squares doesn't make as much sense as having a paid professional and here's where the money could come from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=616.041s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It would even have to come out of the city's budget and you would have a working operating capital to work with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=620.985s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, the city is in desperate need of getting good professional people and I think this would be a better way to spend the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=627.669s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If I would use the money to be spent, that's what I would go because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=630.622s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You need a professional person who's going to be able to tell you what's wrong, why these squares are not multiplying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=635.828s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Just to correct the sidewalk or plant a tree or do a window or put a facade, that doesn't still help the business district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=641.695s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think what you really need is a hardcore look and a reality check as to why these businesses aren't multiplying or doing as good as they should.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=649.275s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I would like to amend this to go one step further that that money be considered for the purposes of having a paid professional consultant be incorporated into the office of community development for the purposes of business development for the entire five squares in the city of method.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=697.125s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, when this first came up, Mr. President, when they were talking about the $250,000 and there wasn't a definition on how this money was going to be spent, there was nothing that required the fact<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=706.337s">[Robert Penta]</a>: you know, you couldn't use it for salaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=707.778s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now you're putting a requirement on it that wasn't there in the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=711.101s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that right there in and of itself is just, you know, it's, it's stifling the whole idea of moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=717.847s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why can't this money just be put on hold until next year and then incorporate into next year's budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=722.571s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If it's an, if it's an, if you're telling me if it's into the real estate account, why can't it just go into the real estate account and become effective January 1st when the city council, the then city council can make its recommendation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=747.975s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But why is it going into the real estate account?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=749.836s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why can't it go to free cash?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=757.879s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is being, where does it say that Louise?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=762.502s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's a 250 has to go into the real estate account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=771.627s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But that doesn't mean that the council can make a subsequent request to send it to free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=776.029s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would move amend the motion that it'd be sent to free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=778.231s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That way the, the incoming council can have a better intelligent way of learning how to spend the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3841.056s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I could tell you many stories about Paul Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3845.343s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I first met Paul when he drove up to my house many, many years ago before he decided to run for school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3850.09s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And from that point on,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3852.113s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It became a relationship.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3853.855s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He should really be working for the city in charge of constituent service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3856.978s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because I think he really likes going out there and taking care of people's concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3860.842s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because he's like myself, he's a lover of government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3862.664s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I like government in a different way than he likes it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3865.006s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the interesting part about Paul Camuso, he has made my life extremely interesting for the last 16 years in this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3872.077s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because if it wasn't for him, a lot of these issues really would never be magnified to the point that they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3877.281s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Whether you were a supporter or a proponent for the mayor or not or vice versa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3881.264s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He made it very interesting because sometimes that's what you really need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3884.006s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You need this discourse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3885.066s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You need this difference of opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3886.628s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And when you have a difference of opinion, that's when you learn sometimes what the issue is about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3890.532s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And when the issue is being presented sometimes, you just lose concept of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3894.173s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But Paul and I, I believe we've had many, many differences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3897.694s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But as he has said, at the end of the night, he'll come over and shake your hand, or I'll go over and talk to him, shake his hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3902.335s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's just an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3903.015s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's all that it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3903.915s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you move on from the subject matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3906.215s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what's really interesting here, there's three people here that were, you people were that young when they first started?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3912.937s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't believe it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3914.947s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I'm not that old, so that's the point, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3919.771s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I want to wish you good luck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3921.373s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Like him, I don't think he's going away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3923.014s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He'll be around, and he's just taking a pause in life, and that's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3926.377s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And sometimes you need to do that to refine yourself and get yourself back in action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3930.661s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I congratulate you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3931.742s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Enjoy your life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3932.302s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Enjoy your wife and your family, because that's what it's really about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3934.945s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The first thing in life is your family, and that's what you take care of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3938.308s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Good luck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4125.26s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, I had a big speech prepared, but the first thing I'm going to say, I'm not retiring, and I'm not going to Florida.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4131.462s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm staying right here in the city of Medford, all right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4141.646s">[Robert Penta]</a>: First of all, and more importantly, you know, I was getting a little emotional sitting over there, and I was at a point maybe getting a little teary-eyed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4149.508s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you know something?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4150.549s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm not going to do that tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4152.749s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Tonight, this is a congratulatory night for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4155.867s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I am so thankful that I have had an opportunity for serving in government for 36 years that was never once questioned as it relates to who or what I was about and why I was doing what I did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4171.334s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I did it for one particular reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4173.115s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I was elected by the people of this community to represent them to the best of my ability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4177.868s">[Robert Penta]</a>: not for any personal, financial, or family gain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4181.251s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I did this for one reason, because you, the people, are the most important people in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4185.635s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's why you elect folks like us, to be here and to do your business and to represent your finances, your education, and your wherewithal to the best of my ability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4195.764s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When I first ran for office in 1974, I ran for state representative and I got elected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4200.688s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There was a lady that I met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4202.955s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And she happened to turn out to be the first woman mayor of the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4205.917s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Her name was Marilyn Catino Perica.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4208.298s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And she gave me... She gave me a guidepost that I used in this very past election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4217.985s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It basically was, true leadership is found in the plan that one has to offer for respectful consideration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4224.909s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As we all know, I did not run for re-election to the Medford City Council this past year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4229.832s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I ran for the office of mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4232.0s">[Robert Penta]</a>: At the outset, I want to thank Anthony D'Antonio, because four years ago, he broke the ice, saying in this community, someone can run against the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4240.547s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No one is invincible, no one owns the job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4243.369s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Unfortunately, he didn't make it, but he tried, and he got 36% of the vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4247.273s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's a huge number to get, coming out of the box for the very first time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4251.836s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I decided to run for this job this past time, only for one reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4256.79s">[Robert Penta]</a>: to present a plan, a plan that would give you a vision, a plan that would give you an opportunity, and a plan that would tell you how your taxes and how your buildings and how your educational system would work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4267.859s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I have to thank my wife, Susan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4271.402s">[Robert Penta]</a>: She was the campaign manager to my campaign, and you know, I don't know why, she never was involved in politics before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4278.167s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I needed and wanted someone who could talk to me and relate to the, as the person on the street,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4283.681s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and you can't say this, and this is what you should be doing, and how do we make this connection work?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4288.963s">[Robert Penta]</a>: She stabilized me during this campaign, because everyone knows, at the drop of a dime, I could lose it, and I have, and I have, and I'll admit it, and I have, and I have probably at council meetings in the past through the years, and that's only because of my passion for the job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4303.127s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's not because of any hate for or against any one person or any one issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4307.698s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, the one thing this community really has to figure out, and with all due respect to the incoming administration, this election was not a landslide victory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4316.064s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So there's a lot of work to be done here to make this city go in the right direction and to bring people together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4323.269s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And to bring people together, there has to be an understanding that folks need to be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4327.933s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And how do you get involved?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4328.853s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You need to speak up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4329.794s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You come to that podium on a Tuesday night or whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4333.877s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I will assure you of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4336.297s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I may be sitting there now up until January 4th, but I'll be behind that rail after January 4th, because if I think there's something... Because if I believe that there is something of major importance to our community, no voice should be stifled, past, present, or the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4363.619s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because that's what it's all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4364.861s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm 71 years old, and I'm proud of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4366.983s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I'm not old.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4368.024s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm not going to sit in a rocking chair, and I'm not going away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4378.137s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Two particular points I want to bring up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4380.179s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think it definitely needs to be cleared up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4382.795s">[Robert Penta]</a>: because it was misdirected during this past campaign for mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4387.6s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I was never against new schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4389.903s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What I was against was the opportunity for the people of Medford to have voted for new schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4394.468s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4395.689s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Number two, you were taking away your community schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4398.192s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So when we went to 14 schools down to four, that was a huge change in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4402.974s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And a lot of people did not have their input into that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4406.256s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as a result of that, and the reason why we built new schools at that point in time, some 15 years ago, was the schools were becoming run down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4414.12s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They were becoming misused or not used correctly, and they needed a lot of repairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4419.282s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, here we are now, some 15 years later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4422.483s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Rick Caviale, on his first year on the term, that's four years ago, that would have made it 11 years ago, produced a paper that said the new schools are $1,102,000 in repairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4433.826s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're right back to where we were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4435.487s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's why we built the new schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4437.267s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There is the need to making sure that the new council, the new school committee stays on top of their buildings, because look right up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4443.929s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's almost three years old.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4446.17s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Three years old, and the city has yet to fix that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4448.972s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the superintendent of schools was sitting right over there when that ceiling fell, and it still hasn't been fixed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4454.736s">[Robert Penta]</a>: People, you've got to be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4456.237s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You need to stay involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4458.559s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, I'm over this feeling right now of being sad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4461.741s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm not sad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4463.483s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm glad because I have created a new family for myself, a family of people not only who believe, but they need and they want the change to take place in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4472.669s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They don't want it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4484.613s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, this past election presented an awful lot of opportunities for everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4488.455s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Opportunities for people to write for or write against.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4490.736s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Whether you liked me or didn't like me, whether you liked my opponent, whether you liked my Councilors or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4495.039s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have two brand new Councilors, you have two brand new school committee people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4497.56s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That in and of itself should open up big doors for the people in this community who want to see how and where their election process is going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4505.925s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And do they vote for the right people?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4508.514s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The only way you're gonna find out if you vote for the right people, don't wait for two years and wait for the campaign literature to come out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4514.237s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Watch, as I will, each and every week and each and every month, what's taking place on the school committee, what's taking place at the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4520.961s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you don't like it, speak up, I'll call your council, I'll call your school committee person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4525.023s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You just can't be a lump in the log and say, I'm against it, I don't like it, you need to speak up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4530.367s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And people did speak up in this last election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4532.668s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Unfortunately, it was a beautiful day, only 38% of the people came out to vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4536.772s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Hopefully, I think on both sides, everybody would have thought more people would have come out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4539.955s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But they didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4540.975s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the 38 percent, they spoke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4543.137s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was close, and I think we'll all acknowledge the fact it was close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4546.059s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So there's no mandate one way or the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4547.64s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But there is one mandate, and that's this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4549.702s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think the people of this community expect the elected politicians to do their job on behalf of the people of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4555.346s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's what I did for 36 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4557.448s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I did my job, and I'm proud of the fact that I did do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4573.173s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, there's always people during the campaign that you want to acknowledge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4577.296s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And there's so many.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4578.217s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I could look at this entire audience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4580.138s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But to me, he's my unsung hero in each and every one of my campaigns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4583.601s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Whenever I ask him to do anything, he just does it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4585.743s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And there's no questions asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4587.064s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's my brother, Anthony.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4588.165s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I have to publicly acknowledge him, because that's what he is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4599.293s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I just caught her eye in the back of the room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4601.681s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I want to publicly acknowledge you, Nancy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4603.922s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You came here on behalf of the Perica family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4606.903s">[Robert Penta]</a>: She and her family stood out at the polls for me on Election Day because they believed in me, and I thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4612.466s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Nancy Perica.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4623.551s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, we could go on and on with stories here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4626.152s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the second thing, I told you about the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4628.473s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the second thing are the kiosks here in the square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4631.423s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As you all know, I'm just dead set against them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4633.164s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't think they're working right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4634.344s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't think they, I don't think that, you know, you know, there's, there's a resolution on the council agenda here tonight and it reflects upon the fact that during this past campaign, my opponent put out a questionnaire as it relates to senior citizens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4647.41s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Should they be allowed to park for nothing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4649.191s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Not only do I support that, if we're going to tweak it, then let it be tweaked and give some benefit back to this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4654.694s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I would hope that this city council holds the president administration<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4658.462s">[Robert Penta]</a>: feet to the fire by telling the Republic parking people that seniors do not have to park here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4662.905s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's bad enough that you get taxed for everything else, and 45 percent of this community is made up of seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4667.628s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Give them a break, folks, because you get the water, you get the meals tax, you get the hotel tax, and you get your real estate tax, and anything else you want to talk about just keeps going up in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4677.034s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And while everything keeps going up in this community, salaries have not gotten up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4681.176s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Everyone that works in this building works for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4683.718s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Your taxpaying dollars pay for everyone's job in this particular building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4687.693s">[Robert Penta]</a>: To get your biggest bank for the buck, let them work for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4690.455s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that would be an easy way to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4691.796s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Remember, this republic company is here for 10 years, and you've got no control over it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4695.878s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the one thing you have control over is the people who signed off on that contract, and they have a right to go there and negotiate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4702.123s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And when my opposition turn around and put that out there, and that's one thing I would be supportive of, that senior citizens of this city park for nothing in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4710.168s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They don't deserve to pay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4718.652s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When I mention my wife Susan, you have to understand something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4722.315s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As much as a novice she is, she's been an educator for 23 years as a retired school teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4727.619s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So she knows what English, the language is all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4730.441s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Sometimes when I talk too fast, I say the wrong words.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4733.204s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It just doesn't come out right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4735.205s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And she says, you can't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4736.306s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can't say that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4737.787s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I am blessed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4739.929s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, Paul sort of like hit it on the head.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4742.571s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I've been blessed with two women in my life and two families in my life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4749.478s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I am a very lucky man.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4750.539s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I am very thankful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4753.902s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I didn't lose an election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4754.882s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know what I won?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4756.223s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I won the people of the city of Medford who believed in Bob Penta because I believe in you folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4761.468s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And with that being said, I want to conclude by saying the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4764.79s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My friend, Jimmy DeVito, you'll understand this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4767.673s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In 1942, it was General Douglas MacArthur who had to leave the Philippine Islands because at the Battle of Bataan, they got beaten up pretty bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4777.721s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And he was supposed to be taking a submarine to leave the islands, because eventually he had to get to Australia.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4784.222s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But he decided not to take that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4785.823s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He decided to take a PT boat and go up in the middle of the night to beat the Japanese at that point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4791.184s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And unfortunately, they ran into inclement weather on the whole nine yards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4795.005s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So as a result of that, he was one of the two days in the water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4798.306s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He was in open water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4800.364s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But he was very lucky, because there was no Japanese boat that saw him traversing that water, getting to where he had to go to, in Mindanao.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4811.328s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Two days later, when he finally landed there, he made a very famous speech.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4816.009s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And when he made that speech, it was in Melbourne, Australia.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4819.25s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this is what he said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4820.891s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is his declaratory lines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4822.311s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He says, I came through, and I shall return.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4827.806s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I took those lines and he says, how can I make that work for me tonight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4832.49s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So this is what I said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4834.772s">[Robert Penta]</a>: With that said, and with a Penta on the city ballots for the past 38 years, stay tuned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4841.417s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And while there may be a Penta in a pause mode, there will be a Penta to be continued in our days ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4864.138s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I thank you, my family, my friends, and even those folks who don't like me or didn't vote for me, because you know why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4870.082s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You expressed your opinion, and I'm okay with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4872.784s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And for all those who've supported me in my positions through the years, and may our loving and forgiving God bless all of us, and may God bless us all as he sees fit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4881.95s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Bon attab.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4882.671s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4900.016s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would be absolutely remiss if I didn't say this, because the highest thing on my scale of friendship is loyalty, and I forgot to say it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4909.163s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's one person, and I will embarrass him, he's right over there, that guy right there, Michael Marks, from the day that I announced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4924.954s">[Robert Penta]</a>: From the day that I announced, no questions asked, he stepped up, came forward,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4930.287s">[Robert Penta]</a>: over and beyond my friends, my new extended family of friends, but for an elected official to put his neck on the line, no questions asked, no wanting for anything, that to me is what it's all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4941.875s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These are my friends, you are my friends, and God bless you all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4944.717s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5034.93s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would be absolutely remiss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5037.211s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My daughter, Kim.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5038.611s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My son-in-law, Patrick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5041.152s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Aaron, my extended daughter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5047.575s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Aaron.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7849.222s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As I said earlier this evening in some of my remarks, one of the things that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7853.714s">[Robert Penta]</a>: seems to have been a concern during this past campaign was the parking in the square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7859.078s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the incoming administration over and beyond the August questionnaire that was sent out and then the commitment that was made during this past campaign and one of the debates indicated that the administration would move for a senior citizen discount with Republic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7875.267s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I would request that the council go on record to show the support for that as it relates to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7880.814s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that for which had come up as a campaign issue and a commitment made by the incoming administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7896.418s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Roll call vote, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7940.278s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, I would stick to the resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7943.24s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a separate itemized issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7944.64s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It has makes no difference as it relates to what is going to be going forward with Louise Miller or anything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7949.643s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a, it's an item that was used as a campaign issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7952.504s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was an item that was voted upon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7954.025s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was an item that was campaigned on and it was an item committed upon by the incoming administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7959.727s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So being isolated as it is and following forward with that, Mr. President, I think it would be a good way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7965.87s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and some good strength to have the incoming administration realize that the City Council supports that resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8018.214s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, unfortunately at this time of the year, individuals, some individuals get recognized for whatever their contributions might be, but there is a whole host of community folks, businesses,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8028.673s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and individuals who contribute all during the year for the purposes of helping those who are in need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8034.378s">[Robert Penta]</a>: For example, you have one of the banks in the square, without mentioning them, has an annual thing for Toys for Tots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8041.484s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have the Medford Fire Department, who has an ongoing Christmas season situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8046.408s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you have individual people who are philanthropic unto their own right, and they don't want any recognition at all, they just do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8052.453s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So, it doesn't make any difference whether you're a private business, a union, an individual, whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8057.816s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These people, to some degree, if they're watching, should know that their contributions are recognized and appreciated, and as a result of that, it's our little way of saying thank you to them for being supportive for people in need when not asked to do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8086.978s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, it happened to come up in conversation, but the fact of the matter is in this recent monthly December bill,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8092.575s">[Robert Penta]</a>: from Comcast, it'll show that it's going from $3.25 to $5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8095.696s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now that's an increase of $1.75 a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8098.996s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The city is presently sitting on over $450,000 of PEG access money, cable access monies, and as a result of that, still having no public access television here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8110.178s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the city's use of those monies to pay for salaries up at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8113.939s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it's incumbent upon the incoming city council to make a demand<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8118.097s">[Robert Penta]</a>: from the incoming administration, whether, in fact, they are going to have cable, public access, TV3, whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8124.659s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And there might be a twist to that, because I think if we have all been watching what's on the news lately, there's a movement afoot between Channel 7 to possibly take over, that for which Comcast has right now, which is Nessun, and I forget the other one, and WHCH.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8144.181s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And with that being said, there is a possibility, if in fact this merger were to go through, and I think it would be the second highest, a multi-billion dollar merger, what could possibly happen as a movement, because if NBC does buy out the franchise, Anson, that they're looking to buy out, they could possibly retrieve the cable location of TV3 that we presently have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8169.872s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and put it in a different spot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8171.253s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's okay, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8172.633s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But in the contract, on page five, it says the following, PEG's access channels, any licensee-owned channels made available by the licensee in the situation as Comcast and provided for use for the presentations of PEG access programming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8186.52s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if, in fact, if you read the contract and if you follow what's going on in the news, that if, in fact, this were to take place, there's a possibility of one or two things that ANSEN, WHCH,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8198.803s">[Robert Penta]</a>: could probably be bought out by NBC, and so wouldn't be Channel 6.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8205.688s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a side issue as it relates to the main subject matter, which is public access television, but I really think you two guys coming on as new councilors, you really have to understand that if we're going to allow public access here in the city of Medford, it needs to be worked on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8218.416s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And now, having a $1.75 increase per month on a cable access bill that people would be paying each and every month, that's approximately $60 a year,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8227.517s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's a lot of money to people, you know, you take that it's another $60 and the Community Preservation Act It's another minimum of $165 as a rate increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8236.626s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's another 7% that's going to be taking place on your water and sewer tax bills coming out So it is going to have an effect and I I would suggest mr. President this Medford City Council go into some kind of remedial<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8250.725s">[Robert Penta]</a>: a discussion as it relates to, you know, what's going on, not only with the rate increase, but, you know, how and why the city can collect this money, charge up to $5, and still not allow cable access television to go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8263.014s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You may want to bring the city solicitor on board on this one here to find out if, in fact, with the great increase, can they still allow, can they still continue to allow not having public access, whether it be on Channel 3 or any other channel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8314.97s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's a value also there, too, Mr. President, of I think it's $454 or $455 million is if WHTH goes off the year, which is sort of like a sweet pot of the deal to make this thing more attractive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8326.356s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I think the city needs to get itself involved, especially because of public access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8546.334s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The first answer is that the $450,000 that's sitting there is that's for the PEG access money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8551.498s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if, in fact, we had a public access studio, that money would go there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8555.601s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That only represents 2 percent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8557.983s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's 3 percent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8559.224s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The other 2 percent goes into the general fund, and that money is being paid for employees up at the high school, which is a real question mark because there are some questions as to whether that's even legal or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8569.751s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So 1 percent goes to the fire, 1 percent to the police, and 1 percent goes to public access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8573.914s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's the PEG money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8681.779s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, most recently in a newspaper story published by the local press on December 17th, superintendent Belson was quoted as saying that the district has saved money in multiple areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8691.501s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So far this year, he said, it is also possible that the position will be filled by an employee who already works for this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8699.35s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The position he's making reference to is the new public relations potential position that the school department is now being considering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8706.336s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I'm more concerned about his first line basically saying the district has saved money in multiple areas so far this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8711.861s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it would be important for the school committee as well as the city council to get a review back as to just what are those multiple areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8720.889s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Also, I would just like to conclude by saying the following, whether it be this or anything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8725.688s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have asked for numerous occasions, and the council in the past has voted for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8729.49s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's never taken place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8730.951s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So maybe this new school administration will take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8733.553s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But at a minimum, the city council and the school committee should meet at least twice a year for the purposes of reviewing their financial wherewithals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8739.577s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because this is kind of like a little bit disturbing, that if, in fact, we have money in multiple areas, when you have teachers there that are begging in time for school supplies, we're looking for special ed teachers, we're looking for teacher assistants in some of the schools,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8755.627s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And we're having all kinds of areas here, and whether you're for or against hiring a person at $85,000 a year to be a public relations person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8764.529s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think the first thing that needs to be considered is the teacher in the classroom, the needs of the teacher in the classroom, and the students that they have to take care of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8772.134s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I think Mr. Belson owes it to the entire community of Medford, the PTOs, the PTAs, and everything else involved, that if you have multiple areas for which the school committee should be apprised of, and if they were doing their homework, they would know where these areas and how much money there is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8786.742s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That would demand a report back to the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8789.593s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I would move, Mr. President, on a roll call vote to the superintendent report back into what areas that money's coming from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8795.714s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if it's not going to affect those areas that the money's coming out of, then what's the purpose of taking the money out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8803.756s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why aren't you using that money to fill the positions in that area?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=9396.009s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then my amendment too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=9398.651s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=9787.851s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the folks were very appreciative of the fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=9790.133s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as a result of that, I think we're all appreciative of the fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=9793.115s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it would be nice to have the chief of police down here to also make public commendation recommendations as it relates to their activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=9802.161s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So on that, I move, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=9804.062s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'd like to be invited when they come down for that one, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=82.992s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This recognition tonight is for a gentleman and his wife, Henry and Evelyn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=89.518s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're like out in the community, there are a lot of silent people that do things on behalf of other folks, not looking for any recognition, not looking for any prestige, just letting folks<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=101.053s">[Robert Penta]</a>: know that there are other people out there to help them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=103.434s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And since I've gotten to know Henry and Elephant, they're very quiet people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=107.835s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're not looking for much praise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=109.215s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're not looking for anything that basically says, hey, look at me, look what I did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=113.216s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But they fortunately got recognized this past November by ARC, a nationally recognized organization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=119.782s">[Robert Penta]</a>: group of individuals, an association for whatever the reason my name might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=124.645s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And they go out there and they help out folks who are intellectually and physically disabled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=129.849s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's not just in the city of Medford, it's in other and surrounding communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=133.792s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So it gives me great pleasure, it gives me great pleasure to make this proclamation be read publicly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=140.476s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it goes as a presentation from the Medford City Council to Henry and Evelyn Milleran.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=147.302s">[Robert Penta]</a>: in recognition for your continued support within the disability community in Medford and its surrounding communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=152.825s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Your efforts were most recently recognized at the November meeting of ARC, a nationally recognized organization that deals with the intellectual and physical disabilities of those less fortunate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=162.991s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The Medford City Council extends its deepest appreciation and gratitude for your efforts in improving the quality of life for the citizenry of Medford and all those that you have helped out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=173.016s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'd like to have the both of you come up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=174.577s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Andrea and Evelyn, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=191.147s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the interesting component about these two, they're husband and wife.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=195.371s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And so not only do they do their husband and wife team, they are a husband and wife team for these intellectual and physical disabilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=202.679s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's a great compliment to the both of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=204.701s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=455.591s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, and for those who might be watching and are interested in our public safety and our Medford Police Department, most recently there was an incident, a public health incident that took place in the Medford Police Department building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=467.658s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And unfortunately it was a backup and it was a sewage backup into the building, which has caused a huge contamination of probably the basement area where the cells are downstairs and a whole host of other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=481.005s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This city council has been advocating for the past two years that their first priority would be for a new police station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=487.75s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I in my campaign for mayor advocated that a police station would be my top priority on there as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=493.473s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What I don't understand and what I don't see is the unfortunate need that what our method police officers go through male and female on a daily basis is not being recognized and has not been recognized for the past 28 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=506.382s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The unfortunate part is simply this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=509.277s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We need a new method police station, and we need to have our public safety be brought up to par.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=513.78s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're down by at least a minimum of 10 police officers, and that's rank and file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=518.083s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's not management or captains or lieutenants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=520.124s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's just rank and file patrolmen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=521.625s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, there's a new administration coming on board, and I would hope that they're not looked at, the police department with John Desai, because maybe they didn't take the positive position in coming out and endorsing that particular person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=534.614s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the unfortunate part is, that should not be used against them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=538.103s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Our public safety right now is at an all-time low.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=541.546s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Our police cruises are at an all-time low.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=544.369s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The building itself, the evidence room, and everything else that surrounds the Medford Police Department on a daily basis is at an all-time low.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=551.636s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It needs to be addressed now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=552.977s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It cannot wait.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=554.358s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Public safety in our community cannot be put on hold, and it should not be put on hold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=558.842s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I would hope that anyone who might be watching, and anyone who has an interest in public safety,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=563.223s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And anyone who really believes that our Medford Police Department deserves better, because that's what our taxes are paying for, now is the time to come forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=570.508s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have a new administration coming on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=572.089s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have two new Councilors coming on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=573.87s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The commitment has to be made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=575.631s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The finances has to be looked out for and sought out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=578.453s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And they can be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=579.274s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Malden is a perfect example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=580.975s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're building a brand new police station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=583.256s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They already have $9 million of the $18 million they've already secured in grants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=587.699s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Medford cannot be put on hold any longer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=590.362s">[Robert Penta]</a>: in regards to its police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=592.324s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And with that being said, Mr. President, I would hope that this city council and the incoming city council holds new administration's feet to the fire to build that brand-new police station in behalf of not only the citizens of this community, but because of the public safety that is necessary and it's demanding right now on a daily basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=611.842s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All you have to do is talk to the police officers, talk to the chief of police,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=616.683s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and ask them what they think should be done as compared to what is being done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=621.064s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=653.127s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, since 2013 until now, December of 2015, it's been approximately 2 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=661.39s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And during that period of time, the city of Medford has intentionally, the city administration has intentionally taken ratepayers' money from Comcast and subsequently, since Verizon has come on board,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=671.443s">[Robert Penta]</a>: for what they call public access TV here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=674.604s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As of today, there is approximately $400,000, $450,000 sitting in the city coffers downstairs for public access television.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=684.607s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Public access television for which the mayor and its current administration has intentionally not allowed here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=692.09s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And who's at the loss of that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=693.37s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's the cable TV subscribers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=695.631s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Whether you agree or disagree with anyone running for office, no candidate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=699.922s">[Robert Penta]</a>: for this past election had the opportunity to be on public access, to have their position stated, accepted, rejected, or even looked at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=707.926s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No citizen of this community has had the opportunity to have their shows relative to sports, family events, or anything that might be educational, historical, to be put on public access television.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=718.832s">[Robert Penta]</a>: During the past two years, what the mayor did is he implemented a three-member committee person, three-member person committee, for the purposes of reviewing public access here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=728.317s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Coming up with a concocted story,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=730.165s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that at some point in time, on or before Memorial Day of 2015, we would have something ongoing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=736.768s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And we don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=737.349s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is now December 2015, almost seven months later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=741.791s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the money just keeps coming out of your cable bill each and every month from Verizon and Comcast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=748.674s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We had a public access meeting here for contract renewal with Comcast here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=754.577s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was another 10-year deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=757.139s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And no one, not one person from the city administration,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=760.087s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Not one person showed up to defend and argue on behalf of Comcast customers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=765.572s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I, along with nine other citizens, were here to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=768.634s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this isn't because we're for or against.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=771.297s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a 10-year contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=772.578s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And in today's day and age, 10-year contracts are basically unheard of, especially when technology is so far advanced and it's ever-changing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=780.625s">[Robert Penta]</a>: From California all the way to Massachusetts, there's a combination of maybe even a collage<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=787.092s">[Robert Penta]</a>: between Verizon and Comcast technicians working together, sharing their jobs together as they traverse across the country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=795.178s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And yes, there is a movement out there that maybe public access is not the way to go because between Amazon and all these other technological programs that are out there between a combination of streaming or buying on Netflix or whatever it might be, the idea is out there that the city of Medford is not having it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=813.731s">[Robert Penta]</a>: With a proposal now that seems to be languishing,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=816.642s">[Robert Penta]</a>: of possibly putting it up in the vocational school, a place that would serve no purpose, especially in the winter months that we have right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=824.445s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's dark out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=825.625s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The bus route would stop the person getting off at the bottom of the hill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=828.727s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You would have to walk up to the top of the hill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=830.527s">[Robert Penta]</a>: God knows where you would have to go into the building to get in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=833.728s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It does not serve a purpose because all this type of information on public access needs to be located in a centrally located place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=842.552s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And when you have something that's centrally located, it would bring more people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=846.645s">[Robert Penta]</a>: City of Reading, Town of Reading, perfect example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=849.507s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Not only do they have it in the downtown area, they have it on every Saturday morning at 11 o'clock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=854.051s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's open to the public, coffee and donuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=855.992s">[Robert Penta]</a>: People can come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=857.053s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They show you how to make your own program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=858.734s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They lease out, rent out their equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=861.076s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They show you how to use the equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=862.397s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They show you how to make your own programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=864.519s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I know we've had this discussion before over and over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=867.541s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the fact of the matter is when we started this discussion,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=870.379s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There was nowhere near $450,000 sitting in the coffers downstairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=875.463s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And when in fact some of that money was used to pay for salaries of three individuals up at the high school in a program out there that has nothing to do and has nothing to do by law with cable access and public TV access here in the city of Medford, and nothing's been challenged in that particular area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=890.553s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What needs to be done in this city is that you need a revolution in thought where people can turn around and say, hey, wait a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=898.193s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These are your dollars that are being taken out of your cable bill each and every month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=903.077s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's almost like coming out of your check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=905.059s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're paying for something that you're not getting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=906.9s">[Robert Penta]</a>: $450,000 is nothing to sneeze at, and you still have nothing for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=912.604s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's unfortunate that we have to talk about this thing over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=916.107s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's like the police station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=917.508s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's a problem out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=918.948s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's being discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=920.309s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It needs to be discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=921.569s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It needs to be revolutionized to the point it needs change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=926.031s">[Robert Penta]</a>: New council coming in, new administration coming in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=928.712s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I hope the change takes effect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=930.933s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the people, you, the taxpayers out there, you're paying for this each and every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=935.434s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you need to hold every one of the councils accountable, as well as the mayor, to make sure that your tax dollars, your cable bills, your water bills, anything that revolves around you paying for something in this community,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=947.363s">[Robert Penta]</a>: for a service or a tax or a bill is being accounted for and spent wisely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=951.806s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would hope, and I'll leave this as a thought rather than asking or putting the council on the spot, I would hope as a thought that the incoming city council does not allow this to continue to go on, that you come up and step up forward in demand of the new city administration, that you want cable access television here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=974.702s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what the people have paid for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=976.802s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If not, give them the $450,000 back and figure out another way to do business here because it's absolutely wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=982.566s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's almost stealing people's money and not doing what they're supposed to be doing with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=987.509s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that is just so wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=989.571s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't tell our kids when you're making them grow up, this is the way life is supposed to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=994.674s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You pay for something you're not getting or you take something that you don't deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=998.677s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's exactly what's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1000.859s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The city has taken your money that they don't deserve because they're not doing anything with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1005.041s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And at the same time,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1006.102s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're paying for something that you're not getting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1008.703s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a no-win situation for you, the ratepayers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1011.905s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So with that being said, I would hope, Mr. President, and Rick, I know next year, I'm assuming if the deal is the way the deal is supposed to be, you as the president of the council, you would be able to tell, you know, this is where we're going to go with this particular direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1026.932s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as far as that goes, Mr. President, I leave my comments as they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2909.681s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, one of the key components of public access television is taking place here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2915.665s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're allowing people—not allowing, this is the People's Forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2918.765s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're having the opportunity to come up and speak for whatever their positions might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2923.306s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But in June of 2014, a federal judge by the name of James O. Browning made a very distinct comment as it relates to people who have the opportunity to come up and speak and to give their opinions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2936.15s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what that federal judge did to this particular city was to punish, and I won't say use the word punish, was to admonish them for not allowing criticism to be made at a podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2948.637s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because as he said, criticism at a podium is an unconstitutional burden on free speech.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2954.339s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if somebody wants to come here, or a council wants to compliment, commend, or whatever it might be, or somebody wants to go to that podium and speak in such a manner, so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2962.342s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But criticism of any commentary is just as much important or is just as much a part of free speech.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2969.384s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And just as Browning indicated, and he said, limits can be placed on time and topic, but not on a speaker's opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2976.787s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And whatever the speaker feels he'd like to say, within reason, as long as it's not abusive, and it's his opinion, it needs to be allowed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2985.652s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He wrote an 89-page decision, and I'm waiting for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2988.233s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I asked for the 89-page decision on that, because that's a huge issue right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2992.636s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Freedom of speech, and allowing freedom of speech, and inclusive of freedom of speech, if there's a criticism included in there, and they're saying it, and it's done in fair commentary, it should not be excluded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3006.808s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and it should not be cut off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3007.889s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As a matter of fact, this whole decision by the judge banned a particular city council from imposing critiques on anyone who was speaking there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3017.876s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I believe it's monumental.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3019.497s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It goes back to June of 2014.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3022.619s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a federal justice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3023.599s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not even a local justice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3025.04s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a federal district court justice making his opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3028.343s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's the second time within the year 2014 that two federal judges came out<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3035.161s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and made this commentary as it relates to free speech.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3037.863s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And those who might want to critique or be critical of somebody speaking or whatever the commentary might be, as he said, quote, it's an unconstitutional burden on free speech by disallowing someone to voice their opinion, be it in a critique manner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3051.735s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3171.209s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The case was very succinct and it was not allowing people to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3175.311s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The council<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3176.534s">[Robert Penta]</a>: in its wisdom, decided council president, for whatever the reasons might be, did not allow people to make negative comments, to say anything negative at council meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3185.442s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that, in and of itself, was an unconstitutional burden on free speech.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3189.945s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Whether it was a council rule or the actions that were taking place, it found itself all the way to the Supreme Court.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3196.191s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Strike that, the Federal District Court, by Justice Browning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3199.932s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I guess a word to the wise is sufficient.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3202.353s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Whether it's a ruling or not a ruling, or just not allowing anyone, for whatever the reasons might be, not to make a commentary contrary to what was being said, it's not allowable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3212.235s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's an exercise against free speech.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3215.836s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the ruling is very succinct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3736.97s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Chair recognizes Councilor Penta.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3738.652s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On the raised crosswalks, now we just got through putting one on Winthrop Street a couple of years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3742.607s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you could drive down that street right now and go over it so that there's nothing to indicate other than a sign or a thing on a pole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3752.139s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Cars go down that street kind of like fast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3753.842s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I saw a bus the other day almost do a pretty good, pretty high jump going over that speed bump.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3759.349s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maybe they should paint that thing yellow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3761.722s">[Robert Penta]</a>: with that special paint, so to let people know that there is a speed bump that they're approaching.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3765.423s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because if you're driving down the street on any given day, and if anybody knows anything about Winthrop Street, when the sun is out in the morning, it's very, very hard to differentiate how the road is coming and the traffic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3775.606s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's all enough, it's public safety going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3777.867s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I would make a suggestion that that public, that speed bump, or what do you call it, the raised sidewalk, be painted in yellow, bright iridescent yellow, so people realize that they're coming up to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3787.79s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's right in front of the church over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3800.121s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They have special paint for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3801.262s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=600.092s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=604.313s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Can we incorporate the comments of the prior two speakers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=608.785s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and have on the suspension, bring in the paper for the purposes of tonight of making the request for sending the tax rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=629.621s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1075.966s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Point before we get into that, uh, Mr. O'Neill point of information for the assessor before you start suddenly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1087.257s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You were asked last week to forward us information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1090.078s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You indicated there was 1,569 parcels of land that are over the $580,000 assessed value.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1098.7s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And we asked for a breakdown of that 580 going up in increments of $50,000 per piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1105.642s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We never got that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1387.035s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So... Just a point of clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1389.337s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1390.618s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As you're making this assumption that the values, as they go up significantly, even if you took a house that's valued at $800,000, they're going to get an increase of $202.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1400.345s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1402.781s">[Robert Penta]</a>: over and beyond whatever the tax rate's gonna be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1405.243s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if you go to a house that's only valued at $400,000, they're gonna get a decrease of 161.91.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1418.814s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I wouldn't want anyone to think that the same type of value going up doesn't correspond to the devaluation going down, because there is merit that goes both ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1427.981s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's quite obvious that under the 580, going backwards,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1431.209s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and lower amount, the rate is even higher giving back than going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1436.452s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you're only talking about 1,569 votes, you know, to me, I think this is an important time to really take into consideration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1444.255s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maybe it's about time we start looking at this and giving rate payers in this community a break because, you know, they're just going to get saddled now with the CPA tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1453.3s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, whether you voted for it or not, every house is going to get stuck with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1456.661s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1457.062s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Fiscal 17 for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1458.062s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Pardon me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1458.883s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Fiscal 17.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1460.285s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But they're still going to get stuck with it for five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1463.387s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And for the next five years, they're going to be stuck with a tax that, whether you voted for it or against it, you're going to be stuck with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1470.511s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I think if there's a way to look at a break here for the homeowners, it's giving that exemption, whether it's 10, 15, or 20%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1476.995s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I'm leaning toward that, because I think if you can afford a house that's $800,000,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1484.224s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can afford to pay maybe another couple hundred dollars more a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1489.209s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know how many houses in the city are worth $800,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1492.954s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you've got 1,569 houses broken down from 580 going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1498.42s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've got 9,000 and something from 580 going backwards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=1503.005s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it sort of tells me that the majority should rule in something like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2397.918s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, Mr. O'Neill, on this handout that you gave us, you used a tax rate of $11.19, but then you went over to, with the residential exemption, you increased the tax rate to $12.10.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2408.405s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, why'd you do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2486.215s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why can't the council do, let's just say we talked for hypothetical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2491.018s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We take the 10% exemption and at the, at the same time, can we go after non owner occupied residences and charge them at a higher rate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2527.144s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I'm talking about an out-of-towner that owns multiple pieces of property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2533.248s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So where do they fit into this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2534.469s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can't call them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2537.251s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you adopt hypothetically, how come other cities and towns can charge a higher rate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2592.367s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2592.688s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So for example, the, the average right now, if we tack the 1119, the average house is going to go up approximately $130.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2601.891s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is that what you're saying?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2622.21s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And how much would it be if it was the $12.10?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2624.211s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It wouldn't be $130.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2627.052s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How much would it be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2636.535s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, no, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2638.036s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The average house you said is 340.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2643.934s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So what's 424 at 1119 and 424 at 1210?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2662.54s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Do the 10%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2672.051s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So then these numbers are incorrect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2723.581s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Do we have anything on the books right now that designates a condominium in the city of Medford from a two family house being converted over?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2738.154s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It talks about a two or three family house into a condominium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2742.718s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Uh, like a moratorium to, no, we have any kind of law that addresses this in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2751.104s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you would know nothing unless you get something from the registry of deeds?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2756.086s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you would get nothing from the registry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2758.366s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Unless you got it from the registry of deeds, people could be living in two houses, condo in and out, and the city would not know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2771.231s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So where are they going to record it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2797.188s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the city has nothing on the books right now that addresses legally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2802.833s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're going back for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2803.994s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This has been going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2804.795s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We still have nothing officially on the books that talks about two, three and four family houses being converted to condominiums, other than if they're bought and sold and you get the information from the register.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2856.176s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So for example, if I owned a house, two family house, and I wanted to sell the second floor, first time selling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2864.4s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I work out a deal with the tenant, I mean the person upstairs, so it won't be recorded as a condo and be assessed at a higher rate than if it was a regular two family house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=2878.524s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the city's only assessing that piece of property as a rental piece of property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4136.593s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. O'Neill, question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4142.514s">[Robert Penta]</a>: With the change in the tax rate to $11.19 from last year to this year,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4146.255s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What's the net dollar amount increase that the city will be gaining with this new tax rate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4217.912s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You just said you can read the whole thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4219.213s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4219.813s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I am on page 2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4223.696s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And on page 2, I don't have what you have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4228.479s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is this 2?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4231.481s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Ed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4232.122s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What does it look like?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4232.942s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Are you sure it's 2?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4242.984s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What was he talking about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4247.065s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4253.568s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yeah, he doesn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4259.13s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4268.611s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can barely see him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4297.402s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But what's the actual difference in from last year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4300.503s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Are we raising $2 million, $3 million, $4 million?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4302.444s">[Robert Penta]</a>: $4,350,000 in the levy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4337.863s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you're saying from last year to this year, with the tax rate that you have set, it's going to be $4,350,000?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4342.386s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4342.586s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4343.086s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And will Councilor Lungo-Koehn has<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4346.731s">[Robert Penta]</a>: alluding to that if we knock off a million dollars of that, that brings it down to $3,350,000, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4354.294s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4354.895s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And on an annual basis, it's historical for the last 6.7 years that we've had nothing less than a million dollars left over in free cash each and every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4364.699s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're close to $7 million in free cash, Ann?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4368.16s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How much do we have in free cash right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4373.609s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Oh 9.6 9.6 million in free cash, mr. Councilor so Why should we want to keep?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4382.734s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Beating up the method taxpayer if they knew that they have such large reason we're making the city rich Without doing anything about it and the taxpayers are paying for it Now when we talk about having a 10% exemption to get whatever the exemption might be 10 15 or 20 percent the fact of the matter is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4401.634s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you're saying that $580,100 is the cutoff point and bringing it forward up to $1.2 million, it's an increase of $566.09.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4410.522s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know how many people in this city own a house for $1.2 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4415.006s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4416.447s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I know a lot of people own maybe between $580,000 to $700,000, and that may be nothing more from $1.98 to $111 more per year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4421.612s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if we follow the mindset that why do we keep<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4429.225s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If we can reduce that limit by even another million dollars and knowing you're going to be getting the million dollars in in June, as we have historically for the last seven years, it makes sense at least to give the taxpayers some kind of a break, even if you were to try this thing out for a year to see where we're going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4446.312s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It makes no, you've had 29 years in a row of tax rate increases here in the city and you have the same problems now, if not larger now than you've had before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4455.215s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have a police department that's understaffed by 10 people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4457.815s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have an office of community development that's one and a half people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4460.996s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have a city hall building that's in deplorable, disgusting shape when you walk out into the corridors and you go into the men's room and the ladies' room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4468.139s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have a ceiling ready to come down on top of you that's running almost three years growing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4473.321s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And we talk about the wonderful financial thing that Moody says we have a great bond rating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4477.803s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And to paraphrase Mr. Capucci and Mr. Viglione, the fact of the matter is, what are we having all this money for if we're not spending the taxpayers' money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4486.897s">[Robert Penta]</a>: just so the city can look good, and a Moody's bond rating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4491.919s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'd rather spend the money and have the city look better, knowing that the taxpayers' money is being used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4497.661s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if we can work out, if we can start to figure out now, whether it's this year or next year, that you develop a tax exemption, a residential exemption, that can work, then we should be doing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4508.265s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We shouldn't be just saying, well, we're going to take what we've done in the past, go to 1.175%, and give it the lowest residential factor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4515.186s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If we were going to give it the lowest residential factor possible, then there should be no tax rate increase at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4521.612s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We've got all this money sitting in the bank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4524.555s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why would you want to go out there and bang the taxpayer anywhere from $135 up for whatever?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4532.022s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The problem, as I see it, Mr. O'Neill and Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4535.085s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Baker and Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4536.166s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Miller, is there's been absolutely no discussion with this council<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4540.557s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This legislative body, as it relates to prior to you folks setting a tax, having any discussion on how to change some of these things, having any discussion on when I'm going to Beacon Hill, bringing our state reps and senators in to say, what can we do to play with this thing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4556.931s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We haven't had at least strike.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4558.452s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'll speak for myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4559.693s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I have never been asked once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4560.854s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I have called, but I have never been asked once to be part of a circle of discussion on any of these tax rate increases or proposals or whatever they might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4569.642s">[Robert Penta]</a>: even to get into the merit of tax rate exemptions, even to get into the non-owner-occupier who comes into this community, and we have to give them the service of fire, police, public works, and sometimes even schooling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4583.21s">[Robert Penta]</a>: For what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4583.951s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the Medford taxpayer winds up paying for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4586.212s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The guy who legitimately pays his taxes each and every year winds up paying for all of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4591.896s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And for 29 years in a row, the tax rate in this community has increased under the President's administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4598.179s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what do we still have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4599.372s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We still have a deplorable infrastructure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4602.215s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have water and sewer concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4604.277s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have a public building here that needs, that's historically, you know, it needs a lot of help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4610.144s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have a police department and a fire department that needs all kinds of work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4614.303s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then what do we have, as Councilor Longo just alluded to, you have a school department still creating more jobs as they did last night, $85,000 for a brand new position to have a public relations person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4625.43s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what the superintendent gets $160,000 for, to do the public relations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4630.073s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then you can't find enough teachers to teach a class because we don't have enough money in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4634.116s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then we're starting to think about maybe security in the buildings because it's now becoming an ongoing problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4639.309s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But when teachers don't have enough pencils, and teachers don't have enough books, and they don't have enough classroom help, and PTOs are always asking for support from the administration, and this is the fifth, sixth job that they've created in the last year that's in excess of $85,000 to $90,000 a year, and we still cannot have that resolved to the point that it's political patronage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4660.807s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's all that it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4662.328s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not educational patronage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4664.089s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's political patronage, and it's wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4666.892s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And hopefully this new administration comes in and recognizes this, because it's wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4671.294s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It serves no purpose for the value and the quality of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4675.515s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Those jobs don't add anything to Moody's bond rating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4678.816s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know what they add to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4679.957s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They add to people saying you can't beat City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4682.518s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're all in bed with each other, and every politician is crooked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4685.999s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what they say, because you can't beat City Hall with nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4690.06s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're trying to, slowly but surely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4692.261s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I thought it was going to take place, but it didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4694.524s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But when we have a tax rate that's ready to go and set to go, and we know we're sitting on almost $9 million in free cash, $7.5 million in your water and sewer account, and there's still no plan in front of you, and you're still not part of the program, then there's something wrong around here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4710.247s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Something's terribly wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4711.427s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I hope the taxpayers wake up and finally realize that they've got to come to this real, and they have to talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=4982.121s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Councilor, you're all set?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5261.843s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Um, Ed, I don't think he answered the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5265.964s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The question is simply this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5267.504s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If we would have just leave the rate the same as it was last year with no increase, what would it be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5359.541s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the question could be answered, that if you were going to, since the assessed values have gone up from last year to this year, and to keep everything to be the, I mean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5374.47s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It can't stay the same, the values have gone up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5376.752s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if the values have gone up and you kept it at last year's rate, wouldn't that still cover you for the budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5386.396s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's nothing in the law that says you have to go to the max.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5389.057s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5394.098s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So all the council Longo was trying to propose was if you took, if you knocked off a million dollars, which is a million off of the $4 million and you're going to be getting that money back in June anyway, when free cash is certified, you'd have a better understanding of how this budget, you know, works better for the taxpayer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5413.443s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'll defer it to Louise Miller.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5451.196s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the council, I think we agree with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5454.698s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have $9.6 million in free cash, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5457.4s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That is correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5457.84s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have $9.6 million in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5459.802s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you folks were, if the council were agreeable to knock the million dollars off, if in fact the worst thing that could happen, if you couldn't meet your debt obligation, when June, the end of May, June comes, you still have free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5472.833s">[Robert Penta]</a>: to balance out whatever needs to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5475.113s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So all Councilor Lungo-Koehn was trying to do, if I understand it correctly, was to knock off a million dollars right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5480.514s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if it works, all things being equal, there would be the tax rate increase, would be by 40% less, instead of 130 on the house for 424, it would be $70 or $60.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5491.516s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It isn't like you're wiping it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5494.317s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're just keeping all things being equal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5496.917s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, a few years back, it was Councilor Marks to his credit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5500.038s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The only one that didn't vote<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5501.74s">[Robert Penta]</a>: to take the money out of the Water and Sewer account because the mayor underfunded the budget by a million one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5506.764s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And they took the money out of the Water and Sewer account and you had to go to the legislature for a special act of the legislature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5512.327s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And no one else ever did it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5514.209s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No other city in town in there would ever do it again, because that was the wrong thing to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5518.692s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But we're sitting on nine and a half million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5521.614s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why is the city so reluctant to try out something and see where it takes us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5529.059s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, no, no, we're talking about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5531.649s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I know you're talking about it, but at the same time, I think it needs to be explained better to the point that, you know, we're not cash-strapped poor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5539.795s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're sitting on $9.5 million, and even if we get another six or seven or rate of $900,000 this year, that will offset whatever the million dollars you're taking off the increase in the override by a million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5551.544s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, what is so hard to understand this for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5553.885s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5571.931s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You'd be taking out of free cash, though, Louise, not the reserves of the water and sewer account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5578.253s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5578.433s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5580.194s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if you have $9.5 million and it keeps increasing each and every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5582.795s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Point of information, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5591.637s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, we're talking about the question that he didn't answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5594.217s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What would it be to keep the tax rate the same as it was last year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=5597.438s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It'd be 2.4 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6093.076s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Question, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6097.544s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On the line there where it says a substantial, who wrote this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6101.066s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is this state wording?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6103.847s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. O'Neill, who wrote number three, adopt a residential exemption?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6114.733s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And your letter to the council dated November 23rd, when you have the four things, it says adopt a residential exemption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6120.956s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Who wrote the wording for these four things?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6125.86s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's dated November 25th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6127.241s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Probably I did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6140.429s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, I would make a suggestion that the word substantial is eliminated because it is not a substantial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6145.893s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The $1,569 doesn't compare anywhere to $9,000, close to $10,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6147.714s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it gives the impression that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6152.311s">[Robert Penta]</a>: a substantial number of people are going to be paying higher, because... Duly noted, Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6156.853s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Pardon me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6158.454s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6159.094s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because according to what you gave us over this past weekend and tonight, you know, it's quite obvious that, you know, it's not substantial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6168.339s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a progression from 580 or whatever that number in the future is going to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6172.02s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6172.12s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6172.42s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Will do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6494.854s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On the small commercial exemption, you indicate here in the wording that you shift the portion from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6502.573s">[Robert Penta]</a>: one group to another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6504.755s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And since this shift causes a higher commercial and industrial tax rate, all commercial and industrial not receiving the exemption would see an increase in their tax bills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6516.244s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When you use the purpose of somebody having 10 or more people and the value is less than a million dollars, they can receive the exemption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6526.812s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is that state statute that says that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6528.654s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's correct, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6531.121s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So how many of these properties exist in the city of Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6552.387s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, no, no, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6553.327s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6554.147s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yep, yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6554.747s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How many people does this affect?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6602.533s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you're saying that there's 450 small businesses that would be eligible for this, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6617.078s">[Robert Penta]</a>: 72 owner occupies, that would be 10 or less people, 450 that have the small business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6622.66s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So how many of the ones over that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6816.764s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Quick question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6817.564s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When you came before us for the budget, how come this wasn't introduced?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6821.085s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You knew what the dollar amount was going to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6827.426s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So is this bid going to cover us until when?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6840.728s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So does this dollar amount start from January,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=6844.105s">[Robert Penta]</a>: of this year and then goes to June and then start to jump the end of July.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7211.267s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Ed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7212.849s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You just said that the money's used, it's put in the overlay surplus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7218.545s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is this accumulated each and every year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7220.527s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is it carryover money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7245.164s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7246.165s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7247.316s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Historically, what does the city usually pay out in this account during the course of a year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7285.143s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So what's the dollar amount, so the people can hear it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7293.148s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It goes into the recap and then it goes into the surplus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7321.577s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, I don't understand if Louise, you just got through saying that this, when council Max asked the question that this has nothing to do with our bond rating, but now all of a sudden,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7331.246s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This can be taken out, I think, if you said by the executive of the community, in use for other city expenses, which is a direct reflection upon the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7355.286s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Or the mayor can make a request to take it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7358.608s">[Robert Penta]</a>: OK, so when you take a vote on, you say yes to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7360.929s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It now goes into a budgetary item, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7364.651s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if it's appropriated for a budgetary item, then why wouldn't that, in and of itself, the surplus in and of itself, be considered part of a bond rating?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7371.974s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because what if you had no money in there at all?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7373.775s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What would you do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7381.318s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What would you do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7402.289s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But how do you accumulate a $490,000 balance right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7404.269s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So it's probably—it would be $720,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7405.45s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As of right now, tonight, before this vote, there's $720,000 in that account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7407.711s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How much do you— No, no, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7425.748s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You just said there's $490,000 left.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7433.133s">[Robert Penta]</a>: After this $250,000 goes out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7455.529s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It doesn't go into an overlay surplus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7459.511s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So why would that be part of this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7461.132s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're waiting to collect on real estate taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7485.734s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Louise, you mentioned in the community, the whole that, you know, you're going to be having some new financial restructuring and consideration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7492.015s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have two new councils coming on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7494.296s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it would be beneficial to have the entire council sit down and understand some of this because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7500.1s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This can be confusing, and at the same time, it becomes contradictory, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7503.701s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can't have a real estate account that's going to put money in there, which is part of the general fund, and then once the money goes into the overlay surplus, it's not to be considered part of, you know, Standard Moody's, you know, standard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7514.385s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I understand this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7518.066s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's moving money around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7519.266s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's the old shell game, huh?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7766.71s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7767.61s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Um, most recently, uh, last week we had a situation here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7771.011s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7771.886s">[Robert Penta]</a>: where a commentary was made by one of my colleagues, who's not here tonight, as it relates to he wanted to congratulate somebody for his recent appointment within a union position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7783.37s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's all well and good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7785.151s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I tried to give my opinion as to why I didn't think it was a good idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7790.213s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And my commentary was somewhat repressed by you sitting in the chair, Mr. President, because, you know, it's my right to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7797.347s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have every one of these Councilors over here, men and women, give resolutions on any one given Tuesday night as it relates to who they want to congratulate and what have you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7806.475s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if somebody has a different point of view, that likewise should be entertained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7810.819s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I wasn't speaking on behalf of anyone but myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7814.302s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And while somebody is being praised for their promotion, I just did not feel it was correct because that same one person who you were praising for his promotion was the same person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7823.25s">[Robert Penta]</a>: who went into a municipal building and lied and told mistruths about me during this past campaign.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7828.971s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I didn't think that was true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7830.191s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7831.031s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think the people ought to know this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7832.812s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you're going to take advantage of sitting here and trying to acknowledge someone, you need to take the opposite side if somebody has a different point of view.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7840.553s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There are people that come before this podium that try to express themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7843.894s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And sometimes they get shut off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7845.174s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Sometimes they're ignored.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7846.654s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And sometimes they're being told enough is enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7849.274s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, this is the only forum in the entire community of Medford<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7852.798s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that people have an opportunity to come and speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7855.26s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have a newspaper that's a week late, and that doesn't serve any purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7860.224s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You also have a school committee that meets biweekly, and sometimes that doesn't serve any purpose, because by the time you get the news after the fact, whatever takes place has already been done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7870.911s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But whether you agree or disagree with the purpose of that podium, it's there to allow the people to come and speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7877.536s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And my commentary last week was, I did not vote for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7882.738s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Nor would I approve of commending anybody who gets a promotion in their union job, who took advantage of his position, to come and bash another elected official.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7893.626s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I just think it was wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7895.647s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm a big boy, and I can stand here, and I can take any abuse that anyone wants to give.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7899.831s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But when they lie and distort the truth and misrepresent, and they get promoted on those principles, that's not the principles of hard and good work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7908.397s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's just the principles of somebody<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7910.308s">[Robert Penta]</a>: who is just a bad person, as far as I'm concerned, as it relates to them doing a job that they did not do well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7919.954s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, my character was addressed by that gentleman that you voted for, that you wanted to commend, Councilor Dello Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7926.318s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if you don't like it, then you shouldn't have voted for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7928.519s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And we're free to not vote for the resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7929.6s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And probably it shouldn't have been here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7931.161s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Are we going to commend and congratulate every single person in this community that gets a promotion in their job or graduates from a college?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7939.457s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Are we going to do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7940.177s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We might as well start doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7941.838s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's a lot of people who are left out, who live in side streets, main streets, up in the hillside, West Method, South Method, in your own neighborhood, who are wonderful people and they've done great things here in this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7952.524s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Never see them getting commended and congratulated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7955.385s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But when you go out of your way to pick a particular person, to congratulate that person who intentionally went out of their way to attack a councilor by<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7964.574s">[Robert Penta]</a>: saying untruths, mistruths, and lies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7967.556s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I am never going to sit here and let that get by on anyone, whether I agreed with you or disagreed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7972.458s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would be defending your position, Councilor De La Russa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7975.219s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I wouldn't let anybody do that to you, especially if I knew it was untruth and it was a lie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7979.982s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Having a difference of opinion is one thing, but telling a lie I will not stand for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7985.985s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Listen, I've served 39 years as an elected official in this community, and there isn't one person that will be able to come to that rail and say I lied about them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7993.542s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I lied about what I was doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7995.343s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't believe in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7996.143s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't have to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=7997.684s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I don't need to have that done to me as it was in this past campaign.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8001.606s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I don't need to have people think that that's what took place, when, in fact, it did take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8007.149s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you can sit there all you want, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8009.11s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I would hope next year, whoever sits in that chair — I think it's your turn, Rick, to sit in the chair — I would hope whoever sits in that chair, if it's you, you allow people to come and speak, and you'll let them know what the truth is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8019.925s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because that's the only forum in the city of Medford that allows somebody here to come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8024.648s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Try to go to City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8025.888s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Try to go meet with the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8027.289s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Get to the four secretaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8028.91s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Good luck to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8029.61s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And try to get your opinion expressed around here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8031.992s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8032.752s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's the podium where it all begins and where it ends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8034.913s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And hopefully that stays that way because that's the people's forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8038.325s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's what we're getting paid to do, to represent the people, not to represent ourselves and to give out jobs and take care of each other with political appointments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8046.173s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, that's not what we're here for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8047.555s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's not what I'm here for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8049.117s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I will never ever allow anyone in this community to stand there and lie about me in public or in private, knowing when it's false, it's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8057.085s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I would stand here and defend any one of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8059.686s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And those sitting on that community, out in that audience, because that's not the way government should be run.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8064.307s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you want to win an election, do it the right way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8066.527s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Do it the honest way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8068.188s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Don't go in there and lie about someone to try to generate votes, because that's what took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8073.609s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can say all you want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8075.269s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can say all you want about the resolution that Mr. Knight and the gentleman that he wanted to congratulate last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8081.47s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I don't buy it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8082.251s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't accept it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8083.391s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think it was a terrible, terrible act that that gentleman committed here in the city of Medford, trying to con<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8089.985s">[Robert Penta]</a>: union members into this community, making them believe bad things about me during this past campaign, and I will not stand for it, and I do not accept it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8737.784s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, the matter was simply this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8739.685s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There are not too many of these folks that work in the school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8744.227s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't think they've seen a raise in eight to nine years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8746.728s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Um, our superintendent,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8748.86s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If the budget turned around, he said he would investigate it, look into it, and if they needed to get one, strike that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8754.704s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If that be the case, that he would take care of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8757.045s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, nothing's been taken care of as we speak here tonight, other than a new $90,000 job being given out to the school committee last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8765.47s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8782.596s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, that's not true either, because if that be the case, there's been no communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8786.739s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This thing will strike that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8787.98s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I've got the floor, Paul, all right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8789.582s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The superintendent was going to the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8794.667s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Pardon me, sir?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8795.107s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Say that again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8795.768s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Say it again louder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8796.488s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I didn't hear you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8800.867s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you spoke up, maybe we could understand what's going on around here and you wouldn't be so rude.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8804.968s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8805.908s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The fact of the matter is simply this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8807.348s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These workers have been waiting for almost eight and a half years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8810.549s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Can you please tell him to keep quiet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8814.57s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We'll restrain ourselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8816.81s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This has been going on for eight and a half years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8818.371s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It took place at the last budgetary hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8820.751s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Superintendent Sunday was going to get back to us whether this took place last night or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8824.512s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8825.351s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Still waiting for an answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8826.832s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If it did, well, we could to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8828.232s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Can we, did they vote this last night?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8830.973s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They gave a 10% raise?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8834.835s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Pardon me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8838.077s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Can't ask them a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8838.937s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're going to be your future colleagues in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8841.478s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Um, two of the colleagues who are going to be on this board next year just indicated that they got a pay raise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8846.38s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So with that being said, I accept their acknowledgement to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8850.042s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Um, they seem to be more creditable than anyone else around here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8853.377s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I thank you for that information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8921.736s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's not what the resolution says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8923.056s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The resolution says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8924.037s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, no, I'm talking about your dissertation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8927.979s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, are we going to be able to speak without being interrupted?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8932.18s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Are you going to rule them out of order?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8934.261s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8937.523s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Read it, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8950.13s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's what we talked about being reviewed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8951.751s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as I realized until coming in here tonight and just a couple of minutes ago, nothing came across my desk telling me that they have been gotten their raise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8960.618s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I just asked our two new colleagues coming on in January that they got their raise last night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8965.341s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I thank them for the information again for the second time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8969.046s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=8969.766s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10006.21s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, Henry and his wife Evelyn have done a tremendous amount of work in this particular area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10011.595s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and it's nice to see them get recognized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10013.576s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These are the type of resolutions that belong before the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10016.537s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These are the type of acknowledgements of letting our people in the community know that folks such as this are doing this as works of humanity and for community awareness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10027.763s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The ARC community recognizes folks such as Henry, the national, Henry and his wife, because it's just not in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10036.827s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They go to other communities and they work with the intellectual<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10040.73s">[Robert Penta]</a>: physical disabilities of people that just unfortunately just don't have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10045.133s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Um, they're very quiet unassuming folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10047.175s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They don't go out there and beat their chest and say, look at me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10049.917s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're just wonderful people who live here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10053.34s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I just think it's great to give them the acknowledgement that they deserve and for the work that they do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10283.333s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Al was the unassuming type of a fellow that, be it politics or sports, he was the guy, he was like the go-to guy to go to here in the city of Medford because in his early days when he worked at the Method Mercury, which happened to be the old Mystic Bakery location, he was an interesting fellow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10301.102s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You could walk into there and you'd talk about sports and you'd talk about your local politics and you would,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10306.377s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you get a pretty good answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10307.959s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And he was a pretty honest reporter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10309.781s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And he was pretty fair in how he reported.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10312.644s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the best part that I think about Al, he would always talk to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10316.429s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He always, in his opinion, really meant something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10319.332s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And he was appreciative of the fact that you would take the time and either shake his hand or go to talk to him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10326.265s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, he's the type of a staple here in the city of Medford that you don't see very often, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10331.949s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And unfortunately, he's no longer with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10334.43s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I would hope that his family and friends that did love him and did respect him understand that, you know, it's a part of your life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10340.174s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a part of our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10341.755s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as Council President Dello Russo alluded to, when he was writing for the Medford Mercury, he was a pretty fair guy, very hard to find in today's journalism.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uGSqTk1i0kA&t=10349.821s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And so with that being said, I think we'll take a moment of silence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=487.143s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Two points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=487.604s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I appreciate the fact that you're here, sir.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=490.457s">[Robert Penta]</a>: First of all, I have no idea about this communication that was sent, so I'm assuming one of the reasons why you're here, because the council has asked you folks to be here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=497.979s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We would like to believe that there's been weekly meetings with people in this building, and you folks, and Zappa Construction on the bridge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=506.24s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We've been asking for updates, and this was all foreign to us as of a week ago, so the question is, is that true or false?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=513.302s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Have you been meeting with people?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=535.356s">[Robert Penta]</a>: At our field office, at your field office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=537.036s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's, and that's what we had asked for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=538.536s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, we'd asked for updates as it relates to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=540.817s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And we never got a response back from anybody as it relates to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=544.638s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=558.383s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That may be them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=559.023s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is the council wanting to find out because when we get questions asked to us by the taxpayers and the residents and folks that are using the bus stops, we don't have answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=566.985s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's the reason why the sense of frustration has taken place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=569.885s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you're meeting with them and we're asking for reports and minutes to the meetings, we get nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=574.206s">[Robert Penta]</a>: because nothing's come back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=576.527s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I just want to know you have met with these people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=578.949s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That is correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=579.589s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=579.829s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's all you need to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=580.75s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=581.751s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Number two, as it relates to the issue regarding the bus stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=584.632s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=585.493s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Um, again, from further information that's been given to us, and I think the city clerk can attest to the fact the gentleman from the MBTA has indicated he will not come out to a night meeting to discuss bus stops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=596.059s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, where are we going with this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=598.281s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If this is supposed to be working together,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=600.962s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This can't work like that if they're not going to come out at nighttime to meet with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=610.806s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=611.206s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, maybe in your bailiwick of inventory of folks, you can figure out how to get them here because the bus stop comes under the control of the council, as you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=632.095s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And one other thing, if you can do this, um, you indicate that there are certain folks that are going to be affected and they are, if you walk around those businesses in the square, nobody has contacted them telling them of other bridge that took place a few weeks ago when you started doing some work there, the change in the time, the work, the work schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=651.259s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's gotta be more communication because you know, business the way it is, it's tough to begin with and trying to keep your doors open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=658.0s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You meet all your expenses, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=660.201s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is a huge project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=661.121s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We know that it's going to take place until 2017, but if there's no actual personal contact and conversation with the business owners, you're going to have a hard time, you know, selling the project because you're having a hard time selling it to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=675.264s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But now you're telling me, and I'm glad they appreciate that people in the city are, you know, we have not gotten that response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=680.344s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We don't even know what this lady you're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=682.365s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So Mr. Clerk, if we can ask, can you copy the letter?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=685.865s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We don't know about this letter about the bus stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=687.906s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Just hearing about it for the first time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=691.588s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Do you have a copy that you could give us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=698.03s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You sent it November 18th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=701.891s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, and who'd you address, Mr. Daly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=704.752s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Who'd you address that to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=708.153s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Could you make a copy of the letter?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=711.593s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's not the letter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=712.414s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's the letter?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=715.735s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Do you have a copy of the letter, Mr. Daly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=722.591s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Please, for all the councillors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=754.072s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Are you all through?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=755.493s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm just concerned over the fact that is there a time requirement to this letter?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=778.674s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So this is their request that went out per letter, November 14th, they're looking for two week headstart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=784.278s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're hearing about this for the very first time and where the decision makers of where that bus stop goes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=792.444s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think you can understand where I'm coming from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=794.186s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's kind of like obvious that, you know, there's been no communication, you know, and they may just have to wait.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1045.907s">[Robert Penta]</a>: One more group you might want to inform.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1047.949s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Point of information, Council Member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1049.01s">[Robert Penta]</a>: One more group might be the Medford Chamber of Commerce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1850.189s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, I think Mr... Who's the gentleman from the state?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1853.19s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Who's that fellow?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1855.23s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Scott.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1855.47s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Scott, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1894.771s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But taking that into consideration, you said you listen to any and all ideas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1897.894s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If in fact that doesn't work, you could still have those buses go right into Medford square cause we had discussed as a spot of the issue and with the square is, and they could just traverse themselves around river street and come back, which is a one way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1909.985s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you could just reverse the one way, go on the opposite way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1912.687s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that would make it easier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1913.528s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Cause don't forget you have two senior citizen buildings over there in excess of 500 people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1917.592s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And for them to walk any further,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1919.521s">[Robert Penta]</a>: in the end of that ring road, then to cross over and go underneath the bridge, where it'd be a lot easier just to go to Mitford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1925.524s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So, and again, folks that might have a handicap or a disability coming from Salem Street, Forest Street, or High Street would still be taking the same amount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1933.308s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If not, it would be shorter for them just to walk across the square through the crosswalks, because you said you'd be making them properly and slated to be traversed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1942.192s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you have options that are there, and that's all that the council wanted to discuss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1946.552s">[Robert Penta]</a>: is what the options are, what would work the best, and it becomes very hard when you have no communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1951.294s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I'm just throwing that out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1953.354s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Understood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1954.355s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1955.475s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Chair recognizes Vice President Lungo-Koehn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=1989.183s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, but what's the contact?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2042.646s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And one of the other things to the chair, um, you said this was going to be a six day a week double shift project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2105.81s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's your schedule now, but I believe when you folks were here, the presentation was made, it was going to be a double shift twice a week, six days a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2137.57s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, wouldn't it make more sense if you did double shifts twice a day?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2140.451s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We wouldn't have to wait to 2017?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2141.611s">[Robert Penta]</a>: 18, excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2217.903s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't think it advances the cause to wait to 2018 even for 121 feet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2884.508s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Quick question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2886.068s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're saying that the 500,000 is an estimate,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2888.848s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Do we have a final number?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2899.432s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So is it possible that they may not accept the $500,000?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2931.636s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But why haven't we heard yet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2932.876s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why is it taking so long?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=2948.41s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3046.31s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Could you explain what this money is for please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3099.591s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3101.112s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So this is kind of like interesting because a couple of years ago when they were discussing the budget, when the council had asked that the money be taken from the water and sewer account, um, the water and sewer commission indicated that that wasn't their purview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3113.738s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was up to the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3115.639s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now you're saying tonight that they made a recommendation to take this money<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3119.428s">[Robert Penta]</a>: of approximately $700,000 or above to go to offset the cost of our water and soil bills here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3129.792s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Don't forget, I believe we get a discount, strike that, we get a wholesale discount rate from the MWRA, and then the rest of the cost relates to the city of Medford's operation, water and soil department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3139.236s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3139.396s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3140.497s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if we take this balance, if we transfer this money, we have a balance of $7,036,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3144.738s">[Robert Penta]</a>: $7 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3150.401s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I just don't understand why they just don't take the whole thing from the water and sewer account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3154.923s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's the taxpayer's money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3156.244s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They'd be the overpaid or whatever the account might situation might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3160.305s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That would have made it a $7.7 million surplus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3163.206s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the amount that you're taking out right now leaves you with a balance of $7,036,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3166.568s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's the taxpayer's money, the rate payers money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3170.449s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They didn't cost, they didn't, it wasn't their charge to raise the rates, you know, and if they made a mistake somewhere along the line, as it relates to this rate structure,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3179.618s">[Robert Penta]</a>: then that needs to be figured out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3180.818s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the taxpayers should not have to pay for it, especially since this is their money that they've had there in surplus for all this amount of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3188.6s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The law is very simple, as you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3190.14s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's either one or two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3191.54s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The law says, unless you have something that's ready to go in a ready-made project within 90 days, or there's a surplus remaining that goes back to the rate payers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3200.582s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, this has been going on for a few years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3202.122s">[Robert Penta]</a>: $7 million and $36 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3203.302s">[Robert Penta]</a>: $7 million, $36,000, leaving you with a balance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3205.182s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm going to vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3209.51s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that this not go through, that this money come out of the Water and Soil Enterprise account, period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3216.712s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The rate payers should not have to pay for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3218.493s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let the city figure out where they went wrong and if they have to make an adjustment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3222.154s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because it's bad enough that they've been taxed for everything in this community from A to Z. And I just don't think it's fair, especially knowing that you have a remaining balance of $7 million and there is not one project sitting in front of us right now that has a demand of any kind of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3238.208s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that the water and sewer account has for a balance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3240.009s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3240.629s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Number two, I can see leaving maybe two or $3 million in that account in case an emergency takes place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3245.891s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We've had no discussion from the city engineer, the building department or the highway department, public works department regarding a project that the city needs to undertake right now or it's going to be undertaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3258.316s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All we know right now is that there is this kind of a surplus sitting there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3262.498s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's unfair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3263.999s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't think that the rate payers should have their money that they've paid for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3268.335s">[Robert Penta]</a>: now be charged again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3269.456s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think that money should stay in this account and the city and the city engineer and the new administration should figure out what all the INI and the water leaks and the things that need to be corrected here in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3280.264s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They better get on their duff real quick because this is what the administration has been talking about, whether it was myself or the incoming person, you know, this city needs to have a lot of reconstruction in this community as it relates to their water and sewer, their INI and their street and their side construction projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3297.157s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3297.902s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Take this out of this account and transfer it over to pay a debt that belongs with the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3303.644s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If they mismanaged and miscalculated, don't blame the taxpayer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3307.425s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They've been blamed enough for what goes on in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=3310.806s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm going to move, Mr. President, that the money come out of the retained earnings of the Water and Sewer account and not be transferred.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4329.82s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, I agree with Councilor Marks and my colleague Councilor Lungo-Koehn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4333.701s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The interesting part, you were at that meeting,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4336.487s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Louise, as it relates to the conservation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4338.949s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What did the commissioner say?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4339.89s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That the sad part about this whole thing, the people are conserving more, but they're going to have to be paying more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4344.975s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the ball bounces itself back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4347.036s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This goes back to almost like the green barrel before you got here, the green barrel issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4351.18s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When we got into these green barrels and we get into this whole idea of being conservation and recycling, and we have the two different size barrels here, but what happens here to the city of Medford because of the recycling, which cuts down on the hardcore,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4363.795s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The waste that cost the city, I think it was last year, $159,000 more, because even though we were recycling more, we went from three to 30%, it still cost the city more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4375.041s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And people just need to understand something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4378.183s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, if you're going to use less, why are you paying more?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4383.886s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So some people may get the attitude, if I'm going to pay for them, I should just use it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4387.588s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the whole conservation theme, it's going to be lost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4391.31s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The other part of the issue is that, again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4394.082s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's $7.7 million of tax payers, rate payers money that's been sitting there with no major projects on ready to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4403.708s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Nowhere, nowhere to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4405.249s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the law is very succinct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4406.75s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's either 90 days ready to go or it goes back to the rate payers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4410.473s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now we know that there's a projected rate increase coming in this year from the MWRA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4415.036s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Who's going to eat that again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4416.236s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's going to be the rate payers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4417.918s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So it's bad enough that they're going to have to pay for the increase to the water and sewer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4422.171s">[Robert Penta]</a>: system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4422.531s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I understand you have to pay for salaries and all the contract negotiations that take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4427.253s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But when you're sitting on the surplus like this, there was no reason why the rate payer, the rate payers should get involved in paying off whatever the difference might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4434.556s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Councilor Marks just alluded to something a few years ago and kudos to him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4438.318s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He was the only council that voted against taking a million point one ballot, a million point $100,000 out of the water and sewer account to offset the mayor's budget deficit to balance his proposed budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4450.723s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And he was right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4451.673s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It should have never been done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4453.033s">[Robert Penta]</a>: First and only time in the legislature, first and last time it's going to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4457.654s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is the rate payers' money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4459.335s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, it's bad enough you've got them with the Republic kiosk parking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4462.815s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, you're hitting them in every single corner here with attacks and attacks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4468.196s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And their streets, their roads, their bridges and everything is just in a state of chaos.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4473.517s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I just cannot in good conscience go forward with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4476.198s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm not going to support it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4478.358s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It doesn't belong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4479.219s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It doesn't belong here right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4481.16s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And until the city can get its act together financially as to where it needs to go, how it needs to resolve this water and soil situation, so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4488.684s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There are so many options here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4491.065s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have a consultant that tells you you're in a deficit, you gotta start saving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4494.787s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then when you start saving, you gotta save more than what you're saving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4498.649s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't care about other cities and towns, and I don't care about our bond rating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4503.271s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What I care about is having taxpayers spend too much money on more than being charged for more than what's necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4510.92s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Life is not too easy right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4512.901s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You may hear all kinds of great stories out there about the economy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4515.963s">[Robert Penta]</a>: People are still struggling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4517.123s">[Robert Penta]</a>: People are still out there that haven't received raises in five and six years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4521.166s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The employees in this building and citywide and the school department, they should be thankful they have their jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4527.729s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thankful they have their jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4529.87s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And they shouldn't be complaining about, you know, we're not getting enough of a percentage here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4533.732s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're everywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4534.693s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You want to negotiate in good faith?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4535.993s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I've got no problem in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4537.594s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But don't go out and hit the people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4539.173s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that don't have that job security, that haven't gotten that pay raise in two or three years, and knowingly should not have to pay for this deficit that, unfortunately, was created by a miscalculation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4550.701s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I won't say it was intentional, but an unintentional miscalculation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4553.883s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you're going to have to go back to the drawing boards and revisit it, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4558.206s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's the best way I can say it, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4560.988s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, I don't think — you know, when this council — I think it was two budgets ago — voted $660,000 to be taken out of the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4567.425s">[Robert Penta]</a>: to not to absorb the water, 9% water rate increase from the MWRA that particular year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4572.888s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The mayor went nuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4573.628s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He didn't like that whole idea and he chastised us and he had all kinds of press releases sent out that we were, you know, weren't good people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4581.172s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We were against the taxpayers and this and that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4583.254s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We were for the taxpayers back then because that's what the money should have come out of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4587.716s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And unbeknownst to us, we didn't know that that 9% was taking place until the budget vote on that just before the budget was going to be proposed in that particular time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4595.842s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yes, Louise, you gave us this ahead of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4597.504s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I got no problem with that, but I can't support it in good conscience, knowing that that kind of a deficit is sitting there and knowing and just thinking about what's going on in the school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4608.774s">[Robert Penta]</a>: With all the new jobs that were just created this past year, over $500,000 in new administrative jobs, a $7,000 salary increase to someone because they're retiring to give them their highest three years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4621.264s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And when people start hearing that and knowing that those type of salaries are going out there, and when we're sitting on $7 million of their money, and they have to pay for raising their water and sewer rates, it's unacceptable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4632.593s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It doesn't fly by me, and I cannot and I will not support it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4637.804s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yeah, I support that the entire money comes out of the water and sewer account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4643.026s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But he says you can't do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4645.768s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'd like to amend the motion, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4647.969s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Amend the main motion that the entire deficit of whatever it might be comes out of the retained earnings of the water and sewer account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4655.772s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the amendment supersedes the main motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4660.334s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yes, you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4661.455s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's an amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=4664.385s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Move the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=5832.961s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm not supporting it tonight, but it's up to the council chair recognizes councilor Penta Louise, you, um, not you, excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=5841.906s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On November 4th, we received a letter from a solicitor Romley relating to this $300,000 request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=5850.251s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And he indicated that the payment is for all costs incidental and related to, well, whatever incidental and related to is, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=5857.355s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then he indicates,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=5859.28s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that it's including payments for all costs as it relates to the construction of this particular building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=5866.947s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, that was on November 4th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=5869.209s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You give us a paper on November 25th, but prior to November 25th, which was last week, I believe some of the questions were as follows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=5876.795s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Water leaks into the building, the air conditioning and the heating system were at awry, and there were problems ongoing over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=5883.341s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now you would just say that here tonight,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=5885.75s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that this payment is for the contractor because of the job that he did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=5890.854s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why would you be paying the contractor if you still have leaks in the building, you have an AC and a heating system still not operable?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=5896.779s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The building's not even a year old.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=5899.702s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Isn't it customary that there's always a holdback of X amount of dollars in construction contracts or projects until at least the warranty period is up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=5931.403s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How much are you holding back right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=5934.46s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're holding back, and you want another $300,000?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=5940.423s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you're not holding it back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=5941.984s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's nowhere else in reserve out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=5945.366s">[Robert Penta]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=5945.646s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So therefore, we would like to believe that this $14,800,000 building was supposedly paid for, however it was paid for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=5955.571s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now we're being told that there is an environmental aspect to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=5959.513s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the environmental aspect here that you're asking<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=5962.512s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The cost of the project for part, if not all of this money, seems to be contrary to the building paying the contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=5968.836s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What does the contract have to do with the environmental part of it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6021.858s">[Robert Penta]</a>: police on November 4th, the letter came forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6024.519s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It did not mention anything about heat, air conditioning, soil, environmental, nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6029.841s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It just says for, for incidentals relative there to very generic and it makes no sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6037.204s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm even surprised that the city solicitor would even write a letter like that without being more descriptive as it relates to why we're looking for the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6044.687s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But last week I think you heard what the concerns were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6047.14s">[Robert Penta]</a>: you know, what, what, what, what some of these things are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6050.082s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I, I just cannot believe this was Caldwell and Banker, Caldwell and Brown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6053.405s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is Brown and Caldwell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6054.826s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this is the same people that are in the West Medford area doing the city's parking lot over there, making an estimate of, of what should be done there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6075.021s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that second firm,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6078.931s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6080.593s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the $5,000 company reviewed the $100,000 company.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6083.996s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6084.337s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, that makes a lot of sense, but that's beside the point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6087.64s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I am not going to support this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6088.881s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This does not make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6090.283s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There is no reason in here as to why we should even be going forward with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6094.387s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if, in fact, they ran into a problem because they couldn't figure out<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6098.53s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In the landfill, I mean, how deep did they go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6101.952s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is it their requirement?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6103.573s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How deep did they go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6104.273s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Do you know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6111.937s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if they went as deep as they had to go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6113.838s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yes, to clean up the entire contamination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6116.039s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And why is all this coming up now as a cost factor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6132.605s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The actual cost you said is $975,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6137.868s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But now it's going to be another $300,000 over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6139.228s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, the $300,000 for the entire project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6232.942s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Can we get the questions regarding the leaks in the building and the air conditioning and the heating and everything else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6238.125s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There must be a punch list of things to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6613.023s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Chair recognizes Councilor Penta.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6614.604s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, I, I, Louise, I'm somewhat confused here right now because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6619.064s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're asking for $350,000 to close out the project, but you're also suing the contractor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6628.507s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're suing the engineering firm?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6629.928s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6630.268s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you're paying $350,000 to the contractor because you're alleging, or they're alleging, that there was additional rock that had to be removed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6640.792s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it cost $171,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6641.092s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the duck bank thing and $72,000<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6647.402s">[Robert Penta]</a>: detail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6647.982s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where was the city's person on this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6649.524s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Did the city from the engineer's office have a person on this job?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6653.206s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yes, we did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6654.947s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, didn't they anticipate this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6656.228s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If when they first started up on Winthrop street and got to the rotary, it was all rock going up and it was all rock going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6691.81s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're saying the engineering firm did not do what the contractor said or vice versa?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6704.904s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But while that's going on, but where was the city's person to say, what are you doing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6708.507s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can't do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6709.828s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're not following the contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6712.87s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why did they go through all this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6714.872s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Almost $300,000, $350,000 before they realized that they didn't do what they were supposed to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6732.032s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But as the project was being continued, where was the update from the city or from the person from the city?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6738.217s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This looks like it's all now after the fact, because once they got to the rotary there at Winthrop circle and they started to go forward on Winthrop street, further to the high school, that's when they hit all that ledge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6748.345s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That is correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6748.966s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Continuously, continuously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6750.427s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And we never got any updates on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6752.308s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And we never got any kind of notification as it related to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6755.431s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where was the city's person from the engineer's office?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6758.713s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Cassandra never told us about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6785.071s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So even though the contractor did all the work, was there a budget for the contractor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6791.43s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Was there an overrun in the budget for the contractor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6795.293s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now that was his overrun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6796.754s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Was there a specific dollar amount?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6798.235s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And once that dollar amount was met, it had to be renegotiated or was it an open end overrun?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6855.244s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So this is the same contract that we were going to pay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6857.704s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If I remember correctly, it was Councilor Knighthill alluded to way back when that they were putting this stuff all over the sidewalks and in front of people's homes and their trucks were all over the place and the green pipes were all up and down the street, but no penalty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6873.188s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I just don't understand how you can have a contract that doesn't have a penalty clause in there over and beyond, or if this has to be unanticipated work, a dollar amount and a beginning and an end date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6892.104s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Was there a time date to go to the dollar amount?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6896.468s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6896.668s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In other words, was it a month, two months, three months?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6898.81s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, if you're hitting ledge, it's quite obvious you're going to stop your<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6949.015s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Uh, I got no problem with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6950.115s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think we were asking for, as we did the last copy of the contract so we could see at them and the engineering contract, we asked for the solicitor to give us a copy of that so we could<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6958.649s">[Robert Penta]</a>: so we could review that, have a better understanding of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6961.931s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I guess my part that I just don't understand, because I'm not an expert anywhere in this particular area, but all I know is if you run into a snafu in any type of a contract, what overruns, whatever it might be, I believe that there was a beginning and an ending date and there's a penalty and a reward clause if you go over or beyond or if you don't exceed it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6980.905s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I don't hear that conversation being said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6982.906s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I agree with Councilor Longo to take it out of free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=6985.068s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I would support the amendment to take it out of free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7128.426s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, if anyone knows anything about the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7133.11s">[Robert Penta]</a>: the Medford Hillside up there by Tufts University where Sacred Heart Church used to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7137.772s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mark Spector and their Medford Hillside hardware store was well known.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7142.115s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He was a very good businessman, but he was also very kind and gentle to his neighbors in the community and to the church when the church was there and as well to Tufts University.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7152.28s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So he's certainly going to be missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7154.861s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's the second icon up there of a business person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7159.664s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Last year, it was the lady who owned Tasty Gourmet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7162.903s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Um, and now it's Mark Spector.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7164.864s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So hopefully, um, they're at peace and their family is somewhat comforted at this particular time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7497.141s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would be absolutely remiss if I did not say a few words about this gentleman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7501.383s">[Robert Penta]</a>: First of all, this is the gentleman who came down to a Medford Public Works building and made intentional lies about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7510.947s">[Robert Penta]</a>: me, Robert Penta, as a candidate for mayor in this past election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7514.848s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He basically went down there and said things that were absolutely not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7521.911s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're talking about, it most certainly is about your colleague.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7526.733s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He didn't do anything good because if he did say anything good, he wouldn't mind his business and he wouldn't spew out lies about a candidate running for office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7534.795s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I am talking about somebody, talking about somebody who had no right saying what they did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7539.957s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I am not, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7543.418s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Your city solicitor is well aware of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7548.5s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He even wrote a commentary as he relates to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7551.362s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You just can't go around talking about people and telling lies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7554.183s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's just what the gentleman did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7650.582s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, we're talking about acknowledgements and, and, and acknowledging people for what they did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IK8caXY8nKg&t=7655.983s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This gentleman is part of the same union who came to this city of Medford and harassed people and bullied people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=95.321s">[Robert Penta]</a>: One of the unfortunate things about this past election, it's over 3000 people didn't have an opportunity to vote on this because they weren't either instructed or they failed to turn over their ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=104.963s">[Robert Penta]</a>: which basically would have enlightened us as to what was the real true feeling of the folks here within this community, recognizing that it was a tax on top of the tax that they were already paying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=115.77s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I would hope when, when, and if in fact this committee ever does take place, um, that a complete explanation as to this five year commitment that needs to take place by the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=127.216s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Um, and unfortunately the taxpayers will not have an opportunity to have a choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=132.159s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It'll be the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=133.403s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that will be appointed, they don't make that choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=135.704s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the vote that took place this past November gave no indication as to what, if any, this money was going to be used for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=143.886s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And more importantly, and most importantly, the guarantee from the state is only at 18 percent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=149.088s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not at 100 percent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=150.188s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as a result of that, taxpayers for the next five years and this year happens to be the lowest of all the years that CPA, since it's been around since 2001, it's the lowest it's ever been.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=162.329s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if it continues to go in this mainstream, the taxpayers of this community are going to wind up paying for something that they never got their commitment back from the commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=170.896s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So unfortunately, the misinformation that went out there, the guarantee of the money coming back from the state is absolutely not there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=177.662s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The fact that it's a five-year commitment and the fact that almost 3,000 people failed to vote on this because they either not instructed or they didn't turn that ballot over, I just don't think it's a real true indication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=189.533s">[Robert Penta]</a>: of where the city wants to go on having another tax on top of a tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=193.735s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=194.035s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, if I may.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=239.789s">[Robert Penta]</a>: One of the things that the taxpayers need to be aware of is the fact that, yes, while it might have won by some 1,200 votes and 3,000 people didn't vote for it, the fact of the matter is they didn't have an opportunity to know what they were going to be voting for and on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=253.54s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's the difference between now and 2001.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=256.482s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So whenever this committee is set up,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=259.032s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think they really need to have a full-fledged understanding of maybe having some public meetings to take place to get an idea, and the five categories that are out there that it's offering, what the money can and will be used for, not because of the decision of a nine-member committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=274.555s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what I'm trying to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=275.935s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's the difference between then and now, and that's a big difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=811.43s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, I've got no problem supporting it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=813.892s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'd like to put a B paper attached to that because is there any kind of a law that exists out there that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=819.369s">[Robert Penta]</a>: holds and abeyance any service person's mortgage payments until such time that they come back home?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=826.335s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because sometimes if an individual goes overseas or is in the service and he has a family here and they just can't meet the financial obligations that are required of a mortgage payment, just like we're doing with the excise tax and the cars, is there any kind of law out there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=841.807s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Can we get an answer back?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=842.728s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is there some kind of law that holds and abeyance mortgage payments until such time as the service person comes back?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=854.951s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mortgage payments on their home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=860.515s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's why I asked for clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=862.236s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It may not be a function of the council, but it's a function if they have mortgage payments and then if the city wants to be generous enough, they can turn around and take their property tax assessment, whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=872.664s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Right now, we have so many servicemen, not only are coming home,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=877.158s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that have post-traumatic stress, that have physical infirmities, that they have so many disabilities that are confronting them, you know, and our government on a wholesale basis is just putting a lot of this stuff on hold while they're talking about bringing in, you know, illegal refugees and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=891.034s">[Robert Penta]</a>: things of that nature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=891.975s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if we're going to take care of people within our own community, I think we should look at what can be beneficial to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=897.94s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if it means filing a piece of legislation, then so be it, whether it's a property tax reduction or hold that in abatement or even a mortgage, um, uh, holding a mortgage in abatement, whatever it might be, they deserve to have that benefit, uh, available to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1870.283s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, we already have a rule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1872.424s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's rule number 20, disposition of all items appearing upon the council agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1877.006s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And referring back to what Councilor Alongo-Curran has just alluded to, I agree with her 100%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1881.909s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Section number four under rule 20 states that any financial paper appearing on the council agenda for the first time<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1887.323s">[Robert Penta]</a>: shall be automatically laid on the table for one week when such action is requested by any councillor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1892.884s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Common sense would tell you that we did this a couple of weeks ago because we got over $800,000 worth of a paper in front of the papers, three separate papers, to be voted upon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1902.466s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as a result of that, since we had received nothing in our informational packet on a Friday afternoon, we had laid that on the table with the hopes that we would get more and further information the following Tuesday, which was this past Tuesday evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1914.486s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Here it is again now the third Tuesday in a row.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1916.847s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And again, asked for the information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1918.949s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then we did not receive one scintilla, one document, anything that represents itself regarding those three papers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1925.352s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the council rules are obviously in operation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1929.235s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And after the seven days, if you've called a rule seven, a rule number four, excuse me, on the section four under rule 20, I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1935.638s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You'll be able to have any one council say, listen, we haven't gotten the paperwork in front of us, you know, and we're not going to entertain this any further until such time it comes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1942.515s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You already have the rules there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1944.796s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Sending it to the Rules Committee is nothing more than another delay tactic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1947.818s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You already have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1948.758s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's built into your rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1950.219s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And common sense will tell you, if the rule tells you how you're supposed to be operating, and you fail to get the information that you're supposed to be getting, well, then you take the very next step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1958.103s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You just lay it on the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1959.204s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You leave it on the table until such information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1961.745s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's what we have right before us right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1963.406s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have three papers that I would assume will just stay on the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1966.388s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We've asked for their information to be forthcoming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1968.725s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We've had the city audited, and then we had Louise Miller appear before us, and we still haven't gotten the information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1974.228s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I think right now it's operating pretty good, and it's right in front of us right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1979.03s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think council owes the obligation to the taxpayer, as Councilor Lungo-Koehn has alluded to, to not discuss that paper until we have an opportunity to receive the information to go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1988.474s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We don't have to wait for the next council to come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1990.415s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's happening right in front of you right now with three particular papers that you've asked for the information, you've laid it on the table,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1996.89s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You haven't gotten the information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=1998.331s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's three weeks running, and I don't know why, but if this is the way this administration wants to work, then so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=2003.793s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Hopefully, the new administration doesn't do the same thing, but this is what you have in front of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=2007.675s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These are our rules right now, and I think they're operating pretty good on these particular matters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=2011.976s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=2013.097s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you, Constable Benton.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3937.659s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3939.02s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Councilor Penta.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3940.8s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3941.58s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the paper that you have there, Jack, there's a question on the bottom of the line there that says, are there going to be any, I think restrictions as it relates to the parking and the second, they're going to make everything possible, but that's a city of Medford sign that's posted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3956.496s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that says no parking from seven in the morning to five at night, whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3960.598s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I'm assuming that since they didn't come before the council to get the permit, I mean, where do they go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3965.901s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The building department?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3966.962s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3976.087s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if they were issued from the DPW, I thought all permits that applied for would have to come before the council, Mr. Clark.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3981.49s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is that true?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3987.29s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's stuff to come, you have to open up a street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3989.491s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're opening up a street for Digley, for Gasley, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=3993.294s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're supposed to post a $10,000 bond as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4004.22s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're going to get that information tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4235.74s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, this is not the first time we've had to bring this up, and this seems to be an ongoing situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4241.024s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As you're coming up the exit to Roosevelt Circle going south down Route 93, it's a combination of the lights being off, and then once you go halfway around the circle, the lights are off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4250.791s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I know this was presented to Representative Donato before in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4254.974s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There was some concern about the state coming in there and doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4259.037s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Apparently, they still haven't found time to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4261.019s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a direct public safety hazard, especially for people going around that rotary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4265.767s">[Robert Penta]</a>: trying to take the right either to south border road or down to forest street in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4270.429s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's absolutely dark over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4272.19s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Um, the light's coming off the ramp and then on the opposite side of route.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4275.811s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So once again, I move that that be forwarded to the state department of public safety and have that forwarded to our representative, Mr. Donato, because we're supposed to have been taken care of and it's still not been addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4292.352s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Roll call vote, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4331.401s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As you're coming off the exit from Route 93 south.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4344.498s">[Robert Penta]</a>: take it on the right just before you take South border road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4353.347s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Say it again, Eddie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4356.43s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What was your amendment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4358.772s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Oh, to have representative Donato go back to the state department of public safety and put those lights back on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4364.478s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They were, this, this is months, this is running for months now that they haven't redressed them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4369.532s">[Robert Penta]</a>: are on the road, not all of them are out, but the ones that are really significantly out are the ones that take you halfway around the rotary, that take you to South border road and to Forestry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4421.901s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, the amount of things that are happening today out there and with youngsters not having<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4428.839s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Especially youngsters that might be coming from a single-family home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4432.682s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's just unfortunate that some of the programs that are offered are not being offered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4438.045s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It should be something that should be looked into.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4440.066s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as a result of that, I think it would serve us well to look forward either in through the private sector, the non-profits, because we have a whole bunch of those that take place when we do our community block grant funding, or also in our public and private school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4456.944s">[Robert Penta]</a>: programs that are out there that can serve a purpose that can mentor youngsters at an early age.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4465.046s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's a wild bill that's out there right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4467.206s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a Senate bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4468.587s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It passed the Senate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4469.287s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's on its way to the House.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4470.467s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I'm quite sure this might be brought up next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4473.168s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But it's sort of like it addresses, it calls itself age appropriate sexual content that's going to be mandated by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4483.505s">[Robert Penta]</a>: into our public school system for children 11 and 12 years of age.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4486.827s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's causing quite a controversy and quite a stir as it relates to what is going to be considered to be age appropriate and what is age appropriate for the certain part of sexual connotations and sexual education and anything that revolves itself around a child's either awareness or lack of awareness as to where he or she might be going or understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4509.947s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And these are the things I think that need to be addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4511.709s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, it's unfortunate when you have stuff like that, that they're trying to teach or educate you on, but they won't give you a civics class and make a mandated class to learn about your government, local, federal, and state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4523.318s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, it's kind of crazy in this day and age, especially, you know, you're trying to get people involved, and good government are having positions on government on issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4531.572s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So with that being said, Mr. President, I don't know what mentoring program the city of Medford has or even offers, but I'd like to get a report back from either the superintendent of schools and any private school organization here in the city of Medford that might offer a mentoring program for youngsters, could be troubled youngsters, youngsters from single parent homes, or just youngsters in general that have become available here to the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4559.193s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A mentoring program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4560.154s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mentoring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4560.754s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mentoring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4562.555s">[Robert Penta]</a>: M-E-N-T-O-R-I-N-G mentoring program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4566.438s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Sort of like a big brother, big sister, but it's something that's offered through education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4571.081s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If we have it and what is it and where is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4573.523s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So that, uh, in what entity is to give us this report?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4578.226s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, either the city, if the city has it, or if the school department has it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4611.187s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, that's just it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4612.167s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4613.107s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Are they after school programs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4615.288s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Are they scholastic type of programs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4617.459s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Are they athletic programs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4618.96s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Are they community awareness programs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4621.141s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a mentoring program that a kid gets after he's out of school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4625.463s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Or he might get it while he's in school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4627.884s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Specialized classes that relate to students that might have disabilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4631.866s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Are they having special mentoring programs that can make the child adapt to life-like situations?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4636.268s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Good evening, citizen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4850.345s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, most recently, the street sweeping program has taken off in a very inconsistent manner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4856.789s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Some folks, when they're having their streets swept, have had their cars ticketed and towed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4861.591s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Other streets, cars have not been ticketed and towed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4865.082s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And again, um, the, uh, allowing, uh, the notification, the notification, uh, the inconsistent notification of what streets, how and when, uh, to be taking place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4875.369s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Not everybody, number one has a computer and not everybody drives to the city of Medford to see the big sign that says a sweet stripping is going to begin on a, you know, there has to be a better program that it has to be identified and a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4887.54s">[Robert Penta]</a>: in a definitive way where people, like in other cities and towns, know on what particular week and what particular month and what particular side of the street it's going to get swept.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4897.246s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the tagging and the towing has got to be consistent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4899.528s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It just cannot be arbitrary and capricious at any point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4902.89s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So with that being said, I know the council has asked for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4905.611s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It goes back to 2014, and we still haven't gotten a program presented to us as to why and how the best method is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4912.515s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You just can't keep going around banging on trees<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4915.432s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, put your sawhorses up here, there, and everywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4918.314s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That just doesn't cut it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4920.335s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You need a comprehensive program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4922.416s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Same thing with the leaf pickup program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4924.077s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You need to have something that's comprehensive, it's established, people know what it is, whether they get it in their water bill, whether they get it in their tax bill, whether they get it online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4935.563s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Something that basically says this is the way it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4938.345s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this goes a long way with having signage that directs itself toward these particular issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4944.165s">[Robert Penta]</a>: City of Medford needs to get itself into a direct signage program that addresses a whole host of issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4949.966s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And again, what better way to have a signage program become operative?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4953.467s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It would be a great course to be taught up at the Medford Vocational School, where they could take during maybe the spring or the fall months of the year when the weather is good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4963.89s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Every single street in the city can be identified, the type of street that it is, whether it's a public street, whether it's a private street, the signage that's on there, take a picture of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4973.347s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, I made this offering about five years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4975.788s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was sent up to the vocational school, and the teacher at that time thought it was a great idea, but it never went any further.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4980.77s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4982.81s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, like so many things, you never find out why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4986.191s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They don't want to do things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4987.792s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But this is definitely a homegrown type of program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4991.713s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It can work well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4993.174s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It definitely would serve a purpose here in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=4995.735s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But when you have programs that are inconsistent, and you can't get an answer as to why I got a ticket and somebody else didn't get a ticket,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5002.628s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's sort of like unfair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5004.049s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Same thing with the parking kiosk program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5006.051s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's an unfair system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5007.092s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It doesn't work properly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5008.373s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Same thing with these parking program here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5011.055s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I'd like to make a request, Mr. President, that you would probably maybe have a committee of the whole meeting set up with, you know, the council, but ahead of time, have the council have their thoughts come forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5024.703s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And maybe open it up to the taxpayers of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5027.265s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maybe just have a, maybe a public hearing so it can be operative for next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5030.948s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A public hearing as it relates to setting up a designated suite streeping program here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5037.032s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So we don't have to go through this each and every year and you don't have to listen to the complaints and consistency and transparency will tell the whole story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5044.94s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So that would be my recommendation, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5295.945s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So on this paper, as amended by Councilor Naik, Councilor Penta.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5300.168s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, you know, doing something biannually doesn't make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5303.75s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's only twice a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5305.531s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, if you can have a program, you want it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5308.333s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There were some streets that had four sweet streepers on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5311.875s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Some streets, you're lucky if you saw one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5313.496s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, the logic, it's an inconsistent program that doesn't make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5319.1s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, Rick just got through saying, Councilor Caraviello got through saying,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5322.004s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that one of the employees in the Department of Public Works said there was no police officer available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5325.925s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What about the day that the police officer was available that was giving out tagging and towing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5330.226s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's so inconsistent and anyone who's gotten a ticket should appeal that ticket to the city because it's inconsistent as to what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5337.488s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You just can't run programs like this, like Councilor Briano just alluded to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5343.349s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How do you have transparency?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5344.629s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have a new guy coming on or a woman who's going to be a new DPW director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5348.872s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, there's got to be a direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5350.493s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this should be a high priority for direction that should be given to this new person coming on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5355.074s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can't run programs that are inconsistent and incompatible to what's supposed to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5360.216s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you need the signage that goes along with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5362.437s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you can't be Houdini trying to figure out what's going on if the streets aren't properly signed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5366.739s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's why it's a combination of signage and consistency to the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5370.841s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can't do it in reverse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5372.041s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can't have the program then decide to put the signage up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5374.642s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So that's why I would say, Mr. President,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5378.078s">[Robert Penta]</a>: committee of the whole meeting with DPW, you know, and the public to get some of their ideas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5383.32s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5384.161s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, you're, you're, you're going into a new adventure, bring them in, let them know that this is their city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5389.263s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This isn't a closed shop of ideas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=5999.037s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, one of the things that present this as an enticing matter is the technology and communication is ever-changing, whether it be on public access, whether it be the private enterprise system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6015.162s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But another thing that should be looked upon with this radio station is by making it something locally accessible, you want to encourage handicapped folks to have the same opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6025.984s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And one of the things that the speaker just mentioned, being at Cheviro Auditorium, whether it's there, the public library, someplace that's easily accessible on a bus route for whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6035.707s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The proposed location for the high school of the present time is not easily accessible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6039.868s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not handicap accessible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6041.995s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It has too many detriments running against it, especially late at night, evenings, winter time, inclement weather and what have you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6048.681s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But this idea of having a station where people can come and be heard and hopefully be the catalyst that eventually gets ourselves with a public access station, I think it's a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6059.75s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6060.951s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Number two, with the mayor sitting on over 300, I believe it's about $370,000 at the present time in public access money and not having public access in the city,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6070.38s">[Robert Penta]</a>: since December of 2013.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6072.001s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe this is the mayor's intentional failure to move forward on something that he is contractually bound to do according to the contract that he has not only with Comcast, but also with Verizon, who came on a couple of years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6086.565s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So what we're looking at is the idea of getting small equipment at a not a very large price.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6093.787s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're not looking at 4,000 to 5,000 square feet of space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6097.348s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're not looking at buying vehicles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6098.989s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're looking at something<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6100.363s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that can present not only an interest in this community, but it can present itself with accessibility because that's what's mandated in the contract that Comcast just signed with the mayor for another 10 years, unfortunately, another 10 years with the same vendor without having an opportunity to have this thing monitored even after the third or the fourth, fifth year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6119.15s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So with that being said, I think what we should do is to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6123.853s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think we need to do is to get the exact dollar amount as to what we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6127.794s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is coming into the fourth quarter of this year, and I don't think those monies will be readily available until January of next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6134.876s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So what our monies are as of September 30th of this year, that brings us to the third quarter for Verizon and Comcast, and the idea of having, and they don't have a public access or a cable access committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6149.559s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And without having a public access committee,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6152.466s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And only leaving this in the hands of the mayor, it's quite obvious that not only whether you were a candidate, not a candidate, or whether you were a person in the community who wanted to see your elected officials or a new candidate running for office, you lost that opportunity because we have no public access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6167.452s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you're being charged each and every month through your Verizon and your Comcast bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6172.114s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if this radio station is the beginning effort, if it's a catalyst to get ourselves going, I think it's a great move to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6181.009s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And with that being said, I would urge my colleagues to urge the president administration to go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6187.954s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And he's not going to respond back why he's not having public access, but it's another area to say, let's do this in the interest of not only public access, but it's also a public communication as it relates to what's going on here in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6201.685s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Every single person behind this rail, every single person on the other side of the rail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6205.525s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We'll have that opportunity to be on the radio, to be interviewed, or to possibly have a show that talks about our city of Medford, whether you like or dislike, and where we need to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6216.73s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I just don't understand why this administration was in such fear of having public access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6222.433s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I don't know what he could have possibly thought that public access was going to do to him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6227.375s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He's not serving in office anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6229.316s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He's retiring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6230.476s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So his office wasn't even that issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6234.158s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Every single council that's here that ran, that ran for reelection, every new council that was running, the school committee, they were denied a privilege.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6241.382s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They were denied their opportunity to go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6243.603s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's what public access is all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6245.924s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So here is another opportunity through the mechanisms of public access to have a public radio offering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6251.847s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I just think it's a great way to go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6254.088s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And Mr. Mayor, excuse me, Mr. President, I'm going to ask that you, and I don't know if you're going to be the incoming president,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6261.938s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, who the new president's going to be next year for the city council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6266.0s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, you might be the mayor, you never know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6267.7s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the fact of the matter is this, that whoever the president's gonna be should take the leadership role to move on this particular issue in the interest not only of public information, but just in the interest of the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6280.146s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Was it you, Councilor Camuso?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6281.186s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They just said they were, Marlin is having this televised for their football game coming up as they, was it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6287.789s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Oh, was it Joe?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6288.489s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You said it, I'm sorry, you said it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6291.999s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yeah, it's a big game, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6292.84s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, we don't have nobody to do our big game, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6295.402s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And we haven't had anybody to do our big game for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6297.964s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the sad part about it is each and every month you just keep paying out in your Verizon and your Comcast bills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6304.65s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6305.871s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the taxpayers of this community, the rate payers for cable television deserve better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6310.456s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They deserve to have their money used and used properly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6314.419s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So that's being said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6319.334s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, to send it to you, whoever the president's going to be next year, to enforce, to request of the mayor to go forward with a committee, which would be a cable committee that would serve in the best interest of this community, that not only addresses peg access by way of public television, but also public access and a radio system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6402.814s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, no, no, no, I said we've heard from the President, whether it be Councilor Dello Russo or whoever, if you want to take action before the end of the year, so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6410.278s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I think it definitely needs to have a public access committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6413.62s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think at your behest or whoever the President's behest is, they encourage the Mayor to go forward and put that committee together so we can go forward with public access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=6997.042s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as a result of, I, unfortunately, I don't believe she came to the meeting on that night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7001.337s">[Robert Penta]</a>: but the Republic people said at that point in time that they were going to have a meeting down there at the end of January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7007.22s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then they bumped it up to March and then they changed it to a, to a later date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7011.942s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think it was in May.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7013.723s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So with that being said, um, that was the purpose of, uh, the meeting of the senior center, uh, how and where would the seniors be able to park and what was the, uh, what was the process going to be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7026.729s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So they brought the kiosk down there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7066.634s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We'll be discussing that later on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7092.443s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What's that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7097.125s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. Clark, what is that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7121.602s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Refer this one, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7123.162s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Um, can we just leave that upstanding right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7126.103s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because it's the other one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7134.644s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7135.124s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Just, just merge them together because I was going to say merge these two together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7240.869s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Who's the next two on the table?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7426.341s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, earlier this evening, the Committee on Transportation met as it related to papers in committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7432.924s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And some of the things we discussed were the concerns as it relates to the Craddock Bridge, bus stops in Medford Square and in West Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7441.015s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and other ancillary matters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7443.897s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What was disturbing that came out of that meeting was when one of the, um, one of the, uh, business owners came in and indicated to us that, um, per his conversation with representative Donato, who had a conversation with somebody from the mass department of transportation, they have been meeting here with the city of Medford on a biweekly basis with a gentleman from the department of public works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7467.391s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that is very disturbing to hear that because right now nobody,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7470.947s">[Robert Penta]</a>: assert anything, we have asked on numerous occasions for some kind of transparency as it relates to what is going on, as it relates to not only the Karatek Bridge, the time schedule, the lighting, the closing down of the business, just having some basis of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7488.681s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We were also told and notified, and Councilor Caraviello, he can correct me on this, that the Chamber of Commerce hasn't even been a party to any kind of response or any kind of notification from the State Department of Transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7499.923s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That leaves a big void right now into trying to understand what is going on between the state department of transportation and their interaction here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7508.826s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If in fact the city of Medford is meeting with the state department of transportation and they are not notifying this council and the office of community development is not being notified and the business merchants aren't being notified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7520.169s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Chamber of commerce is not being notified and the council has asked on numerous occasions for an update as to what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7526.436s">[Robert Penta]</a>: there was a serious problem as it relates to that whole Craddock bridge operation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7531.098s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Another part of the committee report was asking, you know, it's supposed to be six days a week, double shifts, and everybody knows they're not down there six days a week, double shifts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7540.401s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So maybe that's the reason why it's taking two and a half years to maybe complete this, but further asking a question on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7547.244s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Also, I believe the bus stop as it relates to in West and South Medford, that's in front of Oasis,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7553.605s">[Robert Penta]</a>: the request to have it be moved across the street to where the dry cleaners is over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7558.409s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That seemed to be an understandable issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7561.391s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe that there will be a meeting set up in the South Medford area over there quickly as it relates to the bus stop, not only the bus stop moving, but a place for the business merchants when they have deliveries that take place over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7575.962s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I believe also the request and the concern was to go forward<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7580.726s">[Robert Penta]</a>: regarding the bus stops in Medford Square that would be coming down on Main Street and having them either detoured to Riverside Ave or River Street or whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7590.071s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But we got a notification, Mr. Clerk, you can correct me if I'm wrong, that the gentleman who now is in charge of bus stops with the T made an indication that he doesn't come out to nighttime meetings, is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7600.576s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And because he doesn't come out to nighttime meetings, this doesn't make any sense at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7604.693s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So we're going to have to figure out another way how to move them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7607.014s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And maybe our representative, Mr. Donato can make this guy understand it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7610.676s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, everyone works during the course of the day and you know, and that's part of their job to come to the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7616.459s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is a huge project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7618.08s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a new huge undertaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7619.861s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Bus stops are a huge issue as it relates to this, this whole undertaking as a result of their lack of transparency and coming forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7627.544s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe it was a vote of the committee for which council Lungo current,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7631.408s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and Michael Knox, and unfortunately he had to leave because of a family issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7636.85s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We made a request that a temporary cease and desist on the whole project of the Craddock Bridge become operative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7645.274s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's obvious that they're being absolutely non-responsive, non-responsive to the council, not responsive to anyone here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7652.036s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the sad part about it is if they really are meeting with somebody from the Department of Public Works,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7658.503s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And we're not being notified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7659.704s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And we have asked over and over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7662.266s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This shows you the complete breakdown that is taking place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7665.549s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the only way maybe to get their attention is to move, Mr. President, and ask for a temporary cease and desist to bring them to the table so we can have this discussion as to why we, the taxpayers, we, the council, we, the chamber, and we, the administration, aren't being brought up to date and being told it's up to date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7683.444s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, it's just an unfortunate matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7686.274s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Businesses are being affected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7687.355s">[Robert Penta]</a>: One business merchant came in there and indicated how he had it closed down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7690.677s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Lost over $3,000 worth of business on a particular night, the night that they put the bridge up, with no notification and what have you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7697.942s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So- Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7750.159s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So hopefully- Well, the gentleman that's now replaced the lady that was in charge of bus stops, I'll give you his number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7755.081s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'll give everybody his number if you want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7756.261s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Oh, I've spoken to him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7761.364s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But it won't make any difference who the legislative liaison is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7763.685s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The fact of the matter is this is all after the fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7766.326s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I know you have a meeting scheduled, I think, for next Tuesday?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7769.267s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7770.028s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Which is next Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7771.903s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think if they get the temperament that the council is not happy, and this seems to be a forced situation, these resolutions go back to June of this past year, September of this year, for which I've asked on numerous occasions, and other members of the council have expressed their disdain as to what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7788.25s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's absolutely, it seems to be a forced situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7791.372s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the only way to keep their feet to the fire is to let them know that not only are we upset, but we don't approve of what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7797.415s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And all this is is basically having a temporary restraining order against you,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7800.992s">[Robert Penta]</a>: to not do any more business until such time that you get this issue resolved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7804.735s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Who is the clerk of the works?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7805.916s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Who is the city's clerk of the works on this particular project?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7810.399s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We don't have any of these people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7811.7s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if we do, they must be mysterious people, because nobody knows who they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7816.704s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This council should be apprised through every part of that particular project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7820.547s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This has been going on since 2003, when Councilor Lungo-Koehn brought this resolution up for the very first time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7826.727s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is now 2015, 12 years later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7830.188s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the bridge did not sink in 12 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7832.729s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's been there for over 100 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7834.449s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's quite obvious that it'll make it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7836.43s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The fact of the matter is, Mr. President, sometimes you've got to push and be hard to make sure you get your questions resolved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7841.912s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So that's the result.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7843.312s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That was the report coming out of the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7845.653s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I'll move the question to the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=7848.414s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Madam Vice President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8181.712s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't think—I hear what you're saying, Councilor Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8183.813s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not sending out the wrong message.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8185.153s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's sending out a message that we're really upset that they have no way to operate like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8189.795s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But two points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8190.775s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The first one is this, that even if this were to happen, that back in the days—that's not true because they were supposed to be doing two shifts right from the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8199.938s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're lucky if they work three days a week, if they're working three to four right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8203.258s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and they're not doing double shifts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8204.759s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I'm not really worried about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8206.02s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm just more concerned over the fact that if, in fact, these meetings have taken place, then the responsible person in behalf of the city has failed to notify the appropriate authority, whether it be at the mayor's office, the council, OCD office, or whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8220.492s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the last part, Mr. Clerk, I forgot to mention, is to get the minutes of those meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8224.575s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe it's on there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8225.636s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The minutes of the meetings that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8227.494s">[Robert Penta]</a>: DOT has had whoever the city person is that has been to the meetings on this biweekly basis, you know, if, um, if a representative Donato has been told by DOT that the meeting has been taking place, uh, according to him, as he explained to one of the business vendors in the community, then, you know, something's going on here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8245.069s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Nobody knows nothing about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8246.11s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It doesn't make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8246.991s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's unfair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8248.252s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So with that being said, I'll hold off on a week until we, after the meeting of next Tuesday, and then, uh, let's just see where we're going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8254.778s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8255.689s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Hopefully, they'll be really forthcoming with some of these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8258.15s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're willing to budge and work with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8259.991s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Beyond that, you just hope the MBTA comes here, too, because you can't piecemeal this thing together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8265.174s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's not making any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8269.276s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, it's not that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8270.516s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's why we have our representatives and senators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8272.597s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is where their clout comes in, OK?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8274.819s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If they're really worth their salt as an elected official up in the statehouse, they'll get those people here from the MBTA, because they're not going to want to hear us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8350.391s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, the whole idea, Mr. President, is every single committee that's made a report has been voted upon and accepted by this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8355.573s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, all of a sudden, what are we going to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8357.173s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Go to a committee of the whole meeting and discuss what took place there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8359.874s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If the council wanted to be there, he walked right by, couldn't come into the room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8362.774s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The rules are the rules, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8364.155s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There may be rules, but you know something, Mr. President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8366.955s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let's be a little bit logical here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8368.276s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Read the rule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8368.856s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No report of a committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8370.088s">[Robert Penta]</a>: shall be received unless agreed to and a committee actually assembled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8373.633s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The committee was actually assembled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8375.216s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was the transportation committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8377.203s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It wasn't a committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8378.464s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Read rule 35, OK?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8380.264s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8417.13s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because I need to study it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8418.672s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I challenge the chair, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8421.138s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's quite obvious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8421.859s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that means that every single committee that meets and comes to this council floor and submits a report and submits a report and the council votes on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8430.544s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's those have all been illegal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8432.305s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is that what we're saying?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8433.226s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They've all been not right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8435.007s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That means every single committee that's gone and had a committee report and came back to this council, read the committee report and the council voted on it was done wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8443.072s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why are we doing this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8443.873s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And what do you even have a committee for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8461.889s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8462.509s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Be an obstructionist all you want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8464.15s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Move the paper, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8464.991s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's nothing wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8465.852s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Either that or change all the rules around here, because these committees mean absolutely nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8469.435s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I've read that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8469.815s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You've opposed it in every step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8470.836s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These mean absolutely nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ptMnNu2KUwo&t=8472.818s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Move the paper, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1109.584s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, I think in part we all know that around 5 o'clock or 5.30 this evening, I think we received the mayor's press release.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1120.506s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that he'd signed the contract with Republic from Tennessee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1123.708s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I'll get to that later on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1125.17s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's still part of the comparison.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1127.672s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, when we came on board at the beginning of the year, we were asked to give what our priorities were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1131.515s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I believe the police department and police station was our number one priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1136.018s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And unfortunately, it hasn't found itself anywhere in any of the mayor's agendas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1141.803s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, the police station would derive an extreme benefit for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1147.027s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It would make us go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1149.571s">[Robert Penta]</a>: not only socially, but as a community going forward with tomorrow's technology, and it would also give a presence of community policing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1160.516s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's something I think a lot of the people asking for, more police officers, more patrolmen, more visibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1167.699s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you give them a better place to work out of, then I think that would go a long way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1174.341s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, we paid in excess, I think, of $78,000<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1178.979s">[Robert Penta]</a>: when we received the feasibility study from the police department and the fire department on May 5th of this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1185.881s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And unfortunately for the police department, they didn't get anything out of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1189.182s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Fire department did, but the police department didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1192.864s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And once again, I don't know, maybe it's just the mayor, he doesn't have it on his radar screen, but public safety, I believe is the first of priorities here of any of all the councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1204.168s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Some of the things that Mr. Mayor, that would be beneficial, not only for our community,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1209.378s">[Robert Penta]</a>: is the council has supported, in each and every calendar budget, the recycling of two new cruises each and every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1218.363s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that would go a long way, once again, to add to the police officers on duty, driving their cruises, letting them know that the city is thinking about them, and they don't have to drive in a car that has about 140,000 miles on it, and they don't know if it's gonna make it or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1233.892s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think it was Councilor Marks, three years ago,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1238.24s">[Robert Penta]</a>: came up with the idea of why can't we have a special truck enforcement unit?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1241.321s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1243.522s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What's wrong with training one or two people to be involved with truck enforcement for that particular purpose?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1249.584s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because I think we can go down any one of these streets in any one of these days, and we see the amount of trucks that travel down High Street, Main Street, or the major streets here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1258.407s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That would go a long way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1260.588s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In our public safety issue regarding lighting, all the squares are just dimly lit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1266.069s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that in and of itself is an invitation<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1268.356s">[Robert Penta]</a>: for some type of crime, whatever the crime might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1271.358s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You get Route 16, the parking lot behind St.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1274.16s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Joe's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1274.981s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This will probably be the 14th time that we've discussed this, and still no lighting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1280.045s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We've had situations there where a lady called up and she was afraid to get into a car because of people there, and also in a separate situation where a drug transaction was reported.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1289.572s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Also right here in Medford Square, the Route 16 overpass, underpass on Route 93,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1294.71s">[Robert Penta]</a>: has no lights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1296.091s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Riverside Avenue, go underneath the overpass there, still no lights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1300.812s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have asked for the issue of public safety, timely street swiping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1305.514s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We've also asked for our crosswalk painting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1308.095s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're lucky if you see that once a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1310.856s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These aren't huge cost items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1312.756s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These are items that are readily available within our budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1316.538s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now we've talked about police cameras and high visibility locations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1321.151s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Were it not for the business merchant that owned a store on the corner of George and Winthrop Street a few years, a couple of years back, how they caught the guy that assaulted the young lady from Tufts University.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1333.255s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as a result of that, Mr. President, we all know that the cameras are beneficial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1338.22s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have $8,893 in our linkage account for where they could buy a few cameras.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1343.764s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if you really want to get into it, we have $6,400,000 in our free cash account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1348.967s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I don't think there should be any reason why we can't go out there and buy any cameras.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1354.371s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A bonus to our people that work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1357.433s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We can review the one day a week and swap day reward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1361.095s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that would be for those officers with a perfect attendance for six months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1365.238s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Something different, something creative for the police officers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1368.706s">[Robert Penta]</a>: rather than the annual, it's on a six month basis, and that might work out, it's a tryout, it's something to think about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1376.55s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think we should also think about revisiting the idea of having retired police personnel be part of the parking enforcement proposal here in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1384.815s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because that in and of itself, that in and of itself would bring a big luxury, not only to the people here in this community, but I think to the business people who would have a better idea of knowing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1397.748s">[Robert Penta]</a>: when and how to tag certain folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1400.089s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because we really don't know what this out-of-state company from Tennessee is going to be like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1404.952s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They could just be, I don't know, they're going to start at 7 o'clock in the morning to 7 at night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1408.674s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It doesn't make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1410.115s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Boston doesn't even start till 8 o'clock in the morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1413.217s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have a civil defense system that needs to be addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1416.418s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Since Mr. Mangone has passed on as its civil defense director, I don't know where it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1422.242s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is it in limbo?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1423.122s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is it going to be used?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1424.503s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If not,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1425.657s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We've talked about a snow emergency system, and we haven't heard anything back on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1429.099s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think we're all aware of the fact that a snow emergency system of some type needs to be in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1436.545s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And taking some of these issues and putting them on the left, then I go to the right, and I look at this idea of this new proposal that, if you agree or disagree, the mayor signed into effect apparently today regarding this Tennessee firm Republic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1455.834s">[Robert Penta]</a>: regarding a traffic enforcement program that's going to be six days a week from 7 in the morning to 7 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1462.839s">[Robert Penta]</a>: at night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1463.619s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There'll be no free parking on the streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1465.921s">[Robert Penta]</a>: According to the mayor's commentary, there's going to be two 30-minute parking spots in each one of the squares, and there'll be four paid single-space meter spots in each of the four square districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1481.652s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Other than that, there'll be kiosks allotted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1485.652s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's kind of like interesting because if you look at the commentary made by the director from the Medford Chamber of Commerce, Mr. White, he indicated that he was hoping that he would have an opportunity with its members to sit down and discuss this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1500.196s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And he also made reference to the fact that each and every one of the squares have unique positions, unique concerns as it relates to businesses and how they might be affected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1509.459s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How the mayor came up to this resolution and signing, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1513.459s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But it's kind of like unfair because we were in that meeting on September 10th, and we were told that he would get back to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1520.742s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We were told that there'd be a public meeting for which this council voted seven to nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1524.724s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He never honored that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1526.345s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We were told also that the concerns that would be brought up would be addressed and to have an idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1531.767s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know, and we don't really know what part of the business community, what businesses are going to be exempt from not having a meter or a kiosk anywhere in that particular area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1543.066s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You take these two things and you ask yourself, the Medford Police Department and public safety is such a huge issue here in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1550.709s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And some of the samples that I just talked about still have yet to be addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1554.971s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the mayor thinks it's more important to go forward with a parking enforcement program, strike that, a paid to park program with enforcement that's only going to bring in $300,000 the first year and $700,000 from the second to the ninth year, it's the 10th year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1572.406s">[Robert Penta]</a>: May sound like a lot of money, but my feeling personally would have been, had the city decided to go forward after that meeting on the 10th, having an opportunity to listen to the folks within our community, listen to the business in the community, all four areas of this community, rather than have one size fits all, which includes Medford Square, in the press release as outlined tonight at 510,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1599.947s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I just don't think it serves in the best interest of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1603.148s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't think it helps our police department, and I don't think it gives the community in and of itself a fair shot as it relates to priorities that need to be addressed rather than another money enhancement for the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1617.853s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, today, as you know, I'm assuming all of you know that the mayor signed this contract tonight around 517 or thereabouts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1628.397s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He signed the contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1629.758s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And he makes a notation that the council was in support of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1634.7s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What the council was in support of was that on May 20th, when we had that meeting, we had agreed to the three vendors that came in, one would be selected, which was Republic from Tennessee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1645.264s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But we agreed to that somebody would come back after he had negotiations and we would discuss it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1651.107s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And we did on September 10th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1652.988s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But when the pushback came back, the mayor decided not to go forward at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1657.709s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And speaking to Mr. Skelton,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1659.443s">[Robert Penta]</a>: are referring to Mr. Skelton's comments from Republic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1662.726s">[Robert Penta]</a>: From the 10th to the 25th of September, there was absolutely no communication between the mayor and Republic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1669.411s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So something had to take place from the 24th to today, the 7th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1673.915s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And taking that into consideration, it's quite obvious that the chamber's concerns, oh, I don't know who wrote the letter because we don't have a copy of the letter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1681.081s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He says he got a letter from the chamber.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1682.963s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But when you have four separate squares, including Medford Square, which makes five, and their issues are all unique,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1688.854s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and they needed to be heard, and they weren't heard, and the mayor decides to have one size fits all, I don't think that's what you call a happy resolution, especially to the business people and to the taxpayers of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1700.818s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, the fact of the matter is this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1705.679s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're getting rid of people who don't live in the community, who were parking at spots all day long, and they haven't been tagged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1713.322s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this has been going on for the entire years of the administration of this city, this mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1718.666s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And now what we're going to be doing is tagging, if not towing, and telling our own taxpayers in this community, you people are going to have to start paying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1728.072s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, right up front, no free parking unless you are lucky enough to get one of those two spots in any one of the four or five sections of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1737.278s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where it's going, I don't know, Mr. President, but all I can tell you is this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1741.381s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If I had to put my money on something, I would put it on public safety, the police department, the personnel that's needed to keep this community safe,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1749.039s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And more importantly, the subject matters that I brought up under the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1752.92s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Those to me are pressing needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1755.661s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They have no comparison, no comparison at all to a parking paid to park program or enforcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1763.163s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If the mayor was so concerned about that paid to park program and enforcement, he should have done it years ago, but he didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1768.884s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And when they knew that people from Winchester and other communities were coming here and parking all day and not getting tagged and ticketed, he should have done something, but he didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1777.607s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1778.148s">[Robert Penta]</a>: put $300,000 this first year out of the box, compare everything to what the police department needs to keep our community safe and protected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1786.535s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's pale in comparison.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1788.436s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And with that being said, Mr. President, I just wanted to say that, um, I just think, you know, this council is either going to be committed to public safety and a new PlayStation and the police department, or this is nothing more than hot air every Tuesday night when we come here to talk about public safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1804.54s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have more than enough examples.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1806.622s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think we have more than enough good police officers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1810.865s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The shooting is just a drop in the bucket compared to all the drug problems that are existing throughout this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1816.609s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's a concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1818.07s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if they had more personnel, and if they could go to court, and if they had more of the mechanisms and the technology that is needed, it would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1828.597s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, when you talk to someone, you say, hey, you're building a brand new public works department, $14 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1835.258s">[Robert Penta]</a>: $14 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1835.858s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Still don't even have enough men to man it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1839.159s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you have a police department that's ready to fall apart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1841.539s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have an evidence room that's completely out of control and a whole host of other issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1847.641s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So, I would say, Mr. President and my fellow colleagues, that I think it's time that we take the stand and we tell the mayor we want a new police station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1856.362s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't care how you fund it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1857.863s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You found the money for a public works department, then find the money for a police station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1861.883s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because you're not going to make one seem to be more important than another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1865.046s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And at the same time, you're not going to put the lives of this community and the folks in this community at risk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2711.653s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, um, I guess I missed this when I was reading it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2715.895s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you read the bottom of the mass comment, it says the chamber also acknowledged that there were several beneficial respects to the plan, such as user friendly kiosks, whatever that means.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2727.499s">[Robert Penta]</a>: After deliberating and discussing concerns raised by the business community, the mayor is recommending the following changes to the plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2735.962s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He's recommending,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2738.8s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This isn't a finality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2741.641s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you go to point number three, it says recommend $250,000 of the revenue generated on an annual basis to be dedicated to the business district improvements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2751.584s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a recommendation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2752.965s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This isn't a done deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2754.225s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you have $250,000, what district gets it first?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2757.506s">[Robert Penta]</a>: North Medford, South Medford, Boston Ave, Medford Square?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2761.447s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where's the determination there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2762.968s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then the last one, retain business and commuter permits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2765.609s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What does that mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2767.446s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All subjective commentary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2770.148s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't even know if this is really the done deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2773.031s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All he's doing, he's saying he signed it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2775.292s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I'm wondering if these are still things to be negotiated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2779.536s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He's recommending.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2781.057s">[Robert Penta]</a>: These are recommendations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2783.759s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They may be just sticking to the original part of the plan and getting back to what Councilor Marks alluded to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2789.324s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Not only is it going to be aggressive enforcement,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2793.302s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But why would you start at 7 o'clock in the morning?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2796.083s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Boston, which is much bigger than Medford, starts at 8.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2800.203s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Brookline, when they had their kiosks, they had to take them away because they were hurting the businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2806.344s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then if they're even recognizing by putting meters, single meters, in certain parts, well, maybe they should think about just putting meters, period, and see how that goes, and have local people do the enforcement part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2820.094s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the more I keep reading this thing, words stand off a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2823.136s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's the terminology that's used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2824.917s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He's recommending.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2826.037s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I don't even know if this is a done deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2827.758s">[Robert Penta]</a>: None of us know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2830.48s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's two 30-minute free parking spaces in West Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2835.243s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, who's in West Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2836.063s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Who's it going to be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2836.763s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Has that been determined yet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2837.684s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're going to flip a coin?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2840.085s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Go to Boston Avenue, you're going to flip a coin?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2842.587s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The whole length of that street, two free parking spaces?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2846.049s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then four paid single-space meter spots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2850.427s">[Robert Penta]</a>: in each of the above listed districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2853.969s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Who's going to get those four?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2855.791s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as I said before, what businesses are going to be excluded rather than included?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2861.995s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, the law is very specific on this, and I said it to you last week, and I'll say it to you again, and I said it to our chief procurement officer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2869.72s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The responsibility of bringing the contract forward was from the chief procurement officer, not from the mayor, and not from the budget director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2878.205s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what the law says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2879.71s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And there needed to be a recommendation in writing with a comparison of doing it in-house as compared to doing it out-house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2887.393s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And in this situation, we never got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2889.733s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We never got the recommendation and how that recommendation was determined so as for the council to make a legitimate vote to go forward to accept it or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2900.137s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So there's a whole host of issues that surround not only the mayor signing this or even getting to the point to having him sign it, but the fact that he lied<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2909.696s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He lied to we, the people, by not coming and having the public forum for which seven members of this council voted on, to at least have a public forum, to at least have the business community, and at least have the taxpayers, the residents of the community, to come and speak up about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2924.399s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think we're all getting our emails, and people are just, once again, hearing about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2928.44s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Some of them, not that they're for it, not some of them against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2931.4s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They want to know more about it and how it's going to work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2934.021s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But apparently, the mayor doesn't want us to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2936.707s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's quite obvious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2937.508s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He certainly doesn't want the taxpayers and the residents to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2940.449s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And however he chose what businesses that he met with, who knows what businesses they were that convinced him to go forward with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2947.554s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's a damn shame, because I don't think this serves in the best interest of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3388.617s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I have four questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3390.378s">[Robert Penta]</a>: First of all, you said that they took your quote out of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3394.301s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I'm going to read this quote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3395.322s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You tell me if it's accurate or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3397.363s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're going to let McGlynn quote, no, it's obvious to us that the different business districts have different needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3402.687s">[Robert Penta]</a>: White said, we're not going to advocate for any specific district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3406.39s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're going to provide opportunities through us to get those voices heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3409.752s">[Robert Penta]</a>: True or false?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3414.736s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if that's true, and you're recognizing the different needs of the different areas, how can you go along and have one size fits all for all four districts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3437.19s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3454.084s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's that part there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3456.446s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You said the chamber supports this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3457.887s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How many members in the chamber?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3480.727s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you have votes from the 200 plus members?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3484.168s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3484.868s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So how does the chamber make a decision?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3487.065s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you have membership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3489.427s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So your board of directors made this vote, not the membership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3503.515s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3504.196s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let's get this straight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3528.291s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You just made a comment at a minute ago that some of the people that are at that meeting on the 10th aren't members of the chamber.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3533.053s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3534.153s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So because someone is not a member of the chamber,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3537.096s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're not going to be looked upon with the same favor that somebody might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3540.218s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're a business person in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3548.804s">[Robert Penta]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3549.304s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You represent your members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3550.625s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you also said that the business community was aware of that meeting on the 20th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3554.828s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean on the 10th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3555.829s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3556.289s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3556.71s">[Robert Penta]</a>: At 117 in the afternoon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3558.131s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's when the emails went out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3560.632s">[Robert Penta]</a>: 117 of the day of the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3562.814s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And a lot of people didn't even get it because they were still at work and not knowing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3566.209s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So that's not a well-advanced notice of people — of a public meeting regarding their living.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3571.051s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3575.694s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. Kudlow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3580.957s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. Kudlow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3581.957s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Also, Mr. President, I do want to get back to this thing that if Mr. White feels, on behalf of his membership, that this one-size-fits-all is going to address the concerns<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3594.167s">[Robert Penta]</a>: of the five separate, the four squares and the downtown method.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3597.949s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'd like to have you explain that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3599.37s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How can this one size fits all?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3671.357s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So then your quote in the paper was wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3673.779s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You did not indicate that each part of the city is unique.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3695.036s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, I think we need to get a report back that are these four points recommendations, or are they actually part of the contract?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3704.162s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because it's the mayor who uses the term, he's recommending changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3708.43s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It doesn't say it's not definitive, it's recommending.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3712.334s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And with that being said, with recommendations, I don't know if it's a contract or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3717.758s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4073.869s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Clerk, do you have enough poll workers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4095.344s">[Robert Penta]</a>: During the last election, there was some concern over some of the ballot boxes not working.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4099.147s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is there any of these?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4102.988s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But aren't these all checked out before?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4105.169s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Oh yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4105.409s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4136.121s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Those all rechecked each and every election?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4138.782s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How does this work?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4152.212s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And for the sake of a public announcement, Mr. President, when can people start getting an absentee ballot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4246.071s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, Dorothy, as we all know, is our wonderful assistant in the clerk's office with Mr. Finn, and she works very hard through the years, and she's now being able to enjoy her grandchild, her son's first child, which would be her grandchild,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4260.587s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And we want to wish her the best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4665.085s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The only problem with the dog park has been the mayor is telling everyone it's going to cost $200,000 and he's telling people to go out and do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4672.391s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, I mean, how do you turn around and tell the people you go out and get the dog park?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4676.935s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as Councilor Marks alluded to before, you know, RF Whiting Company,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4680.72s">[Robert Penta]</a>: according to the mayor, was supposed to give the money for the dog park, and they never did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4684.162s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And now he's telling the people, you've got to raise the $200,000 if you really want this dog park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4689.904s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He knows how to raise money for everything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4693.426s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4695.047s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think the good part is maybe, Mr. Clerk, if we have just a single number they can call the clerk's office, and maybe you should have a stack of petitions there if people come in, because that's where the licenses are as well, too, to pick up a license in your office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4710.845s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I can't generate the petitions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4712.306s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, no, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4713.427s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If petitions are left in your office, if petitions are left in your office and somebody wants to come and pick them up, they can pick them up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4719.731s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think that may be a good idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4723.553s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Central point in the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4807.91s">[Robert Penta]</a>: President, yesterday, well, I think it was yesterday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4812.873s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I got mine yesterday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4813.733s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Other people may have got it the day before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4815.754s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We all received in the mail our new water bill, and we also received a letter from the city indicating to the city of Medford water and sewer customers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4826.601s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, the letter is undated,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4829.036s">[Robert Penta]</a>: right there in and of itself tends to indicate a lack of professionalism in the letter going out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4837.779s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There was no notice of a public meeting or an agenda item on this particular matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4843.801s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The Medford City Council not only has talked about it, but at our April meeting of this year, we had a resolution that was offered by myself and passed by the seven members of the council to have the cemetery, no, excuse me,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4858.663s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The Water and Soil Commission has appeared before the council and to explain this new idea of tiered rates and commercial rates or whatever it might be and however it's going to take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4869.312s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4870.793s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Unfortunately, the mayor sends an answer back and says it's the council's purview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4876.618s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, it's the Water and Soil Commission's purview to make that decision, number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4881.141s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And number two, this is a matter that involves the entire city for the purposes of being involved and getting involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4889.346s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The council has asked on numerous occasions for the Water and Soil Commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4893.609s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I personally have met with the chairman of the Water and Soil Commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4897.272s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I asked him to come here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4898.353s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're still waiting for him to come here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4901.376s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The mayor has never offered a public meeting or a hearing on this particular increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4907.22s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So there is a complete lack of public education on this increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4911.664s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as a result of this, we have problems here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4916.408s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Look at your bill that just came out, and it talks about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4920.526s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The rates only apply to homes with up to four families and residential condo buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4926.05s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then it gives you a 0 to 800 as a base.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4929.493s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I don't know where they got that 800 as being the base.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4932.215s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Again, no determination from that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4934.196s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then from 800 cubic feet to 1,600 feet, you get to another rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4938.62s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it goes on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4939.54s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And after that, there's a third rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4941.222s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So as a residential owner, you could have up to three types of rates in your particular house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4946.646s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then it goes down further to indicate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4949.122s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Every other person or every other type of an account will be charged 0.138.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4954.786s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, does that mean that that's going to be a commercial rate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4960.309s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I thought we were led to believe that there was going to be allegedly a commercial rate, which would be different than the regular rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4967.853s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if you go back to the first paragraph, they talk about they're adopting this in response to Chapter 165, Section 2B.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4972.836s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And 165, Section 2B is very explicit<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4979.343s">[Robert Penta]</a>: where it talks about, shall institute water charges and fees that incorporate a base rate for all, provided, which means other than or maybe, that said base rate shall be increased at an increased block rate to fairly reflect the resource demand and consumption of high volume uses of water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5002.576s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now think about high volume uses of water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5007.475s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you live in a three-family house, for the example that they use, you are a single person on the first floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5014.861s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There is two, three people on the third floor, five or six people on the third floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5019.425s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And they use the example you used, 2,100 units of water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5023.068s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, they're going to take the 2,100 units of water, divide it by three, and everybody's going to be tagged with 700 units of water to be charged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5031.936s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That doesn't make any sense at all, number one, because number one,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5036.306s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Not everybody has a meter in their apartment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5038.346s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if it's a single meter that's going to cover the whole house, some houses are like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5043.948s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, how do you distribute that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5046.508s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, where they come up with this, I have absolutely no idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5050.969s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And this is what prompted probably eight or nine of my 13 calls that I've already received so far in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5056.65s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How do they make this type of a determination?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5058.751s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But more importantly, personally, I think this is the mayor's way of retaliating against the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5064.619s">[Robert Penta]</a>: because we didn't give him his $600,000 in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5067.981s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Bad enough we didn't give him his parking garage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5070.103s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as a result of that, this rate increase not only will pick up the $600,000, it'll probably exceed that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5077.168s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Absolutely, absolutely not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5080.15s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It is not right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5081.751s">[Robert Penta]</a>: At the present time, people should be aware of the fact, at the present time, in our water and sewer retained earnings account, we have $8,400,000 as of today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5096.533s">[Robert Penta]</a>: $8,400,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5098.275s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We would have $9,600,000 if we didn't take a million two a few years ago to take the mayor out of his deficit hole because he couldn't balance the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5107.762s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But with that being said, $8 million, that's a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5113.366s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And we're talking about rate payers having to be charged right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5117.549s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There is nothing in this letter that would even give you an assumption<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5122.301s">[Robert Penta]</a>: that it's going to take place next year, or the next billing cycle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5125.963s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They just jam it in the letter, and there it is in your new bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5131.046s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, I went back, and to my knowledge, the last time in billing cycles in 2006, as compared to the bills that we have right now, the 2006 bill, sixth bill, tells you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5144.895s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The cost, it breaks it down for water and sewer, the cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5149.277s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Your water and sewer cost is not broken down in these blue bills that we've been getting for a long period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5155.381s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as a result of that, I'm going to suggest in part, Mr. President, that the city's water and sewer department and the city of Medford building department reinstitute the prior building process that not only showed the prior readings, the present readings, the usage,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5173.311s">[Robert Penta]</a>: but the rates for water and the rates for sewer per 100 cubic feet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5177.955s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the people have an informed, knowledgeable bill, rather than getting a dollar amount and trying to figure out the hocus pocus that's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5187.281s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Baseline water usage of 800, where do they get that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5190.484s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I have absolutely no idea who determined, and they don't even tell you where it came from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5197.089s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The bill, as I said before, it doesn't ID the water and sewer rates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5200.435s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But back and prior to 2006, it did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5202.977s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It gives you everything that you would want to know to try to figure out your bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5208.221s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, your old rate consumption as compared to your new rate consumption, that's another thing that's not on here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5214.767s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because all they're doing and they're telling you on the blue bill, it's just telling you what you had last time, what the reading was, and the amount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5226.276s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And once again, what's water, what's sewer, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5232.566s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think what really needs to be done on this particular issue is two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5237.55s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You can't send out bills to people and just tell them it becomes effective now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5243.555s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5244.315s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Number two, you don't send out a letter that's undated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5247.197s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Number three, you don't turn around and tell, for an example, a three-family house, you're going to split it between the three floors, and everyone's going to pay the same amount on a per-unit charge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5256.965s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5258.806s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Second of all, there's nothing on this bill<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5261.719s">[Robert Penta]</a>: on this letter that talks about a commercial rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5266.141s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think Councilor Marks, is he here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5268.382s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think there was an issue relative to a commercial rate before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5271.543s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, where are we going with that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5273.664s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It says all other rates will be 0.1381.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5275.925s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that will be the same rate as someone who goes from the 800 to the 1600 level in a residential home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5285.829s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I said it before and I'll say it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5287.97s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If families are going to be penalized because they have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5291.272s">[Robert Penta]</a>: children or mothers and fathers or seniors living with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5295.695s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5297.036s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's absolutely not fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5298.497s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as the law says, the resources should go on the demand and the consumption of high volume uses of water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5307.063s">[Robert Penta]</a>: A residential home, maybe just over this 800 level or whatever it might be, those aren't high uses of water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5314.828s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's baseline wherever they got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5317.089s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maybe the zero to 800.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5318.769s">[Robert Penta]</a>: should be maybe the $0 to $1,200 or $1,400, and then change it after that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5323.911s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because I don't think it's bad enough rate payers, you're hitting them with a federal tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5327.672s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You hit them with your state tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5329.013s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You hit them with a meals tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5330.033s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're hitting them with a gas tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5331.614s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You hit them with your real estate tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5333.494s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And now you want to raise their water and sewer tax with an $8.4 million surplus sitting in a kitty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5341.717s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5343.358s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is not what the council asked for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5345.318s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe this is the mayor's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5347.443s">[Robert Penta]</a>: way of getting back at the council because $600,000 was taken out of the budget for which the council voted for to knock off the 10% rate increase?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5357.691s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, this rate increase is definitely going to exceed the 10% that the mayor was losing, or the $600,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5364.436s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And who's going to pay for it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5366.638s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's the everyday person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5368.779s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would strongly suggest, Mr. President, once again, as we did in August, if the mayor says this is within the purview of the council,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5376.84s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then let it be in the purview and strike that respectfully request that the Board of Commissioners appear before the Medford City Council for the purposes of explaining not only the letter, but the rates as to where we're going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5389.863s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And also respectfully request that they change their billing process to accurately show the rate for water, the rate for sewer, where it's going, and the amount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5400.945s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now with that being said, Mr. President,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5403.911s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I can't find anyone, and I'm still waiting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5405.872s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I had a long talk today with Mr. Remsburg, who was the chief legal counsel for the MWRA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5411.994s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And in my conversation with him, which represented the same type of conversation I had with him in August of this past year, we're back to the same issue for which I believe we're on the same page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5422.577s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The bigger users, the demand for bigger users and demand for more consumption and high volume of users of water should be the first ones, according to this chapter of the law, to be paid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5433.882s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It says, all municipalities and water districts within the jurisdiction of the MWRA, but not including community service by the Connecticut Valley Aqueduct, shall institute water charges and fees that incorporate a base rate for all users.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5450.174s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5450.854s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're saying 800 is the base rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5453.176s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But it says, provided that said base rate shall be increased at an increasing block rate to fairly recollect<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5461.909s">[Robert Penta]</a>: the resources, demand, and consumption of high-volume uses of water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5467.072s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If somebody is 801, is they going to be tagged as a high-volume use of water?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5472.074s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because that person at 801, which could be residential, is going to be tagged at the same amount that everyone else is going to be tagged that's not residential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5482.059s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you're going to have to assume it's commercial, because they don't say it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5484.741s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But what is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5487.082s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Everybody else but residential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5488.703s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's got to be commercial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5490.463s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So with that being said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5492.191s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think this needs to be addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5494.312s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think somebody needs to be here to address it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5496.474s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think the billing needs to be addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5498.215s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And more importantly, I think it's absolutely unfair that somebody would put a, an increase in your bill on the same time that goes out with no public education, no public notice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5511.223s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, this is three strikes that the mayor has given to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5515.926s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He's taking money away from people on cable access on Verizon and Comcast bills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5521.547s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He's sitting on $303,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5522.448s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's sitting downstairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5525.489s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He just now signs, he just now signs a pay to park program that didn't have one public hearing here for the taxpayers to talk about and discuss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5534.955s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And thirdly, he's now hitting you with a new tax on your water and sewer charge with no public input, no public information, no public hearing or anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5545.34s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's three strikes since the summer of this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5549.028s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How much more is it that the people of this community want to take?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5552.35s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When are you going to realize that your open government is not open like you think it is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5557.532s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And your notorious government is as notorious as it can be, because there's no transparency as to what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5565.216s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This letter should have been ID'd with a date, and it should have addressed itself DMF resident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5572.16s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In the near future, giving it the date, your bill will be going up the following, and it'll give the reason why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5578.325s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But the insanity of saying that a three-family or a two-family or a four-family house is going to be divided by the amount of units, and that's what they're going to pay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5587.372s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They have no right saying that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5588.413s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They have no right doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5589.874s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So with that being said, Mr. President, I'm moving that our Board of Water and Soil Commissioners appear before the Medford City Council to discuss this particular matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5743.391s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I hear what Councilor Knight is talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5746.032s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My point of clarification is this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5747.513s">[Robert Penta]</a>: While he may be running off a string of resolutions, we had asked for a public hearing and a public meeting on this and for whatever<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5755.629s">[Robert Penta]</a>: the Water and Soil Commissioners might have done or made the determination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5759.652s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The council has been asked to be apprised, and they've been asked to appear before here, and they never have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5765.217s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So 800 getting to the baseline, how did you get to it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5769.16s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where did you come up with that number?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5770.961s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because if you look at a lot of the residential homes, they're going to be between 800 and that 1,600 mark.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5776.326s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So by going over by one cubic feet, you're going to be putting that residential homeowner, who might have two or three kids or taking care of a senior citizen, paying a higher rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5786.059s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And that's where I think the discussion needs to take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5789.82s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm not denying the fact that the more you use, the more you should pay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5794.121s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But this is a big gap from $800 to $800 to $1,600.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5798.603s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if you are just a little bit over that, you're going to be saddled with that additional thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5802.984s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And again, as I said, if somebody has multiple people living in their family home, they're going to be penalized for using the water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5809.005s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If they use a dramatic amount, that's one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5926.949s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yeah, clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5927.669s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5928.549s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I hear what Councilor Knight is alluding to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5930.53s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The point is valid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5932.711s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It went from zero to 1,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5934.131s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why did it come down to 800?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5935.812s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, if you speak to some of the members, they're going to turn around and tell you, this is part of the conservation mode of saving water and within families and stuff like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5944.434s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Which I wholeheartedly support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5945.875s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5946.315s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I don't think anybody's going to deny the fact that, you know, you don't want to penalize people because they have people living in their homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5952.81s">[Robert Penta]</a>: who might be seniors or elderly or babies or two or three children or for whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5958.957s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I would be not in favor of having a subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5963.002s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I would be in favor of just having, calling for the public hearing and have them come in and explain it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5967.007s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They've already mean what they did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5969.149s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And one point further, and I think as a Councilor, Councilor Marks, I think we had this conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5974.636s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Getting to the point of the households, as Councilor Knight has just alluded to, how did you make this determination?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5981.902s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where are the numbers of those homes that are between 0 to 800, and from 800 to 1,600, and over that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5989.069s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They have to have statistics to do that, because if they just decided to go to 800 because it sounded good, because it was a good conservation move, well, that's not good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5998.536s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If there's people between 800 and 850, whatever it might be, there's nothing wrong with going to 1,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6002.859s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, that's a compromise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6004.199s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I got no problem with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6005.56s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But I want to see these numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6007.781s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I want to see these numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6033.314s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Thank you for your point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6034.315s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I just remind councilor Dello Russo, one thing we had asked at one point in time,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6039.093s">[Robert Penta]</a>: to have our city engineer appear before the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6041.393s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And she didn't come because the mayor told her not to come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6043.934s">[Robert Penta]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6044.474s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So we can ask the Water and Soil Commissioners to come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6047.995s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But if they choose not to come because they're told not to come, where does that put the council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6534.51s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Point of clarification, Councilor Penta.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6536.29s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The law says explicitly if the estimated income is more than the total appropriations, the excess shall be appropriated to a separate reserve fund and used for capital expenditures of the enterprise subject to the appropriation or to reduce user charges if authorized by the appropriate entity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6554.602s">[Robert Penta]</a>: responsible for operations of the enterprise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6559.265s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He can the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6561.047s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6705.164s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, also the letter indicates further down that they're going to keep this baseline rate for the first year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6711.988s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the intention is that they're going to be going up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6714.749s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So with that being said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6716.6s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm going to make the request that the Board of Water and Soil Commissioners appear before the Medford City Council to discuss this letter that went out that's unsigned, undated, as it represents, and that a new bill be forthcoming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6735.186s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They revised the bill that includes the rate for the water and the rate for the sewage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6742.961s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and along with the total amount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6744.823s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Also, the letter negates to put in here that it's nothing more than the new use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6749.746s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They don't have the old use by consumption and water and sewer charges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6754.25s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think that would be, once again, pure transparency for the rate payers at least to see what's going on other than, once again, just getting a letter saying, you know, this is what you're going to have to pay and your rates are going up and, you know, with no clarification, absolutely no education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6769.241s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There was absolutely nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6770.863s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You notice that the mayor did not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6772.885s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Listen, the Board of Soil Commissioners worked for the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6775.266s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They're his appointments on that board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6777.208s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The mayor owns this one as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6778.609s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is his responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6780.27s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If he knew the rates were going up, for which they have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6783.332s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if this is his end run to circumvent this council, because this council wouldn't give him his parking garage and wouldn't give him his $600,000 in the budget for 10% water rate increase, this is certainly the wrong way to go, especially with $8.4 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6799.722s">[Robert Penta]</a>: sitting in the surplus account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6801.564s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That is just so wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6803.926s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, you're ripping off the taxpayers once again, Mr. Mayor, knowing that their money is just sitting in an account to make you look good at a bond rating at the expense of the taxpayers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6816.956s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maybe they'd like to enjoy some of that money and spend it on their family or their kids or what have you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6822.481s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So with that being said, I move the question, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6870.323s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I can go either way because it's obvious that this has already been done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6873.446s">[Robert Penta]</a>: From the documents that I have secured from the Water and Sewer Commission, they've been talking about this since April of this past year with the city engineer and Mr. Woodcock, the MWRA, the legal counsel, and what have you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6884.707s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So their determination has already been made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6886.628s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My question is going to be very simple and germane, basically what we had here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6890.209s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, the one thing, you know, they're saying that they cannot make the recommendation to reduce the water and sewer rates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6899.713s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, if they can't make the recommendation to reduce it, how can they make the recommendation to increase it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6904.535s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It doesn't make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6905.816s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The law doesn't prohibit them from doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6907.916s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And with an $8.4 million surplus, in the best interest of this community,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6912.062s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It would have been a wonderful exposure by the Water and Soil Commission to recommend to the mayor that we not increase and we take this out of the Water and Soil account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6920.269s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But as we all know, this is the mayor's board, and they're going to do whatever the mayor tells them to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6924.793s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I can go either way on the resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6994.682s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Councilor Penta.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6995.722s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6996.202s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I got no problem with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6999.349s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We only have three more meetings between now and we're off for two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7002.271s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I would request that this meeting take place within the next two to three week, next two to three meetings that were available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7008.496s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But in the meantime, if we could have some information forwarded to us so we could at least know the proposed that they're giving us here, how they got to this baseline of 800, if we could get some information on how they got to that, if we get some information ahead of time, once again, what's the old rate compared to the new rates?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7029.825s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And something as it relates to, you know, revising the bill that includes the water rates for water and sewer usage and the dollar amount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7039.671s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So at least when somebody gets it, they could figure it out rather than just getting numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7044.033s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then the conversation on that particular night would just basically, you know, figure out the tiered rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7051.158s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This lacks the word commercial rate in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7054.219s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It says all other, all other establishments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7059.485s">[Robert Penta]</a>: which I'm assuming is going to be commercial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7062.327s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We'll find that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7063.709s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So if we could have that and a roll call vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=114.915s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On that motion, Councilor Dello Russo's amendment, we just got a notice I think today relative to a meeting that's going to take place on June 3rd by the folks that are doing the work over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=125.444s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So that may be something you may want to bring up for the purpose of letting them pay to do the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=132.649s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So it's in your, pardon me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=134.09s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You want to amend that further?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=134.891s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yeah, amend it further, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=137.383s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why don't you repeat that again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=138.705s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The amendment is that the Department of Transportation is having a public meeting on June 3rd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=142.97s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I believe it's in Boston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=144.432s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We got a notice today in our emails.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=146.474s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's one of six locations, that's the next one coming up, and that will make reference to Councilor Camuso's and Councilor De La Rosa's thoughts relative to Medford Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=869.451s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On that motion, could we get a copy of where the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=875.071s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Dog packs and the amount of money was supposed to be coming from October of 2011.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=879.395s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The mayor made a public announcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=883.058s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We've been talking about dog packs since 2011, because that was supposed to have been part of the mitigation that F.W.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=889.884s">[Robert Penta]</a>: White, or J.F.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=890.605s">[Robert Penta]</a>: White, was supposed to be giving the city of Medford for the FAST-14.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=893.847s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So we've never seen the dog pack.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=896.169s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Could we just get the handle on what that mitigation terminology was on dog packs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=901.957s">[Robert Penta]</a>: $50,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=902.077s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I have no idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1230.836s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President last Tuesday night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1232.357s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Um, I thought we had a very informative conversation and after I went back and I reviewed the tape, um, I, I, I think to some degree we will mislead or at least I was misled because I asked the question as a related is the new location on Salem street going to have the capacity<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1249.502s">[Robert Penta]</a>: to do a broadcast from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1251.983s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the answer was yes from the manager of the station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1257.945s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, subsequent to that, immediately following the meeting, the transmission of the module, or whatever you want to call the terminology, was in the corner of the room over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1267.888s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the conversation finally alluded to the fact that on Riverside Avenue, there is absolutely no Comcast, and there is no Verizon capacity to do broadcasting or to bring cable in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1279.687s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, if you remember correctly, Mr. President, it was you who brought up this issue, I think some five to seven years ago, relative to a business client on High Street who was trying to get Comcast, I think, or Verizon, into the building over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1295.113s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was Comcast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1296.774s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And at that point in time, I believe there was, in our conversation, I believe we had someone from Channel 3, and I don't know who, so I don't want to mention any names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1308.291s">[Robert Penta]</a>: because I'd be absolutely wrong, but I remember somebody from Channel 3 indicating that that was one of the problems that we had in Medford Square, the inability or the lack of capacity to have broadcasting in the downtown Medford Square area, which seems to be pretty kind of evident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1320.658s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, again, from the conversation that took place last Tuesday night and from the information that was ascertained, there is a two-year contract signed, I believe, at 32 Salem Street, Riverside Avenue, excuse me,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1333.507s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's no Comcast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1334.348s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's no Verizon there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1336.109s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So how do you broadcast out of have a full-fledged studio if you don't have that capacity to broadcast from there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1343.775s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So what's going on now, if I understand all of this correctly, is the modular transmission, lack of terminology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1350.441s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know the proper terminology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1352.362s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But it's here in this particular building, or it was brought here in this particular building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1357.406s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know if it's still here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1358.902s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the whole idea is that the transmission would come from Verizon or Comcast to City Hall, and then they would somehow bounce it to 32 Riverside Avenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1369.727s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I'm saying to myself, well, wait a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1371.308s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What is this all about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1373.629s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is not having a full-fledged studio that's equipped on its own merits at its own location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1379.251s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Then I started to think about this thing even more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1380.952s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I'm saying to myself, we have a concern here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1384.054s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We're putting channel-free equipment into Medford City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1387.915s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And by putting Channel 3 equipment into Medford City Hall, are we talking about having a liability issue here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1393.379s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Are we talking about the equipment here in City Hall?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1395.881s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Are we talking about the access to City Hall?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1398.062s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The keys and who would have keys to City Hall?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1400.184s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Who would be coming into City Hall if, in fact, something were to go wrong in the transmission from City Hall to 32 Riverside Avenue?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1408.009s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And there's a whole host of questions here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1409.471s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the city has a liability policy as it relates to being a self-insured.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1413.433s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, we all know that Channel 3 is a separate private nonprofit corporation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1417.611s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So, I mean, we have two separate entities here running around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1421.674s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We were also told at that point in time that there was, I believe, less than $100,000 operating budget that they were operating in, but there is another budget for whatever that might be worth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1434.682s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I tried to get down there on two separate occasions on Riverside Avenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1437.624s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Both times I couldn't get in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1438.845s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Both times the door was locked, but on one particular day,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1442.022s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The paper was down, I did have a chance to look in, and it didn't look like there was hardly any work, if any work at all was taking place down there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1447.724s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now this goes back to March of this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1450.345s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So now we have a station manager that's getting paid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1452.586s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have no transmission, no broadcasting coming forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1455.628s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have, for whatever the reason might be, if in fact the city of Medford is now being a part of whatever Channel 3 is going to be involved with, if the mayor is doing this, I have no idea why Channel 3 would even be here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1467.031s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and entertaining City Hall, but more importantly, why would they even want to stay on Riverside Avenue with no access to cable television, Verizon or Comcast?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1477.038s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, poor choice, they've been around, they know the situation, they know what Medford Square is about, they know what Riverside Ave is all about, and that was a poor choice to go there, especially being in the business for, they're not novice, these people that are working there, and they're a part of Channel 3, they've been around for a while, they know what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1495.424s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And since they know what's going on, the sad part about this is they've got themselves locked into a contract for which I would assume, I would hope that they would be able to get out of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1503.169s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And even if they had to get sued, who cares about getting sued?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1506.211s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Look at the time that you're costing the city, the taxpayers, each of the rate payers, each and every cable bill are paying for something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1512.096s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're paying for station manager that has no job to do because there's nothing being programmed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1516.038s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's nothing being taped.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1517.878s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then it dawned on me yesterday while we were at the cemetery and we were listening to the speeches being made and watching the people that were there and the observance, where is all this portable equipment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1528.108s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The portable equipment that Channel 3 has had through the years from the thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars that subscribers have not only paid, but the city of Medford has transferred over to Channel 3 through the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1541.872s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They could have had people out there with portable cameras doing the portable televising of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1546.456s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then, if in fact, and when they do come back on, that they would have a whole host of things to put on, the Memorial Day service, graduations, whatever it might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1555.763s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't see any of that around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1557.825s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then we were told there's 10 board of directors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1559.627s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I have no idea who the board of directors are, and I would hope they would come forward and let us know who these board of directors are so we could get a handle on what the makeup of the board is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1569.206s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And then, I believe one of the situations that came up, going back and reviewing Judge Jackson's report, that the city paid over $15,000 on, Melanson and Heath, the city's auditor, on one particular year, going back, I believe it was just before or after Judge Jackson, indicated there was, on a $15,000 account, $5,000 was totally unaccounted for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1587.324s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No receipts, no records, totally unaccounted for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1593.157s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now I know I see one of the folks sitting in the audience, I don't know which one it is, but I know he came to the podium one night and he said it was a combination of sloppy bookkeeping, not keeping the records accurate, but we're going to do a better job and all of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1606.01s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, our resolution last week was to ask for an audit, a complete audit on channel three for the last three years and have that forwarded to the city because the rate payers really have no other alternative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1617.708s">[Robert Penta]</a>: but to either go to the mirror.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1618.928s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it's obvious that the mirror is either failing to do anything, doesn't want to do anything, afraid to do something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1624.93s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the people's voice, which is at this podium right now, is nothing more than asking, what is really going on over there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1632.052s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, why would you want to put a TV station for cable subscribers for public access at a location that has no accessibility to the cable?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1643.836s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1644.636s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Number two, why wasn't that thought out ahead of time<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1647.216s">[Robert Penta]</a>: to know that cable access could not go there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1649.578s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And number three, more importantly, you know, they should go out and find another spot and think about what really cable access is here within this community and what it should be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1658.265s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because the taxpayers and the rate payers, as Councilor Caraviello alluded to last Tuesday night, they're getting ripped off each and every month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1664.65s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There should be an accounting for that money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1666.211s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There should be a credit coming back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1667.952s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the City of Medford should not be holding that money available for Channel 3 if they're not broadcasting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1672.984s">[Robert Penta]</a>: People are getting paid for doing no work, because there's no work to be done over there, and there's no broadcasting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1678.367s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So, with that being said, Mr. President, I think we really need to get an answer from our city solicitor as it relates to, is the city of Medford using a public building for the purposes of having transmission out of this building to 32 Riverside Avenue for the purposes of having public access cable television?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1697.556s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And if that's the case, what is, if any, legal ramifications that might be involved?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1702.605s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let's go back to the other issue, Mr. Clark, who comes into the building, who's going to handle the phone calls, who's going to have a set of keys, who's going to be responsible for the equipment, who's going to be responsible for the city's equipment, who's going to be responsible for what's in this building if somebody from Channel 3 or one of their designees comes into this building for whatever the reasons might be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1722.009s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's the sad part about not having this all in one place with the ability to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1727.66s">[Robert Penta]</a>: accessed in and out of one place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1729.661s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And to come here in City Hall now, after the fact, having whatever the tenure was in 5 High Street, whatever that lawsuit might be all about, whatever the reason why they left there, it doesn't make any sense that they would go to another place that gives them less opportunity for the purposes of broadcasting on a daily basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1747.69s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On motion to Councilor Penta, Vice President Del Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2051.672s">[Robert Penta]</a>: While you might be autonomous legally,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2054.366s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You are taking ratepayers' money for which the mayor of this community overrides your corporation, because he administers Channel 3.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2062.451s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He's the executive director, and technically, of your Channel 3.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2066.413s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But he's not taking any action for whatever the reason is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2069.615s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you feel as though it's your duty to go ahead and take action?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2073.017s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's my duty to let the taxpayer, ratepayer know that that Channel 3 is not operating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2077.64s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It should be operating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2078.941s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And there is something wrong, especially when you're bringing equipment into this building<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2082.574s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and trying to make the modular or the transmission go from here to there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2085.695s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why didn't you just go to another place that had access?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2095.757s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's nothing to be confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2096.838s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Don't play the game tonight, Frank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2098.018s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The bottom line is you're in a place that you had no right going to because there was no access, and you've taken two months worth of ratepayers' money that they're paying each and every<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2105.993s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're paying people at work that have no job to go to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2109.595s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, let me give you the history.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2111.036s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The history is this, Frank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2112.417s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Frank, Frank, the history is this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2115.719s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He hasn't earned my respect, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2117.7s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, you haven't earned mine either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2120.801s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's on Riverside Avenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2121.982s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're in a place that does not have access to cable, Verizon, or Comcast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2126.124s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're not operating, and the tax rate payers in this community are not getting their money's worth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2130.267s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's the bottom line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2131.567s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2132.688s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So why did you go there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2133.729s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Answer that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2134.749s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why did you go to a place knowing that there was no access?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2159.226s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, who are the board of directors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2160.887s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He said there was 10 of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2161.928s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Do you know the 10 of them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2162.849s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Who said there were 10?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2164.45s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. Sano, your director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2167.392s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, that's what he said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2168.272s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He told us they were 10.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2176.316s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let me give a little history.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2177.676s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Let me give a little history.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2179.197s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. Poleri, Mr. Poleri, Mr. Poleri, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2183.259s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. Poleri, how many board of directors do you have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2189.481s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, how many do you have right now, active?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2191.803s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I want to say six.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2192.844s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have six.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2193.885s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So your station manager was wrong when he said 10.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2201.17s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, that's what he said, 10.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2213.358s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, I don't want any history.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2214.619s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, we're not here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2216.16s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's not the resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2217.438s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The resolution's not about a history of TV3 to dance around the subject.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2220.52s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The subject matter is very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2222.221s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The rate payers have no one to go to, because the mayor is not doing anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2225.843s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So when they come to a council or a council law— Well, that's for you to discuss with the mayor, isn't it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2232.547s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yes, it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2235.549s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You may be autonomous in your mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2237.851s">[Robert Penta]</a>: In your mind, you might be autonomous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2239.673s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you are using ratepayers' money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2244.817s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're taking ratepayers' money that the mayor is giving to you because of the contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2249.942s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you have no access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2251.083s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's no television.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2252.123s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's no broadcasting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2253.625s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're paying for people that don't have a job to go to for two months plus more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2257.008s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Tell me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2261.209s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yeah, I'm really serious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2267.751s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, tell me why you're not broadcasting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2269.071s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Once again, you're ridiculous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2270.132s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why are you not broadcasting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2270.792s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And for you to come down there to a building to try to get in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2273.473s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why are you not broadcasting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2274.293s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Tell me why you're not broadcasting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2275.213s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have my phone number, Robert Diamond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2276.414s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Tell me why you're not broadcasting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2278.254s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I will talk one-on-one with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2279.675s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why aren't you broadcasting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2280.735s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Tell me why you're not broadcasting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2282.335s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Councilor, I'm not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2283.056s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why are you not?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2284.036s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He has to answer the question, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2292.695s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Point of information, I wanna know why you're not broadcasting it on Riverside Avenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2297.979s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Answer it, I don't want a long history, just tell me the reason why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2300.34s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All right, go ahead, go ahead with your statement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2301.901s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What's your answer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2367.035s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Point of information, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2368.735s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Point of information, Councilor Powell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2369.976s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Quick question for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2371.256s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why did you move from 5 High Street to 32 Riverside Avenue?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2379.874s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you're having issues at 5 High Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2384.777s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2385.597s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I also know that the city's Board of Health went down there too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2388.158s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yes, I do know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2389.859s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We had to move for the safety of our members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2392.32s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Just answer a simple question, Frank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2395.482s">[Robert Penta]</a>: 32 Riverside Ave does not have Verizon or Comcast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2398.603s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why did you go there knowing that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2401.104s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You went there knowing it didn't have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2473.079s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Point of information, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2475.66s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why did you bring your transmitter over here last week and have it stored here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2478.421s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Because you were going to transmit here and then from here it's going to bounce back there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2481.123s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why'd you do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2495.953s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you cannot broadcast legitimately on your own at 32 Riverside Avenue?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2500.315s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2501.795s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Forget City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2505.557s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You cannot do it, Frank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2507.118s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You just got through saying there's a feed here, which is going to allow you to broadcast them there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2512.14s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You cannot go to 32 Riverside Avenue on its own without City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2516.002s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You need City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2516.722s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's the bottom line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2530.495s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So why don't you just go someplace that had cable accessibility?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2554.466s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Councilman Iacocca, so a few years ago, five, six years ago, brought up that issue, and your people were here one night when we had a discussion on how Cable Comcast was being broadcast, and as a matter of fact, it went all the way to Haines Square, and it was a business person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2568.589s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Remember, who's the person?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2572.8s">[Robert Penta]</a>: My belief is Riverside Avenue going up to High Street is not wired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2576.904s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Was not wired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2590.278s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You mentioned High Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2591.579s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what I said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2595.48s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, you weren't specific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2596.8s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You said High Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2597.92s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2598.34s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Five High Streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2599.161s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Bottom line is you're wasting taxpayers' money, ratepayers' money by being in a place, you're not broadcasting, there's nothing going on over there, you're paying a station manager and one other person for nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2612.344s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There is nothing going on for him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2614.565s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2629.393s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Point of information, Mr. President, have you got any legal opinion from a city solicitor as it relates to the liability, if anything, and how this is all going to work?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2637.958s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Have you discussed this with the city solicitor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2639.919s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I have a meeting tomorrow with the mayor and the solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2642.701s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So in other words, you're going ahead, making an assumption over here by going into construction and spending money, but you haven't met with the city manager, I mean, the mayor and the solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2652.727s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you went ahead, ahead of time, two months ago, going in there, and now you just decide to go to the city solicitor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2661.27s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why is it inaccurate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2662.431s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You just said you're meeting tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2670.279s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the Mayor has given you his blessing to put your equipment in this building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2673.543s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is that what you're saying?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2674.224s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's essentially correct, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2676.426s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The Mayor of Medford said to you, Frank Palleri, Board of Directors at Channel 3, you can put your<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2682.645s">[Robert Penta]</a>: your equipment here and broadcast from here to that studio.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2714.261s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Point of further information, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2717.403s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You just used the word, hopefully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2720.805s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Give the same services, hopefully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2722.886s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2723.459s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The word hopefully should never have even been used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2725.82s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It should have been able to say, to provide the same services, period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2741.247s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But to get here and there, you keep saying here and there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2744.348s">[Robert Penta]</a>: City Hall is supposed to be a part of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2749.673s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2752.556s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, I just think there's a liability issue here and I think there's an issue that the city needs to address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2769.069s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Don't tell me what I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2771.671s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Grandstanding?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2772.331s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2773.532s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is what you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2775.073s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You coming up here and making a big example of what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2779.716s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The bottom line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2780.177s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So let me go ahead and give a step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2781.378s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2789.771s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Point of further information, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2792.717s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You keep saying you're in the process of building what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2795.563s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't have the ability to transmit out of there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2798.429s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What are you building?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2806.338s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you can't transmit from the internet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2815.084s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't care about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2816.325s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I care about- How do you think they transmit over- Keep your voice down, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2819.507s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I care about Channel 3 and the subscribers paying for the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2931.302s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know, if you're going to have this ability to come into this building because your equipment is here, what do you expect the city to do if you have to come in here<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2942.455s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and the building is closed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2944.517s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Do you expect to get keys to the city?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2987.134s">[Robert Penta]</a>: City Hall closes at 12.30 on a Friday, you have Monday through Friday, so if God forbid something had happened, you'd be down all weekend, whereas if you were in a location,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2996.087s">[Robert Penta]</a>: where all your equipment was there, somebody could get in, it could be serviced within an hour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3000.097s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Again, this does not make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3002.182s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Staying in a place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3003.706s">[Robert Penta]</a>: staying in a place that does not give you access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3006.348s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you have to do a habit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3012.031s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, you're being ridiculous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3014.492s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You went to 5 High Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3015.613s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You didn't have to get another place at 5 High Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3018.094s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You didn't have to get another place at Canal Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3019.975s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You didn't have to get another place at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3022.016s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is the only one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3023.017s">[Robert Penta]</a>: This is your fourth move.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3023.917s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And on the fourth move, you need another place to put your equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3028.04s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yeah, it really bothers me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3029.04s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why does that bother you, Councilor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3029.921s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It bothers me because it doesn't belong here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3031.222s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It belongs in the place that you're renting, that you're taking the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3034.004s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You took the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3034.865s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You took the money from the ratepayers of this community to have a public access channel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3046.893s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yeah, I remember it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3049.234s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3049.534s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The vote was four to three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3050.334s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You know why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3077.837s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3078.138s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He's just going to keep repeating the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3079.518s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I'm going to go to another question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3081.059s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Your station manager last week said he has a budget of $100,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3084.501s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have a separate budget that's doing all that work down there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3087.243s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How much is that budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3088.624s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What is that costing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3090.545s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3091.665s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What does that cost?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3101.69s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, no, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3102.291s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He indicated that there's two separate budgets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3104.392s">[Robert Penta]</a>: One is an operating budget, one's a- Well, we have an operating budget and a capital budget, sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3108.776s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So what's paying for that, operating or capital?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3160.43s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Last question, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3161.951s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Last week, because your station manager couldn't answer the question, so maybe you can answer it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3166.034s">[Robert Penta]</a>: When's the last time you've been audited?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3168.518s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Did you give him an opportunity to answer the question last night?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3171.019s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yes, I did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3171.319s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He said he didn't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3173.56s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, not an audit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3175.981s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You filed your report to the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3177.621s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm talking about an audit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3196.356s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're the station manager.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3197.677s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have your money managers over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3199.799s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They should know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3203.222s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're the president?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3204.063s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I am the president of the corporation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3205.024s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And how long have you been there, Frank?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3206.665s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I've been affiliated with TV3 since 1986.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3208.608s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well then, from 1987 to this particular time, you should have a pretty good idea how a station runs and what they're responsible for and what to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3217.962s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I have a lot better idea than you and some other people in this room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3220.706s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I just asked you the question then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3222.609s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The last time you think was three to four years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3225.092s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Three to four years ago, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3227.194s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's not an answer in your world?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3239.927s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you didn't adhere to Judge Jackson's report and her findings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3243.1s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Apparently you didn't follow her recommendations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3259.068s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, that's a very interesting comment to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3261.049s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The city pays $15,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3277.139s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you're saying that city solicitor Rumley, he hurled car bombs at you too?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3282.002s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is that what you're saying?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3283.803s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3284.524s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yeah, no comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3285.224s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I guess so, huh?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3286.465s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3287.405s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Councilor Caraviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3440.86s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What was that remark supposed to mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3443.561s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, it was just a little fun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3444.741s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3445.041s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What's that supposed to mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3446.081s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Lighten up, dear boy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3447.002s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, I'm not going to lighten up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3448.382s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm serious about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3449.862s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You think I'm going to go in there and take your equipment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3455.583s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What are you talking about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3456.443s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I didn't hurl any accusations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3457.243s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You would take offense to that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3458.144s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I didn't hurl any.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3458.644s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I just made comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3459.564s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I didn't hurl anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3460.544s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I didn't point the finger at anyone that was doing anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3463.044s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I asked questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3463.945s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is that right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3464.465s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yes, that's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3465.165s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is that right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3465.665s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3466.165s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, what about this missing money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3468.045s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You tell me about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3469.866s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's no money missing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3472.526s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, then, Senator Heath, read its report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3491.212s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Frank Leary was right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3492.192s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If that's the case, Frank, I would be more than happy to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3494.554s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But when your money managers say that you people keep sloppy bookkeeping records, I have to find out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3500.078s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3500.278s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Point of information, Vice President Del Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3705.333s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, with... Point of information, Councilor Penta.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3715.96s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you're telling me you cannot afford to have an annual audit on your books?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3720.864s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's right, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3741.962s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And they do more, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3742.922s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as a matter of fact, they go before the legislative body almost quarterly to explain what they do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3748.767s">[Robert Penta]</a>: the programs that they're presenting, and they tell them about their income levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3769.151s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have, and he hasn't responded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3770.551s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's why we're discussing it right here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3779.774s">[Robert Penta]</a>: He's not the only proper authority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3781.294s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We represent the people of this community, and we represent cable TV subscribers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3786.237s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, if you folks want to come here and give your sales pitch, you go right ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3789.879s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They can hear you, and they can hear any one of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3813.746s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Where am I getting my information?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3816.948s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Wait a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3817.889s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, you just made a comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3819.55s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yes, I did, Mr. Penta.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3820.43s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Who am I getting and where am I getting my information from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3822.972s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't think I have the ability to do this on my own?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3824.633s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is that what you're trying to say?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3826.57s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You think I'm somebody else's mouthpiece?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3833.863s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I'm not going to stand here and listen to that nonsense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3836.006s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3918.209s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All right, Councilor Panta.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3919.07s">[Robert Penta]</a>: One last question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3920.13s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You may have won the award, but so didn't 10 other communities win the award, all right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3923.851s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So you weren't the only community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3925.252s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We won the National Excellence Award.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4112.193s">[Robert Penta]</a>: On that motion, Councilor Penta.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4114.574s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If I understand how the motion just did not pass, I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4119.757s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So the question then becomes of the mayor, that the mayor should be reporting back to the council that he is allowing Channel 3, he should update this council, that he is now allowing Channel 3 to house and use this building for the purposes of supplementing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4212.754s">[Robert Penta]</a>: First Councilor Penta.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4213.875s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. President, I'm thankful that Councilor Lingo-Curran now has added on to the resolution in thought and in practice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4221.44s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What we have here is a whole host of issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4224.005s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As we had our discussion tonight relative to the pool issue, the bottom line to all of this is the mayor says everything is a priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4231.849s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Well, everything cannot be a priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4233.75s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Taxpayers in this community are going to wind up paying for everything that's a priority in the mayor's mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4238.532s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have a police yard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4239.552s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have a fire department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4240.993s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have public works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4242.374s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have whatever the heck is going on on Commercial Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4245.235s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know how much longer that's going to last.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4249.237s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We still haven't even resolved the issue<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4251.573s">[Robert Penta]</a>: of the girls or the ladies or the women, however you want to use the terminology in the police department, you know, the locker rooms or the lack of locker rooms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4259.505s">[Robert Penta]</a>: and the safety issues that need to be revolved over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4263.868s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We never even got to the point of the Water and Sewer Department after the fire in May of three years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4268.872s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They were supposed to get a trailer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4270.013s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They never even got a trailer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4272.334s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, these things go on and on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4274.336s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I mean, we have a swimming pool that's now going to get us well up to almost $3,800,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4277.418s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It started off as a $2.3 million adventure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4279.119s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So I just don't think the taxpayers of this city<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4286.238s">[Robert Penta]</a>: should be led to believe, oh, we can afford it, we can afford it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4289.079s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What can we afford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4289.9s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Every time you slap a dollar on the price tag of all of this stuff, somebody has to pay for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4295.943s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Now, there's no conversation anymore about the no-interest loans that the MWRA had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4300.625s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know whatever happened to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4301.966s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We never heard anything more about, you know, the money that was supposed to be coming forward from the billboards and all of that to appropriate this money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4309.73s">[Robert Penta]</a>: So, I really think, Mr. President, before any votes take place,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4315.07s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Any agreements take place on any one of these issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4317.973s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We really need to, if the mayor doesn't want to put it in some kind of an order of priority, then maybe the council should, between and amongst ourselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4325.899s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maybe we all feel that the public works department is more important than the pool, or maybe the police department is more important than the pool, or the pool is more important than the fire department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4334.727s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4335.467s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But there's only so much money that we have to go out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4337.91s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And you have a budget coming up right around the corner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4340.231s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as Councilor Lungelkorn alluded to before,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4342.515s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And as Councilor Marks also alluded to, we should have these figures before this budget even comes into place so we have some kind of an idea how much this is gonna cost and where we're going with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4356.882s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You talk to the rate payer, the taxpayer on the street, all they know is the cost of everything just keeps going up and up and up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4363.726s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And the cost of government keeps going up too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4366.327s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think we saw a pure example of it tonight<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4368.686s">[Robert Penta]</a>: on Channel 3 coming down here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4370.167s">[Robert Penta]</a>: To me, it's total incompetence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4371.928s">[Robert Penta]</a>: They did not want to address or discuss the issue regarding ratepayers' money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4376.111s">[Robert Penta]</a>: At least we can discuss taxpayers' money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4379.073s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And at least we have some semblance of controlling of what's going on in this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4383.597s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Unfortunately, on the cable TV subscribers, why the mayor is refusing to get involved to do anything, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4390.882s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Maybe they have a tie over him over something, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4393.624s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But it's absolutely wrong as to what's going on over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4396.286s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But more importantly, at least on this particular issue,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4398.683s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We have some control over it, and we have the control of either saying yes, no, or maybe, or cut it in between, and maybe it's not as grandiose as it appears to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4407.668s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4408.548s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Councilor Longo-Kurin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4891.449s">[Robert Penta]</a>: At the meeting tonight, there were two papers that were handled of updates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4894.93s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I think you got one of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4897.071s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Oh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4897.391s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4897.751s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And I think all the council should get copies of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4909.658s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And there was another two-page one that they had given out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7773.444s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Joseph Pierre.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7779.729s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is that your brother?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7780.87s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Joseph O. No, he's Joseph O. Joseph O. Pierre.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7784.573s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I get a page here from the Sailor of Weights and Measures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7787.535s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It's unsigned and undated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7790.217s">[Robert Penta]</a>: As a matter of fact, both of his pages are unsigned and undated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7798.664s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Mr. Clark, they're unsigned and undated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7831.107s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You're using Friday Canal Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7833.248s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What's Harvard Street?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7839.513s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What's your company?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7850.86s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have two different names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7857.179s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have two different corporations?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7865.245s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All County Transportation, Inc.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7872.09s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You have one cab already right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7874.232s">[Robert Penta]</a>: What's the name of that cab company?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7884.711s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't understand this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7885.532s">[Robert Penta]</a>: If you want three cabs, why do you have two different cab company names?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7909.553s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How could you be paying $600 a month if you didn't get the license?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7915.807s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The insurance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7916.507s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7917.348s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Insurance for what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7921.79s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You paid $7,200 a year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7923.23s">[Robert Penta]</a>: $7,200 a year, that's what you pay for insurance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7926.112s">[Robert Penta]</a>: But you don't have a cab license.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7927.632s">[Robert Penta]</a>: How could you be paying that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7971.937s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You are self-insured $10,000 for each car.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7974.438s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's what you're saying?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7975.698s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yes, most of the cabins are self-insured.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7977.819s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You put $20,000 up to insure two cars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7982.541s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You just got through saying you're paying $600 a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7984.202s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7984.322s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Current insurance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8034.442s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Is your other taxi self-insured too?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8100.859s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't possibly can believe that you need two more cabs to operate in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8108.503s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You already have one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8109.223s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That's 44 cabs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8111.504s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I just cannot believe there is no<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8115.354s">[Robert Penta]</a>: There's no business out there for 44 cabs in this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8119.617s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I just don't understand this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8125.701s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8129.844s">[Robert Penta]</a>: I don't know if you're from a court or what, but I can't support it because I just think this is completely out of control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8135.023s">[Robert Penta]</a>: All of it's out of control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8136.524s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You don't even have your own certificate of insurance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8138.845s">[Robert Penta]</a>: You write self-insured.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8140.246s">[Robert Penta]</a>: The Commonwealth of Massachusetts tells you you have to have a stamped self-insured certificate when you're using the term self-insured.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8247.443s">[Robert Penta]</a>: That Mr. Ramirez be invited down, who was a wonderful asset,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8250.635s">[Robert Penta]</a>: at the Brookline Bank and he just retired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8253.516s">[Robert Penta]</a>: And it'd be nice to have the people take a look and see and have him give us his resume.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8296.098s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Two papers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8296.598s">[Robert Penta]</a>: 13-449.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8298.786s">[Robert Penta]</a>: It was laid in the table on the 14th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8301.868s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Um, DPW parks department and Hormel commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8305.79s">[Robert Penta]</a>: We get a report back on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8309.151s">[Robert Penta]</a>: No, but he laid it for one week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8314.134s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8361.026s">[Robert Penta]</a>: Why can't it be open all the time?<br><br>
