<h2><a href="../2025-10-30_sQqMa0Ysceo/2025-10-30_sQqMa0Ysceo.html">Medford Happenings Episode 29 Michael Marks and Robert Penta</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=127.888s">Well,</a> the first thing that I've seen over the past four years, especially with this particular council, is how they treat the people when they come to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=138.91s">And</a> it's not very nice at times. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=141.237s">and</a> I've been a product of what they've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=145.559s">They're</a> not courteous. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=146.939s">They're</a> not willing to listen. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=148.94s">They</a> have an agenda sometimes, many times, has nothing to do with the city of Medford, and when you try to correct them on that, they don't want to listen to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=156.723s">Also,</a> the fact that they cut down the speaking times at the podium, another act that just doesn't speak well for good government, because good government <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=166.717s">as</a> an elected official, you're supposed to just sit there, listen to what people have to say, and then get involved in your conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=174.422s">And</a> that's, can I just detour one thing real quick, because it has something to do with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=180.185s">It</a> has everything to do with what we just went through now, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=183.603s">to</a> get onto your program, John. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=185.745s">Because</a> when I was in the city council, we spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to make a class aid studio up in Method High School, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=194.571s">And</a> to unfortunately have to do this late at night, not use that studio, that's there for the people for public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=201.076s">That's</a> what it was there for. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=202.958s">And</a> the city administration uncomfortably has made this very hard for people like you, who does a wonderful job in bringing both sides in, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=211.244s">not</a> to be up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=213.325s">I'm</a> just upset, to be honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=215.526s">That's</a> why we're not at the studio, okay?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=340.767s">As</a> an addition to that, John, hopefully, if a majority of these new independent candidates get elected, one of the <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=350.018s">The</a> first few things that they do is they bring back the weekly meetings, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=354.023s">And</a> number two, they bring back the five-minute rule to let people speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=357.467s">And</a> if it means speaking more than once, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=360.13s">Listen,</a> some of the issues that are going on right now in this city demands an awful lot of the people's input, because that, unfortunately, is what's causing this election to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=370.061s">They're</a> not being heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=371.462s">And</a> you have this group of people that are on the council right now that only think one way. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=376.483s">They</a> will not open up their brain to listen to an opposing opinion.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=693.497s">I</a> do. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=694.858s">The</a> fact of the matter is this whole issue had its initial beginning a couple of years ago on the Salem Street area. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=701.602s">A</a> lady by the name of Shoah Rodriguez, a great warrior for the neighborhood, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=706.184s">was</a> out there and they came to they eventually came to an agreement between the neighbors and as to what was being proposed in the city and the city council this city council wanted to go against it and they did and that suddenly it was a pushback okay but what they're proposing they were proposing to put you into a 4,000 square foot lot <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=726.643s">and</a> they're allowing you, if this goes through anywhere, some one to three additional units. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=731.588s">They're</a> also taking the 75-year-old homes that are in a particular district, and you'll be able to put two to three more in-house people in those 75-year-old homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=743.578s">The</a> setbacks from the street in the back, they're changing all of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=750.143s">Wrapping</a> up what Michael is saying, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=752.563s">If</a> even if a developer were to come in and this was going to take place, doesn't people realize that developers buying the property, so he's going to be paying a lot of money, then he's going to have to pay to develop the piece of property. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=764.875s">So</a> if you think you're going to sell that to a low or moderate income person, no, because he's going to want to get his money back. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=770.14s">That's</a> for sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=771.2s">And</a> then add on to that, if it has an effect on the school system, for which it will, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=776.185s">all</a> these people coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=777.306s">Somebody's</a> going to have kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=778.628s">And</a> right now the school system is at max of these elementary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=782.371s">What</a> are we doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=783.432s">So</a> the planning here is absolutely ridiculous, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=787.116s">And</a> once the mayor got a hold of it, I believe it was in August of this year, she sent a letter to the council and to the planning board to let's just push back <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=797.225s">She</a> didn't realize, I believe she said she didn't realize that the pushback was so strong on the neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=802.589s">And</a> as a result of that, you know, it hasn't gone anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=805.951s">But</a> the sad part is this, John, this is the sad part. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=809.534s">You've</a> got seven independent candidates that are running and hopefully they get in there, at least the majority. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=815.678s">Because</a> if they don't get in there, the unfortunate part is if four out of the seven get in there of the present city council, which are OR revolutionary, they're just going to go forward with this change in zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=827.849s">And</a> this is going to really send the city into a tailspin. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=831.412s">You</a> won't recognize Medford after this.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=973.305s">John,</a> one step further to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=975.167s">One</a> step further to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=976.548s">If</a> this were to go through, you could get a hodgepodge on the same street. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=982.753s">One</a> side of the street will be zoned one way. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=984.674s">It</a> depends on how the development is going to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=990.539s">This</a> doesn't belong in Method right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=994.022s">They've</a> got 1,000 new units coming on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=998.275s">And</a> if the city was so concerned about affordable and low-income housing, they should be going out there and look at pieces of property. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1005.037s">A</a> classic piece for them to take would be the carbons on Salem Street, because they're getting that from nothing from the MBTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1012.6s">And</a> make sure that the MBTA cleans the land first, OK? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1016.141s">Yeah,</a> you know, we could go on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1018.202s">Like</a> Michael says, we could go on. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1019.643s">There</a> are so many nuances, so many nuances to this here. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1023.286s">You</a> know, like I said, right now you're allowed to put an additional 900 square feet unit on your house. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1029.61s">But</a> if you can go, the state allows you, you can go back to the city, get a special permit from the city and you could put two on on your present existing. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1038.877s">So</a> this is you've got to read what they're proposing. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1041.719s">It's</a> crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1042.399s">It's</a> absolutely.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1320.885s">Not</a> for anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1321.906s">This</a> is where Michael and I part ways because, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1327.201s">seriously,</a> because I know a lot of work went into this, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1331.002s">And</a> having served for many years in this council, I was never even asked for my opinion by the group of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1336.463s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1337.523s">Number</a> two, Michael's for what councils? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1340.764s">I'm</a> not for what councils. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1341.904s">I</a> don't see any need to increase the annual budget by a minimum of $120,000 to add four more councils on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1349.626s">And</a> then at the same time, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1351.275s">make</a> the financial corrections in the council chamber to put the people in there.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1398.962s">Well,</a> let's put it this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1400.343s">Whether</a> it's $30,000 or $17,000, you're still going to be increasing the budget of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1405.526s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1406.147s">Number</a> two, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1407.067s">They</a> have a thing here on page eight of this new document, which is 54 pages long, that the city Councilors can submit expenses and their costs for being a Councilor during the course of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1419.893s">So</a> let me remind everybody, including you, Michael, we were on the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1424.082s">The</a> IRS came in and said you could not do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1426.724s">So</a> whatever you were going to be getting for your expenses would have to just go into your salary and that's how it was corrected. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1434.27s">But</a> this is included in this particular budget, excuse me, in this particular piece of legislation. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1440.235s">The</a> mayor is serving for 16 years, but there's no term limits for the city council or the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1446.119s">And</a> that's not right either. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1448.468s">The</a> idea that the school committee would have two wards put together, why they couldn't agree to come to 11, I don't know, but two wards put together because in one of the two wards, there'll be a school. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1459.995s">So</a> at least there'll be a school for every two wards. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1462.777s">That</a> doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1465.079s">What</a> happens if another ward and the future years decide they want to have a school? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1469.201s">Are</a> they going to need a school because of the increase in the population? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1472.744s">They</a> should have just left the school committee alone <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1475.308s">seven</a> members at large, and then they decided to take the mayor off the school committee as to being the chairperson, because now she is nothing more than a member. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1485.46s">So</a> think of this logically. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1487.142s">If</a> she sits on that school committee as a member, but he or she in the future is also a mayor, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1493.69s">That's</a> the money person in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1495.312s">Do</a> you think you're going to put a non-money person that's going to sit in the chair that's going to be arguing with the man who's going to be sitting on the floor? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1502.5s">I</a> don't think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1503.741s">Plus</a> the fact, John, this has always been my belief. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1506.784s">When</a> I ran for office, I knew what my duty was. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1510.508s">I</a> had to go out there and campaign. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1512.65s">And</a> I lost 36 pounds my very first time out there, ringing the doorbells and having people meet me, passing out my literature and going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1521.152s">I'm</a> a firm believer, if you really want something that bad, then go for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1525.474s">Because</a> that's how the city of Medford has gone on for so many years, since 1939. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1529.555s">They've</a> had seven councils at large. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1533.156s">So</a> by just increasing them, the next argument would be, let's just say I'm coming from Ward 8. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1539.583s">and</a> watch two, three, and four don't like me, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1542.884s">For</a> whatever the reason is, they don't like me, my style, whatever I'm proposing, I'm not gonna get anywhere with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1548.866s">But</a> if I was at large, it affects the entire community. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1552.567s">And</a> you could see that through the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1554.228s">And</a> I'll tell you another thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1555.679s">The</a> camaraderie that existed with seven Councilors in the past, even when Michael was there, at least we got along. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1561.081s">We</a> have differences of opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1562.302s">This</a> is just going to open up a ball of wax that somebody in Ward 8 needs something that's more important, and they're going to consider it more important than another ward in this and that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1571.145s">And</a> then you're going to get into this political hangover. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1573.246s">It's</a> just, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1575.687s">But</a> no term limits for Councilors, no term limits for school committee, but the mayor gets 14 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1580.949s">I</a> don't know where that comes from or where the logic to that came from.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1605.301s">And</a> you just gotta balance it out, but it is a living- But one important thing, this is a document that got passed by the legislature and signed by the governor, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1615.427s">I've</a> got it right here, 50 some odd pages. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1618.088s">The</a> taxpayers of this community should have gotten a copy of this document, be made available to them so they can read it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1626.011s">They're</a> not in the city clerk's office and they think you're talking Chinese to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1629.872s">Can</a> we get a copy of it? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1631.152s">The</a> registrar voters should have a copy for anyone that would want it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1635.774s">Not</a> everybody has a computer to go on and read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1638.614s">If</a> it's such a good document and if the city thought it was such a, what would it be to spend a few thousand dollars and mail it out to every registered voter?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1659.64s">That's</a> why he's on the other side of you right now.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1719.174s">What's</a> the answer? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1721.155s">First</a> of all, John, last year, when that override for $456 a year and keep going forward, the only way that's ever gonna come off is the council is gonna have to vote it out or put it on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1731.497s">Plus</a> the fact, plus the fact, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1735.027s">that</a> 456 has got nothing to do with the tax rate that's going to be set. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1739.309s">So</a> that's going to be 456 over and beyond. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1743.331s">But</a> the fact of the matter is, you keep talking about, you'll tell me why there is a need for a new high school, because number one, if the school had been maintained like it should have been, you know, we went through this with all the elementary schools after so many years, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1757.45s">You</a> know, they didn't take care of the schools and they're in almost the same condition right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1761.652s">But</a> that's not the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1762.572s">They</a> put a new science lab in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1764.212s">They</a> did a new section over there where the pool is and stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1767.674s">The</a> infrastructure of our city is in desperate need of help. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1771.675s">The</a> high school is not falling apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1774.216s">You</a> have to have a sense of priority of where you're going to go in the city and how you're going to spend your money. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1779.458s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1780.531s">So</a> therefore, I would hope that this new council, when they come in, they look at that override and just saying, hey, when that override was passed on, it was $28 million in city monies and free cash sitting there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1793.605s">And</a> the override was only for $7.5 million worth of what was needed at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1798.571s">So</a> they could have deducted that from the $28 million, but they didn't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1802.535s">And</a> the unfortunate part is the at present city council doesn't think like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1806.918s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1807.618s">They</a> have more on these national issues and more on these social issues and whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1813.102s">They</a> don't know how to think about Medford and where it's going and how to spend the dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1817.805s">And</a> that's the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1818.845s">And</a> that's why you're seeing, you're seeing seven new Councilors running this year, you know, to get back and take a grip back of our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1826.35s">And</a> we've got to do it because you just go up to keep, who do you think is going to keep paying for all these things? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1831.693s">It's</a> the taxpayer, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1833.255s">There's</a> no doubt about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1834.537s">And</a> that's just it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1836.079s">Common</a> sense, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1837.521s">Common</a> sense when you're going to spend the taxpayer's dollars.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1992.829s">I</a> want to jump in there because he brings up a good point, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=1997.85s">The</a> fact of the matter is every year the state auditor was supposed to have an audit of the expenditures of the new schools going forward until they were paid off, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2010.521s">And</a> while that was supposed to be five percent of the budget of each school, five percent of the budget of each school, it never took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2018.167s">And</a> because it never took place, those schools just fell into disrepair. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2022.571s">You</a> could go into the Brooks School and you'll find, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2026.21s">I</a> don't want to name any schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2027.511s">I</a> mentioned that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2029.173s">I</a> hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2029.893s">But</a> the fact of the matter is this, John, OK? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2032.495s">It's</a> your elected people. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2034.697s">And</a> if they were doing their job, they would have realized that that money should have gone in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2039.08s">There</a> should be no reason to be spending hundreds and millions of dollars to refurbish new schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2043.884s">It</a> doesn't make any sense.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2045.886s">So</a> before you get to that, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2048.055s">Drive</a> down the streets, look at your potholes, look at your sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2051.917s">And</a> if you want to talk about something crazy, talk about the crazy bump outs all over the city, OK? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2057.76s">You</a> tell me what that's going to serve.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2111.851s">Some</a> of it has no rhyme or reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2115.132s">There</a> again, you say a lot of things need to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2117.673s">You</a> can go back to maybe a year and a half ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2119.734s">This</a> all starts in West Method, coming from Winchester, not being able to take a right down Plaisted Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2125.977s">They</a> put those stupid cones there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2127.837s">And</a> as of last, a few months ago, what did they do? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2131.659s">By</a> Osborne Road, they shut the street off. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2133.9s">For</a> what reason? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2134.94s">okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2135.501s">And</a> then you have Councilor Lazzaro, Emily Lazzaro, trying to take credit, trying to trade credit for the Salem Street Rotary. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2142.368s">If</a> you look at that, the first snowstorm, that traffic is going to be backed up into 93. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2146.312s">It</a> doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2148.894s">You</a> go on Main Street by Stanley Road or Stanley Street, they're all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2155.021s">Compare</a> that to a legitimate <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2157.973s">street</a> that needs to be, Riverside Ave, where Councilor Marks lives, that really needs to be rehabilitated. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2163.978s">High</a> Street, going from the Winter Street Rotary up there, you wonder what the hell is going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2169.903s">Who's</a> running the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2171.264s">And</a> you know another stupid thing, John? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2172.986s">If</a> you drive on Mystic Ave, okay, next to the Great Beer Garden, you go a little bit further down, they have a bike lane in the middle of a highway, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2182.854s">It</a> doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2185.675s">Whoever's</a> running these things, department heads, you could go to, we won't get into it, but go ahead.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2219.029s">I</a> appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2220.27s">And</a> where were the Councilors? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2221.29s">Not</a> one Councilor speaking up, at least no matter how. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2224.273s">That's</a> why you need a new direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2230.137s">The</a> direction should be Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2231.958s">Let's</a> do a Medford direction.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2427.315s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2427.655s">If</a> you want to just jump in real quick, when he talks about the Greek school, there's an island down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2432.437s">If</a> you go down High Street on the island, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2434.259s">And</a> then the wintertime, that sign that's in the middle gets knocked down two or three times by cars and trucks because they put the island in there, but they don't paint the cement, the borders in orange. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2447.844s">They</a> just leave it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2449.104s">I</a> mean, you can just drive into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2451.785s">Simple</a> little things like safety, you know, I mean, paint, what's a little orange paint, a yellow iridescent paint, something, you know, it's just... One driver, one bike, people riding bikes too, it's the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2464.853s">You</a> know, you talk about riding bikes. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2466.674s">If</a> the police department really wanted to make some money, they could do it with these bikes. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2470.676s">These</a> bikes should be registered and insured. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2472.818s">These</a> guys driving down the street and girls going to red lights, cutting people off and then giving you the finger after they do it, please, please.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2524.73s">John,</a> this all reflects back on the council that is there right now, back to the days when Michael was there and I was serving. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2532.975s">I</a> mean, you would get a few things done in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2536.577s">You</a> cannot, the last four years, you could not go before this council, express your opinion, especially if it was contrary to theirs. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2544.021s">And</a> when they cut everybody from five minutes down to three, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2547.018s">Yeah,</a> that's it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2789.072s">You</a> also have your first responders in there, you know, and yeah, they do the first respond, they do just not a lot because he basically hit it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2797.835s">Firstly,</a> me if I were back in City Hall, my concern would be the contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2802.717s">There's</a> no reason to have contracts go over and beyond <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2807.663s">their</a> due dates of when they should be renewed by. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2810.265s">You</a> negotiate a contract for four years, whatever it is, once it's done, you should just go right into it, not wait until maybe six months before. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2820.812s">And</a> then when you go to these contracts and you go to these meetings and you hear both the fire and the police say, someone doesn't show up and that just pushes it back and pushes it back and for whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2832.181s">I</a> think there needs to be a new direction that's looked at <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2835.543s">personally</a> with the council and the fire and the police and anything that does with public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2841.346s">Because</a> that's the mainstay. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2843.827s">If</a> you don't have a safe city, what do you have? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2846.748s">You</a> have nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2847.789s">You</a> can say anything you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2851.01s">DPW,</a> do they have enough people? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2853.211s">Who</a> knows? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2853.912s">It</a> seems like they have enough equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2856.093s">But</a> if you look at the issues, the guys who turn around and say that they're being told to go here, there, and everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2862.088s">You</a> know something, John, I'm just going to go back. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2864.49s">Sometimes</a> I repeat myself and I apologize, but I don't apologize because I don't like to repeat myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2870.193s">I</a> don't like to say the same thing over and over. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2872.875s">And</a> if this administration, and I don't know how they're running it, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2877.835s">would</a> take more of an active position with the council and start to share what the needs are and what the concerns are and what the finances might be or has to be or what it should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2889.526s">And</a> yes, that's one of the things they do address in the new charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2892.528s">That's</a> OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2893.229s">I'm</a> glad they put it in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2896.023s">It's</a> not going to get corrected unless there's a meeting of the minds. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2900.044s">Why</a> should we, sometimes when you are there, have somebody come in and they start talking about, you know, their concerns for the city, you know, and they'll turn around and say, well, we don't want to say anything in this and that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2912.227s">But</a> it bothers them, you know, and that's just it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2916.948s">It's</a> the whole idea of having communication and common sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2920.709s">If</a> we can afford it, we can afford it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2922.531s">The</a> best example, am I going to spend almost $300 million for high school? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2926.454s">Or</a> am I going to look at these streets and these sidewalks and the public safety that's really needed? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2931.197s">And</a> the concern of the public safety of the elementary schools that are there right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2935.601s">It's</a> a shame that they're spending millions of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2938.483s">Rick</a> Caraviello, when he first ran, I'll never forget in his first term, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2943.651s">And</a> he made the comment that the schools, and that's when he got elected some 12 years ago, the schools were at a million dollar a year repair rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2952.177s">And</a> now it's even more than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2954.159s">That</a> absolutely should have never, never happened in a million years. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2957.901s">That's</a> management. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=2959.042s">That's</a> poor management.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3037.909s">Do</a> you know something, John? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3039.45s">You</a> say there's a lot of good in the city and there is. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3041.832s">There's</a> much more good. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3043.253s">There</a> are many more good people than there are <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3045.381s">But</a> the unfortunate part is when you serve in politics, what you basically see most of the time is what needs to be corrected. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3052.684s">It</a> would be great to go to a council meeting and just every, oh, wasn't this great? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3056.865s">Mary's</a> kid got a scholarship. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3058.566s">It</a> would be great to do that, but it's not happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3061.147s">And</a> that would be abdicating your responsibility because you're supposed to be looking out for the city as a whole, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3066.969s">And</a> I don't care whether you're a ward council or a council at large, no matter what you vote for, it's going to affect the city as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3073.951s">And</a> that's how I looked at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3075.192s">That's</a> how I looked at it, and I still look at it that way.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3226.554s">John,</a> you know what y'all like? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3228.295s">Y'all</a> like Medford's Joe Rogan, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3231.278s">You</a> are his podcast, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3233.519s">Because</a> that you are, your group of folks are the only ones that have done anything, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3239.684s">You</a> know, listen, you know, Michael forgot one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3243.887s">He</a> mentioned the six people <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3246.218s">you</a> know, the six people, the names there that are running. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3249.319s">They</a> seem to forget that the people that they're running against have thousands of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3254.022s">They</a> have thousands of dollars coming in from all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3258.023s">That's</a> why the people of Medford, if you're really serious about wanting to save your city and elect people that are independent, okay, you've got to get out and vote and vote for these seven people, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3268.808s">The</a> shame to the whole thing is <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3272.109s">These</a> folks, they don't own businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3273.99s">They</a> have no idea what it means to pay a more, I mean, not a more, I mean, to pay the rent, to pay taxes, to pay insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3283.052s">It</a> just doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3284.733s">But</a> I'm going to go back to what I originally said. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3286.553s">It's</a> this. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3287.574s">When</a> somebody comes to the podium and they're mistreated rudely, OK? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3292.295s">And</a> as Michael earlier said, sometimes they're even condescended. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3295.396s">And</a> I, being a former member of this board for many, many years, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3299.491s">And</a> at times, not only were they disrespected, wasn't even allowed to speak, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3305.756s">That's</a> what's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3306.917s">That's</a> what's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3307.937s">That's</a> why they should all go.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3355.606s">And</a> John, the bigger part of that, the bigger part of that disgrace, what Michael was talking about, how they made a last minute deal that nobody even knows what the deal was, which changed the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3366.05s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3384.074s">Well,</a> you're not even in the studio. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3385.575s">Where</a> are you?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3390.258s">There's</a> still things we have to do, so... I'm not trying to give you a hard time, but I'm a firm believer in that studio issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3398.464s">We</a> spent many hours and hundreds of thousands of dollars for that studio not to be open at nighttime and do things like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3405.849s">That's</a> what it's all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3407.21s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3407.97s">Yeah,</a> it's not a nine-to-five job.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sQqMa0Ysceo&t=3436.556s">Well,</a> let me ask you, the next time I come on, will I get a blue background?<h2><a href="../2024-06-01_TWmAoWQ2xQE/2024-06-01_TWmAoWQ2xQE.html">City Council 04-30-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4059.531s">My</a> name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4062.853s">Having</a> served on this board some years ago, the city of Medford and Tufts University engaged in the pilot, a million dollar pilot program. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4070.599s">And</a> the pilot program consisted of six students from Medford, six students from Somerville, who'd be able to go to Tufts University for nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4078.644s">The</a> million dollar cash part of the program consisted of three years of getting cash up front with the remaining portions of the money to be used for <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4087.17s">I</a> think there could have been fire or police equipment here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4091.334s">Now</a> that hasn't been followed through since, for what reason, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4096.54s">But</a> the idea of taxing up to 25% relative to the nonprofit, whether it's Tufts University or someone else, I guess you haven't hit the dollar mark yet of where you're gonna go. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4107.008s">But</a> speaking with leaders up at the State House, the one thing that the City of Medford hasn't done, as other cities and towns done, you have not moved to provide an amendment to the CPA tax, which would include affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4120.793s">And</a> as a result of that, and knowing that the Commonwealth now does not give back to the City of Medford from their surplus to the CPA, it's all going to be on cities and towns, excuse me, individually. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4134.938s">So</a> I think the city of mid that has an opening over and beyond your 25% also to amend the CPA to now include affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4144.467s">You</a> know, you give it to churches, you've given it to schools into swimming pools and open space and land. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4150.333s">This</a> is a great opportunity right now for you as a council, first term especially, to move forward on your reps and on your senators to make this amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4159.44s">You're</a> not getting rid of the CPA, you're amending it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4162.442s">And</a> by amending it to put this inclusion in there, this will be your first step along with your 25% for the purpose of going forward to get your affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4171.489s">The</a> other part of affordable housing is very simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4175.672s">What</a> has the city of Medford, can you folks, any one of you here, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4180.322s">give</a> an accounting of how much money has been used for affordable housing, where has the location's been, where is the land, and where has the working relationship taken place between a private contractor coming in with the city of Medford to provide affordable housing along with regular housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4200.675s">I</a> don't think you have a big inventory on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4202.617s">And</a> I think if you keep talking about affordable housing, you keep talking about the transfer tax, you keep talking about the registry, I think you should start there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4211.023s">Because</a> if there's nothing on the books right now, I think you need to get your feet wet in that particular area, get your base set up before you go into this next move. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4220.251s">25%</a> sounds good. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4221.072s">I</a> think you need an inventory of all the property in the city method that's tax exempt. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4225.035s">And</a> I'm quite sure you'll find <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4226.696s">There</a> are other pieces only on Tufts University where you can get that 25% from. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4231.419s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4275.327s">But</a> a few years ago up in Beacon Hill, before the 25% came into play, there was a percentage ratio that went, like I believe Tufts University at the time had a $30 million endowment. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4285.695s">And</a> there was a dollar amount that was set on the endowment that the school had. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4289.878s">as</a> to what percentage it would go. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4291.841s">Now,</a> Tufts doesn't have a large endowment. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4293.663s">It's</a> not like Harvard University that's into the billions of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4297.368s">But</a> there was a dollar amount, you may want to check this out once again, do your homework, go to Beacon Hill and find out what that legislation was. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4304.438s">Unfortunately,</a> it didn't pass because as you said before, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4308.402s">Academy</a> of colleges and universities. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4310.565s">But</a> still, it's a stepping stone to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4313.369s">You</a> know, and these are all pilot programs that you can look into, just because somebody is multi rich, like having I mean, Tufts University, you might find other locations where, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4326.28s">Listen,</a> if you treat one one way, you got to treat them all the same way. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4330.762s">And</a> it might be better to have a universal thing rather than go to the 25% and just go for the biggest one. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4335.604s">Because</a> if you can work on all of them, maybe in the long run, you'll be able to get more in the long run than just grappling at the first one.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4367.516s">But</a> what you don't have right now in your inventory, you might have that, which I can vote, but you don't have the physical ground locations with new and additional affordable housing can go in and working toward that with getting this money, whether it's again, the 25% of the affordable housing of the CPA money, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4386.75s">Understood.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4387.171s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4387.811s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8558.968s">Mr.</a> President, can I speak on that first? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8561.349s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8585.106s">Did</a> you withdraw it?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8875.732s">Mr.</a> Chairman.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9158.611s">Robert</a> Pinto, Zero Summit Road in Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9162.154s">Regarding</a> the public letter that was written on April 16th regarding House Bill, I believe it's 3128, the Affordable Home Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9174.103s">In</a> that particular bill, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9176.141s">There</a> were transfers fees also that could be beneficial to a community that were discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9182.47s">And</a> there was seven inclusions as it related what you could and could not do, which also had an opt-in and an opt-out proviso in that bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9192.364s">But</a> I'd like to, to you, Mr. Chairman, I want to get to your letter of April 28, where you sent out a notice saying, correcting the record on Medved's plans to address the housing crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9204.072s">And</a> two particular paragraphs were sort of like, watch me. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9207.054s">The</a> first, the first one states the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9209.736s">The</a> City Council and the City Planning staff are working on zoning rebuild reforms to allow more housing to be built, reduce permitting and regulatory burdens for private property owners, encouraging major economic development, and require construction of more <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9227.916s">subsidize</a> affordable housing units. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9230.358s">We</a> are also working on policies to benefit good landlords like the Good Landlord Tax Credit. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9237.422s">And</a> the second paragraph reads, the final piece of that comprehensive approach <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9243.405s">is</a> anti-disbursement policies targeted at the large corporations who are buying properties, jacking up rents, and earning a huge profit by knocking out long-time residents and making unnaturally affordable units too expensive for the average person. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9262.242s">I</a> understand what you wrote, but I don't understand who these large corporations that are coming in here into the city of Medford and they're dispersing people. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9271.87s">I</a> see houses that are bought by individuals who had an opportunity to buy a single family or two family house as an individual, but not as a corporation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9281.379s">And</a> you sent this out apparently because you wanted to allegedly, you know, correct something that was sent out. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9289.502s">But</a> if I were to see this as I did see it, I'm confused right now because I don't know of any major large corporations that have come in to the city of Medford and bought single or two family homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9302.369s">either</a> tore them down, rebuilt them, and sold them for large profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9306.431s">I</a> know individual people have done it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9308.653s">But</a> when you say large corporations, it makes it look like this city is now being overrun by large corporations. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9315.516s">And</a> if you're going to address that through your zoning and your community development, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9322.278s">The</a> wording is very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9324.6s">And</a> this type of wording makes it look like corporate America has just taken over the city of Medford, making it unaffordable for people to live here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9332.525s">And</a> that's not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9333.966s">You</a> also have the opportunity of a business person or a business lady who may be able to come in here, can afford to buy a single or two or a three family house, do it over, and if they can make a profit, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9345.773s">If</a> the city really wants to get into affordable housing and low and moderate income housing, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9351.457s">They've</a> had the last eight years to talk about this and do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9355.978s">And</a> if they're not going to do it, then maybe it should be on the burden of the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9360.359s">And</a> maybe you just you guys and girls, you just voted tonight on a CPA to give more money out, maybe to a place in the Brooks Estates. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9368.881s">But</a> put that aside. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9370.241s">If</a> you're really concerned and really serious about affordable housing, you should start putting all your pennies together on all your nickels and all your dimes and all your resources where the money can come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9380.063s">and</a> really have a second look. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9382.125s">You</a> know, when the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, I think it's could be almost 12-13 years ago, came out with the CPA tax, we were supposed to, like other cities and towns, get a percentage of what the profit was on the state's annual profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9395.754s">We</a> haven't gotten anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9397.515s">So</a> you're really putting the burden right back on the Medford taxpayer, or the Medford city government to go forward and look for that type of development, look for that type of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9407.8s">Well,</a> here's your chance. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9409.361s">Before</a> you get into the, you know, Worcester just got through passing, I don't know if you folks realize it, they just got through passing on April 29th, March 9th of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9420.166s">The</a> registry as it relates to single and two family and three family homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9424.79s">They</a> had that, they voted on that in September of 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9428.311s">And</a> it took them two years before they implemented it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9432.952s">They</a> are now meeting in their next main meeting to make revisions to it because of the pushback, because there's a lot of stringent material into that registry. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9442.274s">But</a> the best part about the whole thing, as the city manager said, he's willing to make changes and tone it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9448.396s">Can</a> you imagine having, if you don't go and register, you're gonna get a $300 fine, and every single day you don't register, it's a $300 fine? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9455.837s">That's</a> kind of excessive, really excessive. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9458.898s">I</a> mean, you don't wanna go to these extremes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9461.218s">And</a> what you do wanna, if you really believe in what you're talking about, you wanna have a full-blown discussions with the pros and the cons, and how this thing can or cannot work, and how does it fit into the city of Medford's lifestyle. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9476.181s">Mr.</a> Chairman, with all due respect, I do not see large corporations coming into our city in Medford, street after street, buying and taking over real estate, turning it over and making a huge profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9488.329s">If</a> a single person, be it yourself or any member of the council, has the ability to do it, good luck to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9494.093s">That's</a> what America is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9496.074s">If</a> you're trying to reduce the rents, you're trying to reduce the cost of living, trying to reduce everything else, then speak to your state legislature, speak to your federal authorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=9505.72s">They're</a> the ones that should be looking out for you, just as well as your local authorities.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3186.122s">My</a> name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, former member of this August body, and I'm really getting confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3192.83s">It's</a> been almost eight years since I've been back before this council, and I've been here three times since December. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3198.697s">And</a> I feel like there's something wrong with this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3201.241s">You're</a> going in a direction that doesn't speak about the Medford City Council taking care of Medford City issues, streets, sidewalks, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3216.053s">Also,</a> my concern with this is, is the City of Medford City Council going to go into a public service agency? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3223.171s">by</a> going into housing and being property reviewers, and you talk about a registry that a homeowner has to go and apply, well, I'm quite sure you're gonna charge them a fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3234.821s">And</a> it's another money grab for the city of Medford, unfoundly, and it's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3239.805s">And</a> in the very last line of your document here, Councilor Lazzaro, I mean, excuse me, Councilor Callahan, I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3248.692s">you</a> indicate that this is going to be good for our climate and our affordable housing goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3255.277s">Well,</a> let me ask you something, as you folks going to manage this, you know, you have a program here that you want to create a review between now and when I don't see any name here as it relates to a real estate group of people that should be involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3270.149s">Because</a> if anybody knows the whereabouts of the city, and the renters, it would be the real estate people because they're the ones that are renting out. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3278.436s">not</a> renting in. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3279.937s">So</a> what purpose would the city council have to try to tell a real estate agent or its company that this is who you have to rent to? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3288.122s">These</a> are the type of people and then what are we going to do stop making a registry of who you are renting to and be discriminatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3295.467s">In</a> fact, in the future, toward a certain class or an ethnic group of people.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3307.569s">city</a> of Medford last year, and once again, this year put out in their documents, a it's called a notice of tenant rights and resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3317.097s">And</a> if you look into the tenants rights and resources, it also makes reference to what the state law allows you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3324.022s">Now,</a> if there's something wrong with a tenant or renter, they have many places to go, they can go to <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3331.428s">MCAD</a> in Boston, they can go to state real estate board, you can go to your right downstairs here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3337.496s">And</a> you can also go to the public health department. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3340.44s">Right</a> now they have five available ways for renter feels that they're being in frowned upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3347.088s">But</a> every good real estate broker knows whether it's in the city of Medford or any other place, that the fact of the matter is they're going to try to get the best person that they can, who can afford to pay the rent, and it's not going to be subject to a background check to their ethnic background. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3362.932s">Because</a> that unfortunately, is where this is going to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3365.992s">Because</a> once you get somebody in there, they're going to want to know where did you come from? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3370.694s">Let</a> me see your references. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3372.134s">And</a> where were you renting last? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3373.694s">That's</a> not what this council's job is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3376.816s">What</a> an answer!
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3386.119s">Pardon</a> me?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3387.7s">You</a> don't know you haven't gotten there yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3389.822s">You</a> just you just have you just I'm not gonna I'm not gonna sit here and say that we're going to hear you have discrimination as the chair as the chair.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3408.457s">I</a> didn't say you were you said you're going to put a registry.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3412.961s">Mr.</a> President, what's the registry going to include? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3415.523s">Ask</a> the maker of the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3416.924s">You</a> cannot come here with resolutions and not be able to answer the questions for what you're looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3422.288s">Then</a> you don't belong here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3423.609s">Go</a> someplace else. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3424.83s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3439.144s">I'm</a> just frustrated. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3440.825s">And</a> probably taking it out on all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3443.207s">But</a> I am taking it out on you for a particular purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3445.769s">I'm</a> going to repeat myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3446.929s">I</a> have a bad habit of repeating myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3448.931s">Please</a> just do what you were elected to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3452.613s">Well,</a> you guys went out there and campaigned and rang on the doorbells and asked people to vote for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3457.256s">Did</a> you tell him you wanted to put a registry for housing in there? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3460.659s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3461.019s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3471.963s">Let</a> me just conclude by saying the following.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3476.204s">Well,</a> you know something, just relax. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3478.345s">You</a> had a little do to do with their Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3481.025s">You</a> took my time up. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3482.726s">I'm</a> gonna ask Mrs. Callahan, I'm gonna ask Mrs. Callahan to withdraw the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3488.72s">and</a> think this thing through, if you really think it's worth something, come back at another day with definitive answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3495.565s">So</a> you don't have an audience that's screaming and yelling that they don't want it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3499.187s">Maybe</a> there is something that can work its way out. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3501.789s">Maybe</a> if you work with the real estate brokers in this city, it can make some kind of sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3506.052s">And</a> the two person homeowner doesn't have to pay a fee to get himself registered or her registered. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3511.495s">And</a> at the same time, there's going to be none of this background check <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3515.478s">that</a> revolves itself around where I am, who I am, what my ethnic background is, what my financial status might be- Thank you, Mr. Penta, your time is up. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3523.161s">No,</a> wait a minute, wait a minute.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3524.782s">Wait</a> a minute, I'm not through yet.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=3542.164s">You</a> took time away from me to talk to Councilor Scott.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11581.727s">Robert</a> Penta zero summit road former member of the August body. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11585.268s">Number</a> one local government is what it's all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11587.409s">So</a> we're not talking about state government here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11589.47s">We're</a> not talking about federal government and I don't really care what was on that shot about other cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11594.673s">We're</a> talking about our city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11597.894s">And</a> for 12 consecutive years, his name was Council President Bob Miyako, it was emphasized every single night during those 12 years of city council meetings, that this was the people's forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11610.26s">This</a> is the only place that they could go for redress, whether they went to a department, the mayor, what have you, they were dissatisfied. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11617.643s">And</a> there were nights we stayed here till 12 and one o'clock in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11621.645s">And</a> that didn't bother me because that's what the job was all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11626.294s">First</a> and second of all, if you have a meeting as you've had over the past, since December now coming forward, when you have lines of people waiting to speak, let them speak first. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11636.781s">The</a> people at home, they're sitting in their chairs, they're sitting in their comfort zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11641.044s">You</a> have people here that need to go to work the next day, have paid for a babysitter, or just came down here because it's finally got to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11647.569s">Something</a> is really interested. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11649.49s">Two</a> of your free people that are sponsoring this, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11653.294s">have</a> never done anything here in the city of Medford that should even qualify them to make a result of going to two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11660.322s">And</a> then you go from two minutes to three, just like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11663.305s">I</a> mean, that's the way it was the consideration for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11665.688s">Why</a> don't you just keep it at five minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11668.351s">In</a> 2022, you went from 10 to five and everything seemed to work out. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11671.835s">And</a> the only reason why these meetings are getting to be as long as they are, unfortunately, because you're every other week. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11677.518s">So</a> maybe you should go back to being every week. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11680.259s">And</a> that way the the agendas won't be as long and they won't be as contentious. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11684.401s">But</a> to worry about the length of time that you would have to sit here, you get $30,000 a year to supposedly represent the people of this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11694.403s">And</a> don't you dare think you're gonna come back here and ask for a pay raise because you have to stay late at night and you do committee meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11701.966s">That's</a> crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11702.646s">If</a> anything, it would be wise for you to make a decrease in your salary because of the conditions that the city of Medford is in right now to show and put your good fest forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11710.808s">But</a> that'll never happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11712.509s">just</a> like a pay raise will probably come forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11715.17s">You</a> know, the sad part about this whole thing is, again, you're spending time on what? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11720.893s">Just</a> tell me what is so bad to sit here and listen to someone for five minutes? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11726.476s">What</a> is so bad that you have to go and look at another community and see what they do? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11730.778s">You're</a> talking about Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11732.678s">And</a> if you spent your time doing your homework, when you're out there campaigning, you would realize you're talking about Medford, not Arlington, Cambridge, Somerville, Malden, or Everett, or Chelsea, <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11743.944s">Let</a> me ask any one of you when you're out campaigning, and you rang the doorbells for your votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11749.106s">Did</a> you spend more than two minutes and say, I've got to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11751.827s">I</a> only give them two minutes to speak to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11753.988s">Of</a> course not. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11755.549s">That</a> would be the height of insulting. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11757.85s">But</a> you want to insult people coming up here who pay your salary with our tax dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11765.353s">That's</a> a shame, that is wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11768.054s">And</a> not to single anyone out of you, I'm gonna blame all of you, because if all of you vote for the craziness of this, and I call this a stupid resolution, because it makes no sense in the interest of good government. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11781.457s">You</a> can talk about Harvard all you want, you can have your special days. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11785.458s">And</a> just as an information to Councilor Tseng, you indicated this month is Ramadan. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11789.7s">Well,</a> do you know what today is? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11791.803s">Do</a> you know what today is? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11792.584s">Today</a> is National Autism Day, sponsored by the United Nations. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11796.127s">I</a> don't see that on the calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11797.909s">That</a> to me is as important as your Ramadan. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11800.491s">But</a> you people want to talk about all these national issues and put them on the calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11804.996s">What</a> does that do to help the city of Medford, the people of Medford, to pay the taxes on a daily basis that go to work here? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11812.683s">I</a> strongly suggest the three members who put this forward, cancel it, take it off the ballot, and leave it alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11819.807s">And</a> let the good people of our city have their five minutes at the podium, have their say, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11826.25s">And</a> hopefully, if you go back to maybe every week, the amount of resolutions that you put on there won't be as contentious, and it won't be so controversial, you won't have to stay here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11836.655s">But</a> even if you do have to stay here, eat it, because that's your job. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11841.357s">That's</a> what you signed up for. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11842.938s">You</a> wanted to be a council to represent the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11845.699s">And</a> if I heard you correctly, Mr. President, you said you've spoken to people to disagree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11850.261s">So</a> to some people from an hour, two hours, whatever it might be, and you didn't accomplish anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11855.803s">You</a> spent two hours of your time on a conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11858.684s">But</a> you want to cut us down to two minutes of this podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11861.545s">That</a> makes absolutely no sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11863.167s">And</a> it's absolutely contradictory to the whole premise of what this resolution is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11867.414s">Again,</a> I respectfully ask the three members who put this forward to cancel it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11871.76s">And</a> also, there's a book, it's called The Naked Socialist. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11874.924s">Anyone</a> have ever heard of it? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11876.852s">It's</a> a very interesting book, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11878.994s">It's</a> a naked socialist.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11880.735s">Pardon</a> me?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11883.558s">No,</a> it's not about you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11884.478s">I'm</a> gonna just read with you at the very conclusion of what it says. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11887.841s">This</a> goes back to 1968. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11890.423s">A</a> lady by the name of Ezra Taft Benson, she was the former secretary of agriculture under President Dwight Eisenhower, gave a speech outlining the following- Mr. Penta, you're five minutes in. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11900.952s">Regarding</a> public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11902.654s">One</a> line, and it says the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11905.376s">Government</a> may not possess more rights than those held by the individual, and government may not simply assume them as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11914.223s">When</a> it does, you're operating toward tyranny. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11916.826s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11917.646s">Let</a> me just finish, please, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11920.308s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11921.229s">I</a> would can I just finish please. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11923.17s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11924.271s">Can</a> I just finish please sentence. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11926.993s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11927.913s">I</a> would just hope that this council does not find itself being involved in the naked terrorists and any kind of socialistic communistic movement by stopping the people from speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=11940.701s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15396.441s">Why</a> do I only have two when I should have five?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15400.763s">Well,</a> you're tired, you want to go home, is this all about?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15408.465s">Show</a> me the rule on the council, because rule 16 says five minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15413.227s">That's</a> what it says.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15422.131s">Can</a> I finish what I'm saying? <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15423.132s">You</a> have two minutes, we accept two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15424.112s">Well,</a> you shouldn't be speaking from the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15425.753s">You</a> have no right to make an opinion from the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15429.574s">You</a> have no right from the chair to make an opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15432.316s">Excuse</a> me.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15434.797s">You're</a> against Robert's rules of order.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15438.338s">I'd</a> like to ask the question.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15442.0s">I'd</a> like to ask the vice president question.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15444.801s">We</a> may I know I can't.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15448.002s">On</a> the motion of this meeting, I am not the chair of this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=15451.343s">City</a> Council meeting bears.<h2><a href="../2024-06-01_FLTVHcz7fAI/2024-06-01_FLTVHcz7fAI.html">City Council 01-23-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9763.941s">My</a> name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass, former member of this August body. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9770.385s">First</a> of all, let me start by saying, what does this pay raise have to do with education? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9777.142s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9777.902s">Number</a> two, there's no demanding from the public for any pay raise for the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9783.785s">And</a> lastly, there's no professional city population job description pay report that even substantiates or supports what the council has alluded to. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9794.829s">The</a> gender issue that was alleged this past December is nothing more than a sexual red herring allegation of discrimination that has no merit to the issue before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9806.494s">The</a> job is what the job is. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9807.995s">The</a> responsibility is what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9809.456s">It</a> doesn't say it has to be male or female. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9813.66s">That's</a> the red herring to the whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9815.541s">But</a> if this proposal were to pass, should we now compare all our municipal positions with the same amount of financial equity and equality as compared to each position, especially with those having different responsibilities? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9829.052s">Fire,</a> police, school teachers, they all have different job duties and responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9834.841s">But</a> if we're looking at something that's now saying the school committee should have equity pay to that of a city councilor, well, you're setting a standard here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9842.388s">And</a> this standard should be compared to, right now, what is presently found in your municipal contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9849.275s">Additionally,</a> if this proposal is to pass a comprehensive review, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9854.56s">should</a> be undertaking to set a years of service pay scale to be compatible with all of the municipal employee negotiations, comparing newly elected newcomers to both the city council and the school committee at the beginning of the pay scale formula. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9869.046s">Therefore,</a> for the new members in the council, as compared to the new members on the school committee, why should either one of you reap the benefit of the maximum pay <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9878.63s">when</a> in fact all other municipal employees start at a base pay and they go through a process. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9885.112s">So</a> if you're looking at this equity for both and all sides, then let the council and the school committee also be put in the same type of position. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9896.533s">Okay,</a> as such by granting the city council additional type of raise without having increasing any educational value, without having any community support for it, and without any professional city population job description report only demonstrates the power of behind the scenes internal politics, where the power of the dollar personally overpowers the needs of our public school educational needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9924.972s">We</a> have surrounding communities, and I took the six surrounding communities that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9928.674s">Arlington,</a> they get paid $3,000 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9931.275s">Everett,</a> they get paid $11,500. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9933.036s">Malden,</a> they get paid $7,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9934.917s">Somerville,</a> they get paid $16,600. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9936.218s">And</a> Methodist, they get paid $12,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9938.639s">Methodist</a> is the second highest paid school committee of the surrounding areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9944.468s">You</a> serve in these jobs for the quality of giving good education to the community, not for how much money or you should be paid equal to that or in excess of our total to the amount of what a city councilor makes. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9959.321s">Last</a> December, the pay concerns for paraprofessionals, classroom assistants, custodians, substitute teachers, et cetera, were discussed, but they've yet to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9969.509s">This</a> hall was full with almost 200 teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9972.938s">At</a> the city council, the school committee pay raise increase without any proposal to differentiate the differences between the city council and school committee responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9982.09s">As</a> the gentleman just stated, showing the need such raise or pay equality has yet to be proven. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9989.397s">Therefore,</a> at last meeting on December 12, these were the issues that were of concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=9995.261s">A,</a> needing additional instructional hours for students, AP classes, class size needs, athletic programming, student activities, school library resources, counseling services, school security, custodial school maintenance, after school programming, and something that's gonna creep up on you fellas, it's unprepared for migrant student educational <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10019.219s">studies</a> and support. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10021.381s">Now,</a> these are all dollar amounts that need to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10024.923s">And</a> if you are going to take on the proposal that's before us over the next two years, approximately $76,000, you're taking that $76,000 away from your school department educational budget that could be used somehow to get into some of these programs, if not all of them, to some degree and a percentage of whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10045.762s">The</a> pay scale for those caring for these programs was at issue, and yet as of today, nothing has been done to resolve any of the issues as presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10055.033s">The</a> City Council School Committee pay raise proposal does not recognize and connect to the short and long term needs of our public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10063.664s">So</a> when and if you folks are sitting here and you're discussing these needs, and you think that the school committee should be making more money, and you have a school committee that's been around for so many years, allegedly for 20, if that's what the issue is, well then let's, what do we need to motivate and show that their need and they're worthy of it other than <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10082.987s">You</a> know, they should be making the same as in Worcester. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10086.568s">They</a> have an audience that does say up to 50% of what a city council makes. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10090.19s">But</a> their job responsibilities may be entirely different. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10092.851s">Do</a> you realize right now, a kindergarten assistant, if we were to follow this pay raise as proposed, a kindergarten assistant who works five days a week and is subject to everything in that classroom as every other teacher, will be making $1,000 less <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10110.336s">then</a> this pay proposal for a school committee person, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10113.937s">Makes</a> no sense at all because a school committee person doesn't have to sign in, doesn't have to check in, has no responsibility as it relates to, you know, what am I doing on a daily basis that says I'm doing something that's educationally correct for this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10128.763s">By</a> granting from the city council, let's put it this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10134.906s">There</a> should be some justification before you folks <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10138.43s">from,</a> and it can't be from the at present school committee because there'd be a conflict of interest because they have a financial gain from it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10144.793s">So</a> it's gotta be as according to the state law, the chapter is gonna come from your folks in the state council. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10149.836s">But</a> what has this school committee done, especially with its new members that has said Medford's education is better, Medford's discipline is better, and that's seriously questioned as to what's going on up at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10163.439s">The</a> sports programs is getting better. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10165.76s">Parents</a> are getting more involved, but also at the same time, where is the educational standard in comparison to other cities and towns throughout the Commonwealth of Massachusetts? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10176.283s">Has</a> the school committee made such great strides that, hey, they're working together with the teachers and their organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10184.365s">When</a> you had here last week, and I know you have some new folks that are here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10188.787s">On</a> December 12th, there was almost 150, 175 teachers that were here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10193.2s">And</a> they explain to you the plight of not only being in the classroom, being attacked, where their pay is. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10200.203s">Some</a> of them have to work five years, five years before they even make $25,000 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10206.905s">That's</a> unconscionable. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10208.666s">Justin,</a> I understand that you want to give them a pay raise, you know, but I didn't hear your logic behind it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10215.929s">Well,</a> he's the one, it's his resolution.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10222.679s">Okay,</a> through the chair, Justin, I know you wanna give them this Bay Race, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10227.441s">But</a> you haven't said anything, none of you have expressed any comment as it relates to, they deserve it for the value of what they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10235.224s">Can</a> anybody explain to me, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10237.765s">If</a> you really want to give somebody a pay raise, isn't the job description and your job duties and your employer supposed to do the review of you? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10246.208s">Now,</a> of course they can say, the Medford taxpayer is your reviewer and you run for office and they elect you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10252.25s">Okay,</a> that's all well and good. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10254.251s">But</a> the Medford taxpayer doesn't pay your salary, it's the Medford City Council according to state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10259.997s">So</a> the Medford City Council, by right, can make a great demand on this school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10264.499s">If</a> you really want to improve it, we'll look at this in two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10267.68s">Let's</a> see what this new school committee does over the next two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10270.801s">Let's</a> just see through your intervention with the Medford Teachers Association and from the superintendent all the way down, that everything that's taking place in all our schools, from kindergarten all the way up to the high school, has gotten better. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10282.004s">Grades</a> have gotten better. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10283.925s">Discipline</a> has gotten better and under control. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10288.174s">That</a> would make a big difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10289.575s">And</a> maybe people might say, hey, okay, you're working toward it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10293.216s">But</a> when you have a job that you don't have to sign in, check in and give any report as to what you do and why you're doing how you do it, and expect to start off at a higher rate than people who have been here for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10305.782s">That's</a> just not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10307.643s">And</a> the last thing, let me just say this as it relates to that, and I told you Arlington gets $3,000, Everett gets $11,500, Malden gets $7,000, Somerville gets $16,500, and Method gets $12,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10318.977s">We're</a> the second highest one of the surrounding communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10323.723s">A</a> kindergarten <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10325.609s">through</a> the chair to Justin, a kindergarten teacher assistant after the second year gets $21,568. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10332.391s">That's</a> $1,000 less than what you wanna propose to a school committee person who doesn't go to this job every day, like the kindergarten teacher goes to school every day, five days a week, and does everything that education says of that person. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10350.556s">Maybe</a> you should have a sit down. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10352.912s">with</a> the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10354.713s">Because</a> they can't tell you that they want it because it would be a financial benefit to them, that would be a conflict of interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10361.578s">But</a> somebody needs to understand, just because they need to get paid more, because they're not getting paid enough now. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10368.383s">Well,</a> they're getting paid $12,000, and if they don't want it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10371.545s">And</a> through the chair to Mrs. Callahan, not for anything, you made the comment that you think that, you know, to get good candidates, you need to pay more. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10379.63s">I'm</a> gonna respectfully disagree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10381.992s">a</a> good candidate is someone who wants to run for the job because they believe that better things can be done and I can do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10388.195s">And</a> if I can't do it, then the people won't reelect me that salary has got nothing to do with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10394.017s">And</a> the salary should not be used for your own personal gain. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10397.779s">I'm</a> going to make $30,000 a year now more 24,000, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10401.861s">And</a> the sad part about the whole thing in conclusion, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10404.815s">If</a> this proposal were to go through, you're taking $74,000 a year out of this Medford School Department education budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10413.077s">It's</a> bad enough now for them to work on a daily basis without having enough of the money that should be in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10419.558s">Now</a> you're gonna take another $74,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10421.339s">And</a> you know, where does that go? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10424.379s">How</a> do you explain that to the Medford taxpayer? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10426.86s">You</a> can't explain it to me because I wouldn't buy it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10429.921s">Because</a> right now, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10431.596s">The</a> Medford School Committee is working with all they can do just to maintain their budget and to get by and to start taking more money away to give it to an elected official who does absolutely nothing to enhance or embellish or make better school education. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10450.595s">That's,</a> it just doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10453.296s">So</a> if I understand you correctly, I believe you said you would like to have this go and have a decision come up by the end of December of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10460.479s">I</a> believe that's what you said. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10462.259s">That</a> would be okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10463.4s">But</a> to vote on this tonight, I think it would be wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10466.721s">I</a> think it would serve no purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10468.622s">And</a> I don't think it would be good for Medford public school education. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10472.483s">That's</a> my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10473.544s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10506.561s">Can</a> I ask a question to the chair? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10507.901s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10508.482s">Did</a> I misunderstand Mrs. Cowell? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10510.283s">Did</a> you say in part of your questioning there is, I think you- She listed a variety of different reforms, rank choice- All right, it was one of the things that you said you wanted illegal aliens to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10520.887s">Did</a> you say that?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10537.305s">Oh,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=10541.468s">I'm</a> more than happy to answer any questions.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11251.067s">Yeah,</a> just a point of information, just as a notice for this council, I think it was three, maybe five to six years ago, there was a report that came back from the Department of Revenue, Mass Department of Revenue that said, the old school thought was in the council budget, you could only decrease, but that's not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11266.959s">You</a> can now make appropriations that go the other way. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11270.722s">So</a> I think it's just something I think you really need to take into consideration as it relates to something that you might see in the budget, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11277.438s">where</a> the old school was that you only could reduce if you wanted to save money, so there would be no way that you could transfer that money to another section, but that's not true because now you can look at certain sections within your budget as it relates to appropriating for or making something less. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11294.267s">And</a> I think that would be very key, so let's stick to your, Councilor Collins' comment as it relates to this could be a beginning step. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11304.192s">If</a> it's going to be a beginning step, <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11306.753s">it</a> should be a step that parallels every single municipal employee from step one. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11311.897s">Some</a> school teachers, I believe, have 10 steps before they get to the top, but an elected official has no steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11319.082s">It's</a> never been that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11319.802s">So</a> if you're going to put everybody into the same genre, so to speak, well then maybe <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11325.786s">An</a> elected person can maybe have five or six steps, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11328.849s">Don't</a> forget, one of the real benefits of an elected official is if you serve for 10 years or more, you get a pension. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11336.236s">You</a> get a pension from here, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11338.999s">There</a> are some cities and towns that don't offer pensions. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11342.478s">So</a> besides the salary, you're also getting the benefit of a pension with a minimum of 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11349.283s">So</a> I think that really needs to be taken into consideration when you're talking about pay scales and pay raises and whether it be for the council or the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11357.682s">And</a> one of the things that seemed to be a juggernaut in the school and the municipal side is just that particular issue, whether it's in the fire or the police department when they're in their pension areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11368.813s">So</a> it's really something that serves you folks with a good benefit, school department issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11376.064s">school</a> committee person, same thing as a city councilor, but you really, you just don't want to throw that aside without realizing that you're getting a benefit that a lot of cities and towns do not offer. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=11389.536s">So</a> just thought I'd let you know.<h2><a href="../2024-10-05_j424Dcv3DNY/2024-10-05_j424Dcv3DNY.html">City Council 12-12-23</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4111.271s">I</a> have a two-page statement.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4113.992s">My</a> name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., a former member of this August party on the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4120.255s">Massachusetts</a> General Laws, Chapter 71, Section 52, does grant to the City Council, by a majority vote and by the city charter, the responsibility of how much members of the school committee get paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4132.02s">But</a> historically, the city council has paid more than the city school committee because the council's responsibilities exceed those of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4139.885s">The</a> city council responsibilities include, but are not limited to enacting ordinances, zoning, fire and police, public safety requirements, setting the city's tax rate, and has the final authority over the city and school department budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4153.895s">As</a> examples of major differences between one challenging equal pay for equal work between the city council and the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4162.38s">Further,</a> just as in any business, job responsibilities and pay are what one is applying for. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4168.324s">Under</a> this proposal, it is a gender attack being disguised as pay parity, for equal pay for equal work, for which it is not. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4176.008s">The</a> proposed school department 100% plus pay increase will be paid from the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4181.952s">Let's</a> take a look at what that means. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4184.233s">Annually,</a> we are barely able to meet the resources we have now at our school's disposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4190.282s">If</a> we cut further any of our school resources by not funding them, and instead giving them 100% plus salary increase for school committee members, we should be concerned as to where we are heading. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4201.477s">If</a> we are to cut some $90,000, because that's what it'll come to, plus each year from going forward from the school department budget, the results can possibly affect the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4211.306s">Fewer</a> instructional hours for students. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4213.748s">Elimination</a> of AP classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4215.89s">Increased</a> class sizes. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4217.531s">Elimination</a> of some athletic programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4219.853s">Elimination</a> of support for some school activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4222.736s">Elimination</a> of school librarians.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4226.486s">I</a> think the rules say five minutes if you check the council rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4229.429s">Reductions</a> in council services, school security being at risk, reduced custodial cleaning and maintenance, after school programming, migrant student education support, and unbeing prepared for migrant student educational support. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4244.904s">I</a> meant the public schools short and long range term should not be subject to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4249.387s">And</a> if the school committee pay increase does go through, what do you say about the salary for the everyday school paraprofessionals? <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4257.051s">As</a> example, every class assistant under five years would finally earn $30,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4261.593s">And</a> everyday kindergarten teachers after five years would only earn $25,980. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4268.462s">This</a> after five years, while the school committee would receive $29,000 annually for a part time job with no everyday reporting requirements and responsibilities is at best. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4280.952s">If</a> the city council is to accept this ridiculous proposal, maybe the council should then set a pay scale standard for both the city council and the school committee for years of service as compared to pay scales a standard for just every other municipal employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4296.577s">Using</a> the presently proposed gender issue of females being more in number who are elected to serve is not only discriminatory, but a sexist allegation that has no merit. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4309.824s">And</a> what about a person who claims to be other? <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4313.525s">And</a> what about when trends tend to go back to when men become more elected than women? <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4319.048s">Being</a> elected is a gender neutral opportunity, not to be disguised as pay parity for equal pay for equal work. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4326.555s">As</a> I said in the beginning, job responsibilities and pay are the guidelines for which one is applying for. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4333.001s">As</a> of this meeting, there has been no input from community members on the Medford School Committee regarding this 100 plus salary increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4343.69s">As</a> a thought, and this flows right into what you said Councilor Scarpelli, if the council is so inclined to accept this measure of allowing this red herring issue of more females than males being elected officials, then maybe in the spirit of physical conservatism and the council being magnanimous, the council should entertain <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4363.806s">being</a> paid the same $12,000, as we said before, annual salary that the school committee is currently paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4370.447s">Therefore,</a> on the city side, if the city can save $90,000 annually from their city council salary, which can be used for municipal needs, the school department, one sentence, the school department will not lose the $90,000 annually that can go to public school education.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8548.132s">of</a> what you've got going through right now is the fact that you just have a nice brand new baby, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8552.373s">And</a> you're a brand new mother. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8553.934s">And</a> that's very important for what I wanna say, because there's a cost factor that goes along with all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8560.436s">It's</a> a mental factor and it's a financial factor. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8563.236s">And</a> I'm quite sure you realize what it costs now having a young child, what that entails on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8569.538s">When</a> we hear the fact right now that there are additional pressures that are gonna be placed on individuals, <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8576.297s">whether</a> it's a single family, because that's the only one we heard, it was a single family. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8580.258s">We</a> didn't hear about the two family, the three family, the condos, or the apartment dwellers. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8585.38s">We</a> didn't hear that, that information hasn't been brought forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8588.201s">And</a> it should have been brought forward if you're going to be thorough in this presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8592.203s">And</a> when you wanna talk about spending, or controlled spending, you need to talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8598.925s">So</a> as Councilor Knight has alluded to, <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8602.203s">not</a> thinking this be the right way to go, and I agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8605.704s">You've</a> never really had, as Councilor Marks alluded to, an outside independent order on every single department that would justify this council going into an administrative decision with the city administration to discuss, we need to now go into a Proposition 2 1⁄2 override. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8624.591s">You</a> folks are sitting here tonight with not one city administration here. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8629.409s">I</a> don't know if they were asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8631.192s">I</a> don't know if it was intentional for them not to be asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8634.777s">But</a> it would have made a big difference in trying to understand why we are at this stage at 12 and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8642.928s">Two</a> and a half weeks ago, you folks voted at a budget meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8646.855s">At</a> the beginning of the meeting, you voted seven to nothing not to approve the budget, but after the mayor came in and a quarter or two in the morning, you voted seven to nothing for the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8655.263s">So</a> what was asked for and what was gotten all took place between seven o'clock and quarter to in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8661.93s">Now,</a> is that an exact budget science? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8663.972s">I</a> don't think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8665.69s">Is</a> that the right way to go? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8667.331s">You</a> have a proposition here tonight being proposed to $12 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8670.874s">Where</a> is the statistical information? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8673.576s">Where</a> are the reports? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8675.438s">Where</a> are the reports from the school department? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8677.539s">Not</a> one school committee person is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8679.701s">Not</a> one school administration person is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8682.063s">The</a> superintendent should be here if she thought she was gonna be so lucky to get almost $6 million out of a $12 million proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8689.369s">And</a> then we go on the city side, <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8691.31s">We're</a> there. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8692.23s">You</a> have seven unions in this community, but there only seems to be two that have been recognized here. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8697.052s">And</a> very conveniently, they don't mention the Veterans Affairs Office, the veterans in this community who paid who paid through their lives for us to be here and give our commentary. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8712.157s">To</a> be exact, you need reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8714.658s">And</a> the only way you can have a good report is to make sure that you require it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8720.66s">Now,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8722.843s">I</a> think I heard Councilor, I don't know where he disappeared to it's his resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8727.148s">You</a> know, Councilor Bears I believe said you know we've been asking for the last seven months and this and that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8733.355s">And</a> the mayor hasn't come around. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8735.017s">Well</a> you know something, who has the greatest power in this city to control the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8740.987s">It's</a> the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8743.069s">And</a> what you also can do at any one given time, whatever that mayor, he or she wants, this council can vote against it until you guys and girls get what you want and what you ask for, because that's the way the game is played. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8757.18s">I'll</a> help you if you help me, but if you're not gonna help me and you just go along and you vote for it, well, you're just as much <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8764.805s">Just</a> as much to blame think about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8767.046s">You've</a> allowed these budgets to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8769.466s">And</a> if you know they knew this was going on, and you did nothing about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8773.787s">And</a> if you started in January asking for these financial reports and you didn't get them. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8778.669s">Then</a> you should have stopped anything that came from the mayor's office, looking for approval until you got your reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8784.47s">Your</a> responsibility and for the city is to run its financial management, and when you have intermittent and you don't have administrators in this building that can come forward to explain what 12 and a half million dollars will do more than $550 on a single family home. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8801.693s">You</a> got the doubles. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8802.713s">What</a> about the commercial piece of people property. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8805.394s">You</a> haven't even discussed them, and in the following years they keep going after two and a half automatically goes up each and every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8811.975s">It's</a> something to really think about, because this is not chump change. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8815.776s">This</a> isn't $1, $2, or $3 million that you probably could find if you went through that budget and you cut through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8822.258s">This</a> is $12 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8824.439s">And</a> who come up with the $12 million? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8826.9s">Two</a> Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8828.74s">Two</a> Councilors who don't even pay real estate tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8831.441s">They</a> don't understand the value.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8853.836s">I'm</a> gonna continue what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8855.277s">If</a> you understood, if you paid real estate tax, you would understand the impact that this would.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8904.473s">Now,</a> you maybe missed my point. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8906.634s">My</a> point was this, not owning the real estate and having to pay those additional taxes, that gets itself disseminated down to you as a renter. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8914.936s">So</a> if you, as a renter, are gonna pay the difference in the increase, but you're putting the burden back onto the who. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8920.578s">And</a> if she has a tax, if she's paying a rental tax, <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8924.019s">that</a> she can afford right now, maybe about a two or $300 a month increase, she won't be able to and that's what we're talking about people on fixed incomes, seniors on fixed income. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8934.005s">And</a> when you hear the story, when you're watching on television, every dollar counts. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8938.127s">Is</a> it going to be for my medicine? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8939.708s">Is</a> it going to be for my where I'm living? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8941.949s">Is</a> it going to be to put gas in my car? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8943.71s">Is</a> it going to be for food? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8945.091s">Is</a> it going to be that I can't go out? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8946.532s">I</a> got to stay home? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8948.153s">That's</a> what we're dealing with right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8949.435s">You're</a> dealing with an economic impact in this country that's affecting everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8953.32s">And</a> that $12 million will kill this city of Medford because the city of Medford will never recover from something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8960.65s">If</a> you vote for that, you're going to... <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8963.333s">If</a> you vote for that $12 million, you're going to take away what Medford is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8968.536s">Councilor</a> Knight was absolutely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8970.777s">Sit</a> down, have a discussion, go over the whole thing, and ask for an independent outside audit to address all these departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8978.942s">That's</a> what you need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8983.224s">You</a> know, we're too good of a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8984.965s">We</a> are way too good of a city to let something like this happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=8989.552s">We've</a> sat here for years with former Councilors and myself, and we never, never experienced anything that was presented in the middle of the night. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9000.559s">That's</a> what July is, it's the heat of the night, it's hot out, it's almost 90 degrees. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9006.413s">where</a> the people that this hall should be full of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9009.617s">And</a> it's not because as Councilman alluded to, there was an issue way back a couple of two or three years ago in Mystic Avenue in the month of August when they had a public hearing and all the people showed up and they got so scared as to what's going on, they canceled the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9022.412s">And</a> after they canceled the meeting, they took the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9024.835s">No</a> way should this happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9026.757s">Let</a> me just leave you with this last thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9029.499s">Your</a> own Rule 19 on the Medford City Council states that the Medford City Council shall not approve of any bond or expenditure that does not have a written explanation of such expenditure at least seven days prior to said vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9044.229s">You</a> got this three to four days prior to today. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9047.652s">That's</a> not seven days. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9049.353s">You</a> cannot even vote on this tonight because your own rules say it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9053.676s">And</a> your own rules also state <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9057.012s">The</a> following any financial paper appearing on the council agenda for the first time, shall be automatically laid on the table for one week when such action is requested by any one member, I'm quite sure there was at least one number here willing to put that on the table unless they have another motion to go by, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9075.965s">I</a> didn't mean to get to an argument with you and I wasn't trying to be right. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9078.546s">I</a> was just trying to compliment you. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9079.607s">I</a> got my day years mixed up. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9081.528s">The</a> fact of the matter is I look at individuals today and I say to myself, how do they afford seven $800,000 houses? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9090.712s">How</a> do they afford when they have two cars and they have kids running all over? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9093.833s">Maybe</a> you must be maxed out to the answer degree in debt. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9098.447s">We</a> never did that growing up. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9099.848s">We</a> worked for everything we got and we went along as we went. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9103.452s">This</a> is huge, $12 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9106.315s">This</a> isn't $1 million or even two that maybe you can figure out how to massage your budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9112.521s">It</a> doesn't work that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9114.86s">to</a> be good Councilors, dismiss this action right now, move yourself into a committee to meet with department heads, hire an outside independent auditor to come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9126.406s">If</a> you could spend, as Councilor Knight said, $300,000 for an outside law firm that should be doing exactly what this law firm and the city of Medford is paying for, there is something wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=9139.013s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-11-18_Blp3jbNtrXg/2024-11-18_Blp3jbNtrXg.html">City Council 05-10-22</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5456.479s">My</a> name is Robert Panto. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5457.54s">I</a> live at Zero Summit Road, a former member of this August body for 36 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5462.958s">For</a> the past 82 years in the city of Medford, you folks have had weekly council meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5469.04s">I've</a> served under both a plan A and a plan E form of government, and they held steadfast, not only to their weekly meetings, they held steadfast that this microphone, this podium right here was the people's voice on a weekly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5485.506s">We've</a> gone through the years, situations, <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5489.849s">in</a> the Wellington area, whereas if you were on every other week situation, the rat problem that took effect a few years ago, would have never got itself involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5500.758s">Then</a> Councilor Caraviello, Councilor Knight can remember people coming from the Morrison Ave Park area regarding in the wintertime storms that took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5509.846s">And</a> if the people had to wait every other week to come down here, their problems would have been exacerbated. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5516.12s">You</a> talked about making decisions as you relate of committee meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5520.842s">If</a> committee meetings are a result of what takes place here at a city council meeting and forwarded to a committee, and the committee does whatever it's work has to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5530.386s">It</a> still has to come back before the council, but it initiated itself right here in the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5535.848s">Tonight</a> was a perfect example. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5538.069s">When</a> the gentleman from the. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5540.555s">front</a> porch came down here and unfortunately all the papers weren't in order until the clerk went downstairs to get the papers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5548.878s">Now,</a> if the papers were not there, he would have had to wait two weeks if this process of two weeks took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5554.72s">That</a> would have been a financial burdensome on that individual through no fault of his own because his papers were filed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5561.002s">And</a> when the chairperson got the papers and he saw they weren't filed and they were signed off properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5566.744s">When</a> all of you folks ran for office like myself, I knew it was on a Tuesday night and I also knew that no matter what the day and the week was, was immaterial to the job and my responsibility to do the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5581.018s">Now,</a> if you folks wanna go to every other week with 18 committees that you have set up, and of those 18 committees, if you decide you wanna have three or four of them or five of them on every other week, and some of you are on the same committees, how is that gonna work during the same time? <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5597.304s">It's</a> just impossible. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5599.645s">Right</a> now, you can meet anywhere, as Councilor Scarpelli alluded to, you can go Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and you're meeting every week. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5606.773s">This</a> podium is here for one particular reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5609.875s">This</a> is the safeguard that a taxpaying citizen has to come here without having to wait, geez, I gotta wait two weeks because the pressing need is happening right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5620.923s">You</a> folks are getting paid $30,000 a year to do this job. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5625.807s">And</a> you know what the time commitment was. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5627.789s">And</a> you also know what the dollar amount was to the salary. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5631.444s">God</a> forbid, if you ever go to every other week, you want to come in here and ask for a pay raise, you really will be adding insult to injury. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5638.588s">Because</a> that's just something that will never pass the muster of why you folks got elected. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5644.332s">You</a> got elected to do one thing, to represent the people the best way you could. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5649.755s">And</a> right now for 82 years it's been every Tuesday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5653.336s">Now</a> Councilor Caraviello says change is good, but all change at all times is not good. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5660.197s">The</a> lack of community input to every other meeting, the lack of a community input as it relates to why are we making this change? <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5667.979s">You</a> have two brand new city councils that just came on this term. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5671.92s">I'm</a> quite sure when they were running for office, this was not an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5675.861s">And</a> since it wasn't an issue then, why is it an issue now? <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5680.222s">Second</a> of all, when you go into the meetings, you talk about the regular meetings of the city council shall be held every two weeks on Tuesday evening at 7pm, beginning the first Tuesday in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5694.507s">Then</a> in the last sentence, it turns around and says the following bit further resolve that these updates become effective on September 1 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5704.742s">So</a> what is it, September 1st or is it January 1st of 2023? <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5708.263s">There's</a> a mix of words there, something is wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5714.364s">Also</a> you talk about here, an emergency meeting shall take place unless immediately undelayed action is deemed to be imperative. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5725.687s">Well,</a> just think about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5727.267s">Does</a> any one of you know right now what an immediate action could be? <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5731.588s">What</a> an emergency could be in somebody's life? <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5734.705s">or</a> some business. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5737.867s">Pardon</a> me? <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5739.928s">Does</a> anybody know what an emergency could be? <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5742.229s">I</a> don't, and neither one of us know.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5750.274s">I'm</a> talking about the community interest for this to make this change.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5774.743s">You</a> presented on the agenda for this evening, the word meetings, and this is a result of the change that took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5780.207s">So</a> is it January 1st or is it September 1st? <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5783.13s">What's</a> it going to be?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5785.431s">So</a> if it's September 1st, then it does not become operative January 1st, but that's not the issue.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5835.017s">No,</a> it doesn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5835.557s">It</a> says in the bottom. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5836.797s">Yeah,</a> September 1st.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5841.978s">I</a> don't think this is no devil coming from the sky.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5852.298s">Thank</a> you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5854.1s">The</a> fact of the matter is simply this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5856.141s">The</a> reason why we're here on a Tuesday night is whether, like last week, you folks only met for maybe 30, 35 minutes, and you've had a pretty easy go from January till now, but once the budget comes in and things start to pick up, okay, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5868.012s">But</a> imagine if you had it every other week. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5870.474s">And</a> once the budget takes place and you start to get into every other week, and you're here four, five, six hours, and then you're going to put a time limit on because you're incapable of probably making an intelligent decision because it's kind of like late night. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5884.042s">Why</a> do you want to disturb something that has worked? <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5887.664s">And</a> more importantly, if you felt such a need for this, and if this council was <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5894.488s">so</a> engrossed in the fact that we had to change this, then why don't you just make it effective beginning September of the next election? <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5901.572s">Why</a> would you do it? <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5902.352s">It</a> wasn't even an election issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5903.993s">So</a> how did this become an issue right now, less than six months into the term?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5928.783s">I</a> understand that, but it's been while it's been, it's not like it didn't come out of the, it came out of the blue, but while it's been discussed, it never got passed.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5940.889s">So</a> the question is to the metric citizenry who are watching this, they're going to have to figure out, they only can come here every other week, but at the same time, at the same time, you have 18 committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5950.154s">So</a> are we going to say between the first week and the beginning of the second week, these 18 committees are going to work and your committee, the holes are going to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5958.512s">I</a> mean, is that going to make any kind of sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5961.055s">There's</a> 18 committees and there's only seven of you, and many of you are on the same committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5965.861s">I</a> mean, so how do you, how do you go through this, this process.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5991.247s">You</a> know what I mean, it's the only place for a public forum, you've got your opinion, I have a forum on what it's a public forum for someone to come and speak on whatever the issue might be, it might be a neighborhood issue that doesn't find itself on the agenda, it might be an emergency that doesn't find itself on the agenda.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6016.653s">You</a> have your opinion, I have mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6018.534s">As</a> far as that goes, Madam President, I said what I had to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6021.816s">I</a> just feel, like I said, it's been 82 years, it's operated under plan E, plan A. It's been every Tuesday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6029.38s">You</a> never really know what the situation might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6031.482s">And</a> when you got elected, you knew. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6033.283s">You</a> knew when you got elected, the meetings were going to be every Tuesday night and subcommittees were whenever they're going to take you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6039.066s">And</a> why should time? <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6041.047s">Why</a> should time even be an issue? <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6043.089s">Whether</a> you meet one night a week or whether you meet four times a week, that's what you got elected for. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6047.732s">And</a> whatever the issues are, they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6053.556s">Well,</a> being elected never bothered me to go to a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6059.175s">And</a> if it was every week, I went every week. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6061.976s">If</a> it was two or three times a week, we would meet two or three times a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6065.657s">And</a> let me just conclude by saying the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6068.078s">If</a> in fact, this council feels that they now want to change to every other week, please do not put anything on the agenda that asks for pay raise, because you would really be insulting the people of this community.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6087.545s">No,</a> that's not what I said. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6089.486s">What</a> I said is if you're going to make this vote to go to every other week, please don't come back and vote in support of a pay raise for yourself, because then $30,000 for every other week becomes overpaid. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6102.47s">And</a> as Councilor Caraviello alluded to, when he made his comments two weeks ago, if you go to every other week, maybe you should reduce your salary from 30 to 15,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6109.813s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6975.109s">I'm</a> Robert Pentezero, Summit Road, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6977.41s">I</a> believe a couple of weeks ago, this council passed two resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6980.693s">One</a> was a million dollars for new sidewalks, and I believe the second one was for $250,000 to remove tree stumps. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6987.497s">But</a> there was no identification of where the sidewalks were going to go over and beyond money for new panels, and there was no identification as to what tree stumps were going to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6997.404s">Now,</a> over the past few years, here in Medford, former public works director had one, <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7003.688s">two</a> types of lists, one for tree stumps, and one for sidewalks, but unfortunately when the council passed at this time nobody asked that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7011.173s">So</a> as a citizen, the council did ask, they asked a question of where they're going to be located, the tree stumps, and the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7018.778s">So</a> is there any way that that could be made a public disclosure, either on this, we don't have any city newspaper anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7025.623s">So</a> method patch, or in the city web page could that go on there as soon as we get it, we can put it in, we have a dry folder. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7033.088s">Madam</a> President, you say as soon as you get I understand that but you should have had it the night that you took the vote.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7051.887s">But,</a> but is there a list right now that it is available.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7063.536s">So</a> then just a very simple question, not to beg the issue, but maybe it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7067.498s">I</a> mean, you get something to vote on, especially tree stumps, much more than sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7073.803s">Those</a> locations should have identified. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7075.484s">This</a> is the third time something like this has been presented to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7079.207s">So</a> did you get the first two lists? <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7083.51s">I</a> mean, have any of these lists <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7086.187s">tree</a> stumps from the first of the second list even been taken care of some of them with duplicates especially on sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7091.488s">It's</a> just a thought because some residents are saying a million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7094.149s">There's</a> a lot of money for sidewalks.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7128.295s">Is</a> it possible, Madam President, you can just secure a list for both?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7139.461s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7139.741s">Of</a> course. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7140.301s">Okay.</a> <h2><a href="../2024-11-19_kp64eg_WEKE/2024-11-19_kp64eg_WEKE.html">City Council 12-21-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4053.299s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5144.967s">My</a> name is Robert Pantazzo, Summit Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5147.468s">And</a> what subject would you be speaking on, sir? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5149.329s">I'd</a> speak on the Ambulatory Surgical Center up at the location of the Lawrence Memorial Hospital at 170 Governor's Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5159.495s">The</a> reason why I'm bringing this up was after reviewing your city budget and recognizing that you folks set a tax rate this past week, unless I missed it all together, there was no inclusion at all as it related to the amount of money that the new ambulatory service center would be bringing to the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5180.813s">I</a> believe this past, last past Tuesday, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5184.056s">On</a> the 14th of December you folks sat in committee and discuss the tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5189.979s">And</a> I believe, and I could be wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5191.64s">One</a> of the questions that was asked by one of your colleagues Council marked to the assessor as it relates to have you arrived at any kind of a decision regarding the tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5201.606s">at</a> that location 170 Governors Avenue and the assessor responded that they had filed for a tax exempt status. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5210.613s">Conferring</a> upon that and having a brief discussion once again and reaffirming this conversation with Councilor Falco who once again had the same type of concern as related to the assessor's issue of how and what they're going to be taxed. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5225.924s">I</a> think she said that it's charitable or something of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5230.193s">So</a> putting that together, and I just went back and just did a little bit of history on this because I was involved in many of the issues on this particular matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5239.915s">On</a> August 28th of 2018, I sent a certified letter to the State Department of Public Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5245.717s">And</a> one of the components of the letter, it was issued, I issued the regard regarding tax exam status, which up until that point in time had not been mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5255.539s">On</a> September 17th of 2018, in the method transcript, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5259.94s">And</a> headline title future of the lots of oil hostile include community input on this say, but in paragraph number 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5266.688s">I</a> like the existing building, it says the ASC will be a for profit and will therefore pay property taxes to the city of method that came right from them themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5277.841s">October</a> 30 2018 and the city council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5281.803s">It</a> was discussed again as to whether the proposed ASC being a builder and the hospital footprint would pay taxes, would it be by the square footage of the whole Lawrence and will hospital footprint itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5295.564s">November</a> 19 2018 at the council meeting, there was a need for an update for clarification for our city of sex office as to how the SC will be determined for tax purposes if approved by the State Department of Public Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5311.068s">Will</a> it be for the whole Lawrence Memorial Campus to be considered as a for profit, or would it be broken down by the square footage of each building separately. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5320.417s">Again,</a> on November 27 of 2019 Susan Sandberg, then CEO and Vice President of Melrose Wakefield Hospital, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5330.106s">appeared</a> before the city council saying for the first time that the AFC will be a for profit business here in the city of method. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5337.372s">Again</a> in November 2018 I sprinted into the method transcript. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5341.776s">The</a> discussion was once again, a for profit business. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5345.699s">December</a> 6 2018, the method transcript said in the proposed commentary period regarding method officials. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5355.177s">Then</a> in paragraph 13, quote, the proposed method surgery LLC, a joint venture between then named Melrose Wakefield and the Shields Healthcare as being a for-profit taxable ASC. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5368.365s">February</a> 19th, 2019 at a city council meeting, issues were presented as it related to the construction and to the taxing status. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5378.49s">March</a> 19th, 2019, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5381.432s">Melrose</a> Wakefield then notifies the city council and the city that the separate footprint that was going to be at 170 Governors Avenue would now be merged into the property of the Lawrence Memorial Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5393.519s">April</a> 23 2019 the city council meeting, Sue Sandberg said that she was so pleased with the development that have been taking place regarding this proposal taxes will be determined by the city assessor regarding this tax matter, and Michael Max F at the city will be doing a pilot program on the $733,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5415.035s">community</a> health initiative that community health initiative was a planned a planned program for health services within this community and surrounding communities over two to a five year period. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5427.778s">I</a> have not heard one comment by this city, this city administration, or the city assessor's office, as it relates to what is the plan program. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5436.78s">And</a> if in fact it became a pilot program, it was possibly discussed at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5442.021s">May</a> 7 2019 at a committee of the whole meeting once again Council mass ask who, who is going to be paying the taxes on their separate office space, or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5454.591s">The</a> mayor at that time, who was the city council, indicated that she was concerned of a pilot program as it related to just what and how, if we're not going to be getting taxes, if we're going to be involved in a pilot program. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5472.001s">Councilman</a> Fred De La Russa also made comment as he was concerned over how the tax issue was going to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5478.966s">On</a> May 28th, 2019, city council once again <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5483.088s">Vice</a> President Susan Sandberg said the ASC will provide new tax revenue and will provide an additional $750,000 within a two to five year period for additional area services. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5494.854s">She</a> reiterated on May 18, that for which was said on April of that year of the Community Health Service $750,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5503.578s">On</a> June 4, a letter was sent to Susan Sandberg by myself once again, talking about issues as it relates to the taxing issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5511.242s">And</a> then on October 15, 2019, Susan Sandberg reiterated that the ASA will bring tax revenue to the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5521.588s">Also,</a> then-Councilor and then-Mayor Brenna Lundgren stated that she wanted the developer to provide for the city of Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5532.12s">a</a> tax, a tax review number one and number two, the vote will take you can say that the vote that the council is taking that the, the, the agreement would go to the petitioner, not to the land. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5550.164s">When</a> they made their proposal before this method city council into the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5556.145s">Their</a> information presentation read as follows in one of their sections. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5561.147s">What</a> benefits will an ASC bring to the city of Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5564.828s">Their</a> response was the ASC will pay local taxes, as well as add jobs in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5572.411s">In</a> addition, as part of the state revenue process, there will be a substantial community benefits contribution, that's the $750,000 I was talking about, to help address the pressing health and social welfare needs of Medford and other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5588.037s">The</a> total amount the ASC will contribute towards community health initiatives is approximately $733,000, and that'll be paid over a two to five year period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5600.053s">From</a> that period of time, from May 7 of 2015, that can be the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5605.894s">And</a> I believe you had at that point in time made reference to Councilor Falco as it relates to that particular meeting, as it relates to how taxes were going to be paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5615.776s">This</a> city council has not been advised, never mind the council, the taxpayers have not been advised as just how and when it's going to take place for taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5625.17s">And</a> how are they going to pay it and when are they going to play it, and what meetings if anything has taken place at that meeting in May of 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5632.497s">I</a> also presented before there before the city assessor communities such as Weymouth, and then the central hospital and what they were doing with their cities and towns in combination of either a and in lieu of taxes or a tax payment to be made. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5649.833s">You</a> have received nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5651.66s">Nothing</a> has come back, Mr. President, as it relates to this particular issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5656.533s">I</a> secured from the Secretary of State and the State Attorney General's Office, there was no filing of any sorts, other than the amendment that they filed in 12-4-2020, which was December 4th, of a change of address. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5672.643s">They</a> had the original address in Boston, and now they changed it to 170. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5677.426s">Now,</a> just because they're built at 170, 170 Governors Avenue, same address as the Lowell Memorial Hospital, where urgent care is there right now, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5686.112s">There</a> should be no taking advantage of that being a tax exempt nonprofit. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5691.033s">When</a> she was came in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5693.254s">They</a> made it perfectly clear that the linchpin to this deal was that they would pay taxes to the city method on the ASC 16,000 square foot piece of building that they were building for $17,500,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5708.327s">It's</a> a shame that during this budgetary process, when you were setting and addressing your tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5715.429s">Nothing</a> was presented as it relates to the anticipation of approximately any wisdom, five and a half million plus dollars on an annual assessment of that piece of property, what that would bring in for taxes here to the city of medicine. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5731.452s">But</a> before this council gets going again in January next year that this issue is brought to your attention we've heard all kinds of rumors oh yeah they're going to pay, whatever it might have been, you have nothing from the assessor's office in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5744.688s">That's</a> saying number one, they're going to pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5747.371s">You</a> don't have anything regarding the community health portion of $755,000, that's going to be paid over to a five year period of time for the health initiatives and concerns that you might have to be brought forward, and that was brought to the state's Department of Public Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5763.216s">When</a> this was all presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5764.277s">This</a> is a real concern that I have I'm very concerned over this because <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5768.638s">That's</a> hundreds and thousands of dollars that potentially could belong to the city of method coffers that could be used, whether it's in our public health department, our schools our budgets police fire, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5778.964s">This</a> is too small of a thought to be issue when in fact it's a big issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5784.547s">And</a> to me it's such a big issue that it hasn't been discussed, I say shame on everyone who knows what that should have been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5792.832s">This</a> should not be a red herring coming up now to say okay why are we talking about we're talking about now because nobody in the city has talked about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5800.439s">And</a> if somebody made a mistake in their commentary that that's it's for profit will then so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5806.183s">If</a> it's a for profit, not enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5809.126s">If</a> it is for a for profit business, excuse me, you people should have this information. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5815.411s">We</a> the taxpayers should have that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5818.577s">I</a> don't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5819.258s">Is</a> anyone behind this real received anything.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5836.495s">So</a> let me ask you this, Mr. President, directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5838.617s">You</a> had a conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5839.618s">Do</a> you have anything in writing from them that says that? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5841.159s">If</a> you want something in writing, I will get something in writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5843.221s">I</a> think the council deserves it, and I think your tax base and your tax rate deserves it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5847.884s">I</a> will have something in writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5849.546s">I</a> would strongly suggest that a council resolution go forward seeking that, and that nailing it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5854.65s">And</a> for further information, Sue Sandberg is no longer with Melrose-Wakefield.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11114.927s">Well,</a> excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11116.728s">I</a> didn't realize you're gonna allow folks from the audience. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11120.75s">We're</a> here with someone from 1892. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11125.012s">Great</a> service, Mr. Delato, 1892. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11126.632s">He</a> looks the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11128.953s">I</a> don't know what the pill is that he's taking. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11130.574s">It's</a> probably not the blue pill, but that's neither here or there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11134.783s">When</a> I look at these two gentlemen here, I don't know John Falco as well as I do Michael Marx, but I will tell you this, going back to when John Falco was first running for school committee, I met with him and my wife at a restaurant at Mystic Avenue, and he was gracious enough to listen to her concerns being a school teacher as to what possibly could be things that he could bring forward to the school department for which he did. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11158.714s">And</a> I appreciate that and I commend them for taking the opportunity for run for higher office this past year, because it takes an awful lot for someone to give up something that you might have as a security position, which would be a council school committee seat to take the next step forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11173.631s">But</a> if you don't try and never know. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11174.993s">As</a> far as Michael Max goes all I can say. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11180.386s">I</a> wish he was here a little bit longer because I think he probably would have given me the one last incentive to once again run for this August party only for one reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11190.934s">This</a> city is going through a tremendous, like the country, a tremendous amount of change and you do need some level-headed people to understand yesterday, to capitalize what's going to take place for today. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11203.203s">I</a> just hope and wish that this new incoming council can put together <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11209.553s">with</a> the fellows that are here for a few years, some wisdom and common sense that recognizes that we are the city of method, and as an as inclusive as we are, we should not be divisive at the same time, because it cannot work and you cannot sustain itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11226.359s">I</a> thank you, Michael for your years of service your dedication. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11229.722s">But</a> more importantly, I thank your family for allowing you to do it like my family allowed me to do mine for 36 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11236.747s">I</a> appreciate it and I know your folks and your families appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11241.009s">I</a> just hope that the incoming city council grasps the knowledge that needs to be taken to make this city work to go forward and to be able to question <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11251.796s">without</a> having to be called divisive rather than not divisive. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11257.6s">Asking</a> a question to get an answer is the best way to resolve an issue rather than not listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11264.184s">Because</a> I think it was you, John Scott that says, you listen and you listen. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11268.126s">And</a> the more you listen, the more you can learn. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11271.028s">Merry</a> Christmas, happy, healthy new year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11273.51s">And</a> congratulations, John and Michael. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11276.027s">You're</a> welcome.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_BW-5g1WATfg/2024-11-19_BW-5g1WATfg.html">City Council 10-05-21</a></h2>

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=463.132s">Good</a> evening, my name is Bob Penta, Zero Summit Road, former member of the Sarkis party. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=467.496s">I</a> would respectfully disagree with using the word concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=470.279s">The</a> fact of the matter is that an accident has already taken place. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=472.921s">Tank</a> has already been going down that road and coming up that road. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=476.184s">You</a> have MBTA buses telling you, you have a line from your own traffic consultant that tells you that a fire truck, if has to, can go on the opposite lane. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=486.073s">You</a> have no idea at what time of day or night that that might be happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=489.436s">The</a> whole idea, I believe, the impetus of the council president's resolution is to let this city administration know that this council is not supportive of this type of islands coming in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=503.304s">You</a> can call it part of the complete streets program, the $563,000 that the city got from the commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=509.888s">Where</a> was the fire chief being consulted on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=512.33s">Where</a> was the city engineer being consulted? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=514.251s">And</a> all these proposed bump outs that are being planned right now, continuing down on High Street, going into the West Medford area, where's the consultation for that? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=523.599s">Just</a> go look at Sagamore Avenue and see the way they want to have that cutout coming out into the middle of High Street and then Boston Avenue over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=531.064s">And</a> then further down, right opposite the Brooks School, there's a gentleman who just did his driveway over and he's got a bump out in front of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=536.308s">It</a> doesn't make any sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=538.49s">I</a> would not change one word in the president's resolution, only for one reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=542.311s">The</a> city administration has to know that you do recognize that this is a safety problem here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=548.192s">This</a> isn't just for cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=549.753s">This</a> is for trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=550.873s">This</a> is for ambulances. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=552.273s">This</a> is for other kinds of vehicles that are heavy duty going down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=556.334s">And</a> we're not talking about a good day, as the council just alluded to on Sunday at 9 o'clock in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=561.795s">The</a> gentleman, unfortunately, didn't see the island. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=564.376s">Not</a> only didn't see the island, he wrecked the whole bottom of the carriage of his car. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=568.738s">What</a> are you going to do in a snowstorm when it's dark out late at night and you have a big heavy tanker going down there? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=575.046s">What</a> are you going to do with a bicycle, a gentleman or a lady driving their bike down there, going in that little lane there, and you have an emergency vehicle trying to get by? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=585.42s">You</a> know, one thing I learned after many years of being on this council is one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=590.962s">If</a> you know you see something that's wrong, why would you want to just smooth it over, use the word of concern as relates to telling the city administration, you're going to continue on with this complete streets program, this traffic calming issue, then the public safety is the priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=608.887s">And</a> right now it's quite obvious that it's not a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=611.547s">Correct</a> me if I'm wrong, Council President, <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=613.828s">Fire</a> Chief said, even though he can get by, he's only got a foot on either side. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=617.818s">Is</a> that what he said?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=653.904s">I</a> would believe that the impetus of the resolution, if you want to get to the concern that Mr. Isaac Beers has introduced, that would be something that they would once again look at to come back, okay, we'll redesign it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=667.652s">But</a> you'd lose your impact by putting the city on notice that you've recognized, you've talked, this is four times in a month, you have discussed this issue and it's not going away. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=679.152s">And</a> the only way it's going to go away is if the city administration is aware of it and whoever their contact is with the state for the purposes of trying to make this correction, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=688.674s">As</a> of this Sunday, the fire chief, as of this Sunday, the fire chief still hasn't been informed. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=693.175s">So</a> he had to go out there and do his dry run. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=695.555s">Well,</a> how do you call that progress? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=697.916s">How</a> do you call that when somebody is supposed to sit down and let's talk about this traffic calming issue? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=703.837s">How</a> can it be traffic calming when you haven't even spoken to the public safety personnel who it's going to affect? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=710.559s">You</a> know, it isn't like you guys, young lady, are in a tough bind. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=716.882s">It's</a> a very simple resolution that the President has offered. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=723.225s">as</a> the mayor of this community and to your departments, we're putting you on notice because God forbid something happens and somebody gets killed, this council has put the city on notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=733.328s">If</a> not, God forbid something happens and you modify that resolution, you're all gonna be part of a lawsuit. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=740.93s">And</a> then you're gonna have to explain your way out of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=743.651s">That's</a> wrong and that shouldn't happen like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=747.454s">I</a> would suggest, Mr. President, that you do not accept the resolution to modify it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=752.939s">Just</a> make it as a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=754.02s">It's</a> not a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=755.001s">It's</a> an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=755.842s">It's</a> a public safety issue that demands its attention one way or the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=760.987s">And</a> if they don't want to resolve it, shame on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=763.129s">At</a> least the council's on record explaining the reason why. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=766.172s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=768.034s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=770.837s">Chair</a> recognizes Councilor Marks.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1163.281s">Just</a> in response to Council max. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1165.983s">Nobody's</a> asking anything to be redesigned I don't think any of us have that expertise we're aware of that, but nobody came into the city and sat down with the public safety people, as it relates to all these locations that are being promulgated, and whether a review after four months <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1182.35s">I</a> mean, after four weeks talking about this and there's still, there is still no communication with the public safety personnel of this city, which means either one or two things, either the city administration is not listening to the council, the city engineers not listening to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1197.512s">And</a> you have a fire chief who's basically telling you, you might have a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1201.414s">You</a> have a city traffic engineer turns around and tells you, well, if something happens, you can go to the opposite side of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1207.537s">Well,</a> that in and of itself tells you right there, don't talk about public safety when you have a fire truck coming at you on the opposite side of the street, if an emergency exists, or if there's a snowstorm or whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1219.06s">The</a> whole idea I believe of the impotence of this whole resolution is to put the city on notice that you're not happy with the island there because it is, it has the potential to cause problems and if it's going to cause problems in an accident for which you've already had one it's already started. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1233.951s">You</a> know, keep us out of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1235.793s">We</a> should not be part of any lawsuit by any citizen, city of Medford or other city of Medford, because we told you this was going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1243.402s">Maybe</a> it might be wise, Mr. President, to invite the state in to sit down with the city council and review every one of these locations that they want to put in. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1252.032s">How</a> many accidents have taken place? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1253.833s">This</a> is the reason why we're putting it here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1255.774s">Where</a> the bump boats are going and what's the reason for it? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1258.695s">They</a> made the determination. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1260.236s">They</a> don't live in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1262.016s">They're</a> not the experts for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1265.118s">It's</a> our city engineer and our public safety because if it's going to impede anything that they do on a daily basis, they should be primary before any decision is made. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1275.623s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_SxgiOOMwDHY/2024-11-19_SxgiOOMwDHY.html">City Council 06-08-21</a></h2>

<a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5799.655s">Memorial</a> Day was never intended as a celebration to remind us of the ugliness and the ravages of war, but rather to honor in some solemn observance, our men and women, <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5812.54s">their</a> survivors, and our allied comrades who sacrificed their lives to protect our liberty and our freedoms here at home and around the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5823.785s">Likewise,</a> our Flag Day observance on June 14th is but an annual reminder of some 244 years ago when the Second Continental Congress, along with George Washington, took a break from their writing of the Articles of Confederation to establish a standard bearer <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5842.382s">to</a> be the unifying symbol of our colonial fighting forces and for our freedom. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5850.245s">As</a> our fledgling nation was moving forward in its quest for its independence, that is how Old Glory was commissioned to be our American flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5861.143s">From</a> Memorial Day remembrances of lives given up to protect our America, to the flag day birth of old glory, both symbolizing the embodiment of our right of free speech, we are here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5876.69s">But</a> in the interim of many years, what has happened to our country, state, and local cities and towns nationwide, especially over the past 30 years in particular? <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5890.537s">When</a> the politically correct crowd of progressives and liberals began complaining that our public displays of patriotism is offensive to others, and we have to back off such displays, and that we are a systematically racist country as well as a city, and that we need to practice cancel culture, wokeness, defund the police, teach systematic race theory, and being a white supremacist, <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5919.918s">and</a> accept revisionary history as history's new truth, I take offense to such broad universal commentaries, especially by Washington politicians and self-serving proclaimed educators who have made their living by espousing race as their financial and social calling card for more than the past 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5946.933s">With</a> crime running at an all time high, illegal immigration crossing our borders, causing ongoing social welfare, educational, security, and uncontrollable medical problems, we have now become the victims of today's liberal and progressives agenda of inclusion without requirement or responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5973.209s">Also,</a> if God offends anyone, then I suggest you consider another part of the world as your new home, because our good God is part of our American inheritance of religious freedoms secure from governmental intervention. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5989.062s">And</a> if our American stars and stripes offend you, or you do not like or believe in our Uncle Sam, and you don't have the tolerance for free speech, then you should seriously consider exporting yourself to another country. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6004.392s">In</a> conclusion, <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6006.095s">Our</a> First Amendment gives every citizen the right to express his or her opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6011.277s">But</a> for those who complain, whine, or gripe, or dislike our American way of life, as well as our city of Medford way of life, don't let the door slam you as you leave, because you do have the right and the opportunity to leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6030.162s">We</a> are not a perfect society. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6033.805s">but</a> there is no other country that offers more freedoms than our America. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6039.968s">So</a> from a Memorial Day remembrance to a Flag Day observation, let not our freedom of thought, speech, and expression ever be challenged by some ideology that bears no fruit but hatred, division, and racism. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6059.422s">Thank</a> you and let our method never be a part of any such movement or agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6066.267s">I</a> felt Mr. President and Councilors, I had to say that because after being at the Memorial Day service and listening to our veterans director emotionally present before our community that for which a veteran is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6087.122s">I</a> feel as an American. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6091.823s">I</a> am a white Italian American. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6095.306s">I'm</a> proud of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6096.767s">I</a> am not a racist, and I don't intend to be a racist. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6101.191s">I</a> encompass anyone and everyone who wishes to express their opinion, and I would hope that our city of Medford does not go down any path that disrespects the fact of who we are as individuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=6115.943s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8028.474s">Robert</a> Penton, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8031.136s">I</a> have some, Mr. President, this is our third time we've had this discussion on this high street project. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8035.527s">at</a> the corner of Woobin and Hastings Lane. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8039.609s">And</a> I'm a little bit disturbed and recognizing that Mr. Blake, who I've never met, I'm quite sure that he's proficient in what he does, but he makes a comment in his response to you by saying fire trucks may have to use the entire opposite lane to make the turns. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8057.819s">And</a> by doing that, Mr. President, what you are doing, you are exposing the city of Medford to a tremendous amount of liability. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8066.106s">And</a> if the city is going to go forward and leave that island there, then it should be part of the official record here that the Medford City Council does not support, but rather condones the fact that that island can now cause a potential hazard to the city of Medford's liability. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8087.682s">We've</a> spoken to MBTA buses, there's no mention in here on the extra long tankers that carry gas. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8094.305s">The</a> other day coming down high street toward the charter circle, there was a bicyclist there. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8101.329s">And</a> you know those trucks once they have that weight, they're moving. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8105.631s">And</a> he was people in the home because the bike was just taking his time going through that little pathway there. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8112.254s">So</a> all I can say is, <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8114.752s">It's</a> there, it's in writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8116.914s">And</a> the city council now has enough, if you're really strong in this position, and I think you are, you have an affirmative position to make by way of a vote that the city of Medford, the Medford city council opposes that particular island that's put there because the acknowledgement from your own traffic commissioner says, <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8135.872s">The</a> fire trucks might have to go on the complete opposite lane to make its turn. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8140.835s">What</a> about a car coming the opposite way? <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8143.377s">What</a> about the bump out that's over there? <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8145.058s">What</a> about the second island? <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8147.18s">What</a> about the bump out that's in front of the house, in front of the man's driveway, in front of the Brooks School? <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8153.804s">It</a> makes no sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8155.925s">And</a> go further down into West Method on the corner of High Street and Sagamore Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8160.789s">Look</a> what they already have penciled out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8163.571s">It's</a> on to the middle of the street almost. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8166.353s">These</a> aren't traffic calming. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8168.174s">These</a> are traffic accidents just waiting to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8171.115s">And</a> you've got to understand the route traffic and the type of traffic that's on those routes. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8175.958s">I</a> think you brought it up last week, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8178.339s">A</a> truck going up the hill, they've got to pick up the speed to get up the hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8181.86s">Look</a> at the buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8182.741s">What</a> are you going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8184.282s">And</a> right there at that intersection, there's a bump out there, which makes further no sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8189.904s">So</a> I don't know, Mr. Blake. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8191.485s">Like</a> I said, I've never met you and I don't know you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8194.487s">But</a> I don't know how you can put in writing that a firetruck can go in the opposite lane to make its turn if it has to because of an emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8203.774s">You</a> are now indicating that the city is exposing itself to a liability. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8209.659s">And</a> if that's what the state is going to be doing throughout the rest of the city, with these locations, with these prompts, causing problems with side streets because of buses, <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8220.885s">and</a> cars cannot be going down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8222.728s">What</a> are we getting all this money for the state for if the city has no input into providing common sense use of the money? <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8233.145s">It's</a> a damn shame. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8234.899s">that</a> we have to be discussing, you folks have to be discussing something that common sense tells you by just going there and looking at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8242.545s">And</a> you can paint and stripe the streets all you want with your yellow lines, you're not gonna get rid of those islands. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8248.249s">And</a> you're not going to get rid of the fact that coming up or going down in a winter's day storm, and if there's ice in the road, and if there's an emergency that has to take place, somebody is gonna get killed there. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8261.279s">And</a> you already have it now in writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8264.18s">Your</a> traffic supervisor has now told you in writing that a fire truck can go on the opposite lane if he can't make the turn. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8272.283s">What</a> does that tell you? <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8273.423s">What</a> does that tell you about the Commonwealth of Massachusetts coming in here trying to tell the city of Metro, we know what's best for your streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8281.166s">Tell</a> them to take their money back and mind their business and let the city of Metro to its engineering department and through citizen input, take each section one at a time to realize what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8294.052s">It's</a> all right for somebody to come in here and tell you what to do, but it isn't all right for you to tell them, possibly you maybe made a mistake. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8303.038s">You</a> haven't thought this out correctly or possibly. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8306.181s">Mr.</a> President, you're the president of this council, the six of you, you make seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8310.804s">I</a> would strongly, I strongly advise and suggest that some one of you, if not all of you put a resolution on <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8318.851s">indicating</a> that you do not, you are against, and you don't accept the fact that that island in the middle of High Street, Reuben, Hastings Lane, serves in the best interest of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8331.656s">If</a> anything, it does not serve in the best interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8334.897s">And</a> you have the letter from your own traffic supervisor who says the same thing, traffic consultant, excuse me.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_JjIkY7Z2rzw/2024-11-19_JjIkY7Z2rzw.html">City Council 06-01-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3856.492s">Good</a> evening, name and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3857.873s">My</a> name is Bob Penta, former member of the Saugus body. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3860.935s">And</a> I would be remiss not to come up here because as a prior member of the Smith City Council, I think it was only on three separate occasions that I had the honor of recognizing a young gentleman who became an Eagle Scout. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3873.745s">Tonight,</a> it's a distinct pleasure because in today's day and age, you don't even hear of the term of an Eagle Scout. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3879.029s">You</a> don't hear about the dedication that a young man would put <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3883.072s">into</a> doing something positive, not only for the community, but for himself, recognizing he needs to be a success for the future because that's what this is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3893.046s">being</a> self-made and going forward, being a graduate of the vocational school, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3897.507s">Going</a> into the electrical department, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3900.048s">Being</a> an electrician, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3902.389s">But</a> the one thing that everyone seems to be missing today about youngsters, whether they're male or females, is the fact that they have this self-worth of wanting to do something that benefits the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3914.512s">And</a> just by looking at him and looking at the six years that it took him and his family that's here, it's a proud moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3921.114s">And</a> not only is it a proud moment, it speaks well for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3925.311s">You</a> don't hear too much about scouts today in the news. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3927.933s">If</a> anything, you may hear some more negative than positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3930.975s">But</a> this gentleman represents the positive part of what our city is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3936.039s">It</a> represents why Medford is what it is, because they have the ingredients, the intelligence, and the drive of a good, young, honest man who wants to make not only his life better, but our city of Medford better. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3949.57s">So</a> like I said, I would be remiss not to come up here and say that because I think this is <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3954.534s">a</a> distinct honor, not only for this gentleman, but also for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3959.317s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6254.491s">My</a> name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass, former member of the Saugus Party. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6259.976s">Last</a> week, we had an interesting conversation that you started, Mr. President, regarding this little bit of an island that supposedly has found its way at the corner of Woburn and High Street and Hastings Lane. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6271.898s">I</a> spent some time during this past week, once again, speaking to bus drivers, members of our fire department, as it relates to the question that I believe the council asked, and I don't think any of you ever got the answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6285.262s">Whose</a> idea was it to authorize, to put that file in there, in the middle of the street? <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6290.924s">And</a> if you can just anticipate as bus drivers do, and as a fire truck would do, in an emergency, snowstorm, whatever it might be, just take one of those big, <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6300.754s">tankers</a> to deliver gas. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6303.175s">And</a> in the wintertime, if in fact they happen to be coming down the street and there's some ice or whatever it might be, what about the bike people where the bike lane no longer exists anymore and it's not to be found? <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6313.94s">And</a> if they ever decide to put that bike lane in the middle of the street in between the two islands that are there, not the single one, the two islands there, you've got a real serious problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6323.344s">So</a> my question to you, Mr. President, is the city engineers still online?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6343.159s">Is</a> he still online? <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6343.959s">Can</a> we ask the question? <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6345.16s">Um,</a> the traffic engineer is not online. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6347.562s">What</a> about the city engineer? <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6348.863s">I'm</a> quite sure an engineering plan has to take place to put that in. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6354.667s">Unfortunately,</a> he's not online. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6356.58s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, they continue to keep going on and doing work. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6360.702s">If</a> you just take a look at the idea, if in case there's an emergency and a fire truck has to make it down that street and make that left-handed turn in a snowstorm, you have a problem just facing you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6372.008s">You've</a> got a bump out coming out there on the corner of Woolman and High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6376.01s">And</a> it's just, how do you allow things like this to happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6380.012s">I'm</a> not saying the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6381.484s">I</a> would hope that the council would make a concerted effort to have the city stop that process and actually go out there and look at it, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6391.513s">That</a> path coming down on the corner of Hastings, you've seen it, we've talked about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6397.939s">That</a> thing is so narrow, it's an accident waiting to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6401.323s">And</a> is that what the city has to do, wait for the accident to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6404.706s">Correct</a> it before that even happens, and the island should be as a matter of fact they're keeping both islands there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6412.235s">Whoever</a> comes up with bad enough going down high street toward West Midland right near opposite the Brooks School, there's a bumper right in front of somebody's house. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6420.9s">It</a> makes no sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6422.621s">Who</a> comes up with these ideas? <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6424.523s">I</a> mean, it would be nice if you want to talk about public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6427.324s">That's</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6427.965s">It</a> would be nice to maybe have the council think about it or have them involved with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6432.667s">And</a> I don't know if these are state people. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6434.389s">I</a> don't know if these are city contractors or if this is the city itself that's doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6438.531s">But</a> between the bump outs and that section right there, right there on the corner of High Street, Hastings Lane and Rubin Street, that is a disaster waiting to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6447.975s">And</a> I would hope this council takes an aggressive action and holds the city accountable and not continue further with that and get rid of that island. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6455.719s">It</a> just makes no sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6457.279s">You'd</a> have to be a complete moron not to understand coming down High Street, that road is so narrow, <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6464.658s">Just</a> think of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6466.279s">Both</a> ways, both ways, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6469.08s">Both</a> ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6469.901s">And</a> it's a shame that none of you have gotten an answer back and you asked for that a week ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6474.442s">Public</a> safety and not even an answer.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6517.98s">And</a> you've got the bumper right over there as well.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6521.983s">I'm</a> picking up one other point that Council Marks alluded to, because apparently there's been no updating as to the streets, as the sidewalks being a little bit wider in the bike lane. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6531.65s">So</a> since none of that has taken place, and you have people coming down High Street in that bike lane, they're going to traverse right into that middle of maybe 8 to 10 feet wide.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6546.586s">I</a> would hope one of you on this council would make a motion to just put a stop in that project to fully have a complete public safety review.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6556.934s">It's</a> up and it can also be taken down.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6610.339s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6611.26s">I</a> thank you for listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6612.543s">I</a> know you've seen it, we've had this discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6615.225s">And</a> again, I would something, hopefully, you know, things are made to be corrected. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6619.407s">That's</a> why there's a racist on pencils. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6620.968s">And</a> that's why sometimes having something like this really be taken a look at in the interest of public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6627.111s">I</a> think it makes a lot of sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6628.652s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=6629.172s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_7dpVBOZN8pE/2024-11-19_7dpVBOZN8pE.html">City Council 05-25-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1961.812s">Robert</a> Penta, Zero Summit Road, former member of the Saugus body. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1965.595s">During</a> this past week, I've had two conversations with two separate bus drivers from the MBTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1970.44s">And</a> their question is, cause I can't answer it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1972.141s">So</a> since you do have the city engineer online, they think this is a complete hasty comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1978.755s">Safety</a> has it as Councilor Caraviello and a few of you alluded to, to having this island that sticks out on the corner of High Street and Woburn. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1986.619s">So</a> since we have the city engineer, could you please answer the question, whose idea was to put that island there? <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1993.022s">And</a> did that island come in as an afterthought to this construction project? <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1996.944s">Because</a> if that's the case, then I would strongly suggest that you folks recommend that that be removed before someone gets killed here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2005.405s">Can</a> we ask the question, please, to the city engineer?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2055.541s">But</a> with that being said, Mr. President, going back to what Councilor Marks and others have alluded to, the bike lane and the taking a property coming up high street and then getting to that intersection going down the hill, that seems to be have bypassed whatever was supposed to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2070.548s">And</a> you're asking for something now that this council has already voted on and there's been a change. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2076.291s">I</a> get the impression that this council has not been advised of these changes and the bike route. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2082.586s">and</a> the island that went there, because it appears that that island, I mean, you're talking about safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2088.687s">Let's</a> talk about the traffic safety before the, you already have a crosswalk right there at the corner of Hastings Lane going across. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2096.069s">And</a> the island comes out a little bit more, it comes over in the area that's pushed out where, in front of the other island that's already there, that's gonna be gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2103.11s">But</a> you have to take into consideration in the wintertime, buses coming down the street, heavy duty trucks, ambulances that have to get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2110.652s">You're</a> looking at a serious, <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2112.587s">vehicular</a> emergency situation that's going to happen there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2116.991s">So</a> I would strongly suggest that that island can be removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2120.555s">It</a> should be removed.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5900.88s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5902.181s">Mr.</a> President, I'm Bob Pento, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5905.126s">Rick</a> just jogged my mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5906.887s">The</a> city has in its Department of Public Works, anytime a street is opened by a public utility, there is a bond that they have to place. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5914.489s">I</a> believe it's gone from five to $10,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5917.63s">I</a> think what really needs to be checked, if you wanna get into this review as Rick suggested, and he's absolutely right, have those bonds been taken out? <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5925.393s">Is</a> the city sitting on any kind of money in its legal department or the Department of Public Works? <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5930.535s">Because</a> one of the big complaints before when the streets were being dug up by utilities, <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5934.26s">They</a> weren't being put back in the way they were or made better than what they were. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5938.122s">And</a> many streets are like that in the city, national grids coming in, they've done that on numerous occasions. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5942.844s">So</a> as a result of that, I think it's something that you probably should look into. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5946.405s">Have</a> they filed anything by way of a bond with the city as it relates to this? <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5951.267s">And</a> more importantly, when you talk about the residents not getting their fair share out of this whole thing, Councilor Marx is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5958.55s">Because</a> if in that agreement, in that purchase and whatever you want to call it, that agreement between the city and Eversource, it keeps going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5966.716s">And</a> as we know, and I'll ask Councilor Knight, Vice President Knight, if you look at all those additions that they've had since 2015, I guarantee you that the personnel that started this aren't the same personnel that's there right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5980.305s">And</a> if that's the case, that's where the city is losing out. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5983.186s">So</a> that's why you need it hard and fast right up front when the contract is signed, <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5987.714s">Once</a> again, what are they putting up? <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5989.034s">Are</a> they putting up a million or two million? <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5991.035s">Whatever</a> the contingency might be, but you have it right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5994.076s">You</a> have it already built into the Department of Public Works. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5996.737s">When</a> the public utility comes into the city, they have to place a bond. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6000.898s">And</a> if they don't place the bond, they don't get their money back as it relates to the work that they've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6006.239s">And</a> there has to be what they call a performance bond. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6008.857s">And</a> that's the term, performance bond. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6010.519s">And</a> if that's not in the contract and they are digging up the street and Eversource is in fact utility, then shame on the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6017.245s">But</a> if you do have it, then maybe that $10,000 ought to be increased to a million or two because of the magnitude and the scope of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6024.812s">So</a> thank you, Rick Orlando, you jog my memory.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_8uC6Vq145lQ/2024-11-19_8uC6Vq145lQ.html">City Council 05-11-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2114.637s">Robert</a> Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass, former member of the Saugus party. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2119.404s">My</a> recollection of Harrell goes back to the many times, not only him being a police officer, but the many times he stayed involved in his community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2127.136s">He</a> used to come to these council meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2129.098s">on</a> numerous occasions. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2130.139s">And</a> if he had an opinion to make, he would make it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2132.94s">And</a> he would tell you right to your face what he thought of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2134.881s">That's</a> the same way he acted when he was a police officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2137.983s">If</a> he made an infraction of the law, you were guilty of doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2141.344s">And</a> then if he wanted to give you a break, that would be a separate story. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2144.326s">But</a> the interesting part about Harold is I think he represents what a lot of people try to do to a police officer today. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2153.804s">They</a> try to make them look like a bad person. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2156.706s">They're</a> not out there for the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2159.007s">That's</a> the worst message you can send out there right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2162.849s">Harold</a> McGillivray was a policeman's policeman. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2166.611s">And</a> he represents every single policeman that puts that uniform on every day, puts that gun, puts that badge, and goes out there to defend the people of the community that they're in, whether it's city, county, state, or whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2181.099s">I</a> would hope that the people of Medford not only appreciate the fact that Harold McGillivray and the family and his two sons, who are also police officers in the city, are going to have their father's name be put on the plaque that represents what law enforcement is in this country. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2198.276s">They're</a> there to help and defend the people, and that's what it should be about. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2203.544s">not</a> to debunk them, but to defend them. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2206.407s">And</a> it's a shame that anyone tries to do anything to take away from the integrity of what a police officer is. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2212.933s">And</a> to Mr. Harold McGillivray, I thank him very much because I enjoyed him and he was a good supporter of mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2218.819s">And</a> because of that, I support him as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2221.041s">Thank</a> you.

<a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6787.602s">You</a> know, where are we going as a community and as elected officials? <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6791.984s">You</a> know the real sad part about this? <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6794.415s">This</a> is gonna be the 30th year in Washington, D.C. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6798.697s">that</a> the veterans have had their annual motorcycle parade. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6801.939s">And</a> it's the first time that it's being canceled. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6805.321s">It's</a> being canceled because allegedly of COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6808.822s">But</a> on the same day, BLM is having their parade and cannabis is having their event on the same day, same times as the schedule for the AMVETS 30th anniversary motorcycle parade. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6823.795s">There's</a> a little bit of a disconnect here and maybe of a political, where do we go and who is in support of who and whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6830.777s">I'll</a> tell you my experience about my free speech being infringed upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6835.758s">There's</a> a group in Method called Method Mass Politics. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6839.479s">The</a> issue was the Christopher Columbus School. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6842.06s">Now</a> I expressed my opinion on that page, like I've done on many pages here on the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6848.162s">I've</a> been called every conceivable thing that you can think of on that page. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6853.679s">on</a> that group by members in that group and leaving no expert is out. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6859.662s">Just</a> use your imagination. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6862.783s">That's</a> free speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6865.644s">And</a> if they want to say it, and if they're not going to be scolded because of being the appropriateness of their language, then so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6874.108s">But</a> I shouldn't be chastised or anyone else be chastised for going on that page or any other page and expressing your opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6881.571s">Just</a> like Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6882.092s">D'Antonio</a> said, <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6883.4s">just</a> like Councilor Doherty said. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6885.182s">And</a> when you are on a board and a commission of this community, common sense dictates. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6891.248s">Because</a> that's what you're here for, to listen to both sides of whatever the issue might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6896.293s">Common</a> sense dictates. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6897.995s">And</a> unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be working here in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6902.88s">You</a> know what I resent the most? <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6904.804s">I</a> resent the most when people say, I'm white, I was born privileged, and I have a spoon in my mouth, and I can take advantage of anything, or I have taken advantage of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6916.123s">When</a> I look at all of you, you're all white, okay?

<a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7000.111s">You</a> people should have a committee of the whole meeting with the mayor present to tell you how this money is going to be disseminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7006.933s">In</a> 2007 and 2009, when this country had its economic problems, the monies that were given out back then couldn't compete against the needs that the communities have. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7016.836s">Well,</a> now it's a little bit different. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7019.116s">We're</a> getting $37 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7020.717s">It's</a> a tremendous amount of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7022.937s">But</a> you got to look at some of the things that can be used for. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7025.859s">And</a> to me, the first question is, it's looming right around the corner from all of you in 2029, you've got an approximately $30 million unfunded pension liability that no one still talks about. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7038.248s">Who's</a> gonna pay for that? <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7039.209s">How's</a> it gonna be paid? <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7040.33s">Is</a> it gonna be included in this money that you're going to be getting? <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7043.733s">These</a> are questions you really need to ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7046.054s">Also,</a> it talks about paying premium pay for the people who did work during the COVID-19. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7054.24s">Well,</a> how are you going to disseminate that? <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7055.861s">Is</a> it going to be first responders? <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7057.342s">Is</a> it going to be fire? <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7058.142s">Is</a> it going to be police? <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7059.583s">Who's</a> it going to be? <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7061.284s">I</a> think you really need to sit down and have this conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7064.766s">Let</a> me ask you, have you people have been notified already that you're getting $37 million or did you just read about it in the paper? <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7072.39s">You</a> know, Mr. President?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7075.072s">You</a> have not received it, but it's okay for transparency, for the patch to have it, but the council not to have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7082.275s">My</a> suggestion strongly to folks, all of you, whether you're sitting here or the two that are sitting home, that you sit down with the mayor and her staff to discuss what that $37,500,000 is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7095.559s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7150.169s">Through</a> the chair, Mr. President, it also indicates that you can get premium pay for essential workers and you can offer additional support. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7156.493s">And</a> you can also, the money can also go into the educational park and the educational park for which a lot of these kids have gone through, they have suffered over the past year for emotional disabilities that kids have been able to suffer. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7168.872s">and</a> we won't get it to the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7170.032s">We'll</a> just leave it like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7172.773s">There</a> is money there. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7173.794s">It's</a> broken down. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7174.534s">There's</a> six categories. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7176.235s">I'm</a> not gonna go through all six of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7177.435s">I'm</a> just saying, thank you, Council Vice President Knight, but I think you really need to sit down. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7182.257s">And</a> before you take one vote on this budget coming up, you should know exactly how and when that money's coming in and what it can be used for. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7189.6s">And</a> just as a third point, let's go back to the money that they wanna use to take the $500,000 out of that retained earnings account. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7198.946s">We</a> are well beyond the 10 year, 10 to 12 year minimum. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7203.395s">We're</a> into almost the 15th year. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7205.372s">We</a> have batteries. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7207.033s">Batteries</a> are not calculating properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7209.055s">And</a> that's going to reflect on people's bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7210.997s">And</a> that's going to be, it was 795 abatements.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7217.963s">No,</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7219.003s">No,</a> listen, wait a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7220.204s">We're</a> talking about money. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7221.165s">We're</a> coming close to our 10 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7222.586s">I'm</a> sorry, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7223.948s">It</a> does talk about money that can be used for infrastructure and water and sewer and water and sewer.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7230.613s">And</a> water and soil. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7231.735s">This</a> is public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7233.376s">It's</a> my right to say my free speech, and it's my time to say what I want to say, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7239.483s">Okay,</a> that's the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7241.084s">Don't</a> shut somebody off if they're making a point.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7308.401s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7308.962s">Mr.</a> President, with all due respect to the unfunded liability, if you look at the budget for the last four years, it's not been funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7315.843s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_GswFX5Excbs/2024-11-19_GswFX5Excbs.html">City Council 04-27-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4015.304s">Good</a> evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4016.144s">Robert</a> Penta, Zero Summit Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4017.645s">I'm</a> a member of the Society of Sprite. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4019.848s">I</a> want to go back to the December of 2002. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4022.61s">And</a> at that point in time, there was a gentleman by the name of Donald Ouellette, who became the city engineer here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4031.658s">And</a> one of the reasons why he became the new city engineer is because he came from the community of Air Mass, where he instituted a new water metering program. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4042.567s">At</a> the time, Paul Guia was our director of public works. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4046.37s">And</a> in December of 2002, <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4048.535s">Mr.</a> Roulette came on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4051.176s">In</a> January 20th of 2003, Councilor Marks and myself at the time were interviewed by the local newspaper for the purposes of the concerns that were out in the neighborhood regarding the water meter and the bills that were going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4067.242s">And</a> at that point in time, information came forward that for the past three years, prior to 2003, there were over 709 abatements <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4077.335s">that</a> were issued by the city of Medford because of faulty water meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4082.259s">Mr.</a> Roulette, when he came in, indicated that the city of Medford's water meters at that time were no more, they should be no more than 10 years of age. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4091.225s">They</a> were 17 years old at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4095.208s">So</a> that began the crusade, so to speak, of figuring out how are we going to change these water meters? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4102.013s">Should</a> we change these water meters? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4103.534s">And</a> when are we going to do it? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4105.687s">At</a> the time, there was over 15,000 households that had water meters that needed to be changed, as well as 150 large capacity commercial district people, which represented 50% of the water consumption and the use at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4123.961s">Now,</a> in August of 2003, the concerns kept multiplying on the council from residents complaining about their tax bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4134.294s">And</a> October 23rd, in a very rare moment by former Mayor McGlynn, he acknowledged at a public meeting that it was his fault that the meters were not changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4144.72s">And</a> the reason is the concern wasn't as bad as it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4148.502s">And</a> he told the Water and Soil Commission at that point in time that blame me, that was his quote, blame me because they just didn't want to get into the financial obligation of getting into the water meters, not realizing how serious everything was. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4161.809s">And</a> that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4163.279s">because</a> that got itself corrected after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4166.241s">Then</a> on February 17 of 2004, Mayor McGlynn presented before the city council a prelude, a prelude so to speak as to what the water meter sewer count should look like and what do we need to do here to go in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4183.255s">But</a> what he did and what he proposed, which was kind of interesting, he proposed to finance $18,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4189.402s">have</a> the city council vote for $18,000 to do a preliminary review on X amount of homes and X amount of businesses in the city, just to see how bad these water meters were in commercial meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4201.666s">And</a> what they found out was an atrocious, the decision or the results were atrocious, because what came out of all of that, where these meters were running much slower, and as a result of them running much slower, the city was losing a tremendous amount of revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4215.75s">So</a> in October of 2004, <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4219.526s">straight</a> down October 19th, the city council voted the appropriation for $4.2 million to put new water meters here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4228.13s">And</a> subsequent to that, the chase goes on. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4231.272s">At</a> that point in time, and that's back in 2003, at the end of 2003, the city of Medford was losing on a daily basis 189 million gallons of water a day, not getting billed, and their leakage was 113 million gallons a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4248.325s">Those</a> two numbers, and I would hope somebody in the council would pick up on that and make a request as to what our leakage is and loss of revenue from then it is now. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4258.407s">The</a> new water meters that came in, once again, had a 10 year lifespan and the meters on this new meeting system, they had batteries in their battery life, according to their own information that they passed up as a 10 year life. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4275.433s">We've</a> well exceeded a 10 year life on these batteries. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4279.515s">I</a> believe most recently there have been some concerns with people who have gotten their bills and their bills have been higher or lower than expected than what they received in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4291.819s">I</a> really think as the concern is for parking in the city, the concern should equally be as where are we going? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4298.141s">You're</a> sitting on over $5 million in your water and sewer enterprise account. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4302.043s">There</a> needs to be some addressing to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4303.743s">When</a> is it going to take place? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4305.988s">And</a> if it's, if in fact, they're accurate in their information that they submitted and they gave us at the time when the council voted on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4314.633s">I</a> think council Max was the only one on the council at the time when we voted on this, something really needs to be done because you're gonna find yourself right back to where you were before. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4323.879s">If</a> in fact, 10 years is the mandate as their brochure says. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4329.262s">So</a> with that being said, I would hope somewhere along the line, what a 10 year battery and a 10 year life of the meter <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4335.555s">something</a> needs to be looked at because we're going to find ourselves right back into the same problem that we were when they were 17 years of age and you brought in a new person. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4344.78s">Second</a> comment, Mr. President, I think it was three weeks ago when I appeared before here, when they were talking about the 5G situation, I said at that point in time that I believed, I believed, and it's my mistake, I misquoted myself, <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4359.93s">I</a> believe that that time that one of the people who happens to be the director of public, what's her name? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4366.774s">Public</a> health at that point in time had voted for some of the passing and not for passing some of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4374.519s">Sort</a> of like split down the middle. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4376.36s">I</a> want to thank council Max. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4377.641s">I</a> want to compliment him because of his institution of pushing forward the folks that had their place, not have that 5G go in front of their house. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4390.984s">at</a> their last meeting, I think that sets the tempo for people to stand up and say, hey, you can fight the government and you can push them back if you have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4398.83s">They've</a> set the standard now. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4400.832s">And</a> people out there, if you don't want that 5G in front of your house, now's your time to complain because they've already set the trademark. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4406.917s">And</a> the council, I believe the vote was four to nothing on that particular issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4413.262s">Two</a> last comments, and they go like this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4416.125s">The</a> two gentlemen that you just talked about, Tom Kianciano and Bob McGovern, <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4420.21s">I</a> think the underlying issue there to their lives are that they were born and bred in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4426.836s">True</a> Medford family folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4429.899s">Something</a> that's very hard to understand today for people who just move in here, who think that even though they've been here for 10 to 15 years, they know Medford like somebody in their family who's lived here their whole life, who's been well respected within the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4445.132s">They</a> both happen to have a Wellington background. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4448.135s">And</a> they both happen to have a big family background, something that's hard to find today and to be respected for and to. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4455.678s">So</a> with that being said, I congratulate you for bringing the issue of dedicating the meeting on their behalf. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4461.581s">And</a> I think it's a true honor. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4463.962s">I</a> think also would be a true honor for this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4466.962s">You're</a> getting ready to deal with your budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4468.483s">It's</a> coming up pretty soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4470.184s">This</a> is a big issue as far as I'm concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4472.144s">If</a> I was running for office right now, I would be running to find out where are and is the money for these meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4479.088s">Do</a> they have to be replaced? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4480.348s">When</a> are they going to be replaced? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4482.129s">And</a> how and where is the money going to be found? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4484.13s">Are</a> they going to take it out of the Water and Sewer Enterprise account or what have you? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4488.712s">This</a> is serious money and this is serious community money. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4492.294s">And</a> let me just leave you with one last thought, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4494.194s">I'd</a> like to ask you a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4495.72s">because</a> I look forward to every Tuesday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4498.002s">You</a> started this about three or four weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4500.324s">I</a> don't hear any more from the director of public health on an update as to what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4504.948s">And</a> is there a reason for that?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4515.277s">But</a> if I remember correctly, the one week she couldn't come, she gave you a written synopsis. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4519.46s">I</a> haven't heard, I haven't heard anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4521.96s">because</a> people look forward to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4523.22s">So</a> I would just hope maybe, you know, that gets itself reinstituted. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4526.901s">But</a> as far as just getting back real quick on the water meters and the whole idea of the meters, it's going to turn out to be a big issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4534.722s">It's</a> going to be a financial concern for this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4536.703s">And</a> I'm quite sure when council Marks and myself at that point in time in 2003, we viewed 709 abatements having been filed because the meters were not cooperating correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4550.485s">And</a> thankfully, Mayor McGlynn finally understood. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4552.527s">And</a> that's the reason why he put the appropriation in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4555.268s">You</a> don't want to get yourself into that position again right now, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4559.111s">I</a> don't think it will serve you any good. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4561.413s">So</a> I have all the records here of everything that took place, how we got to where we got at that point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4568.658s">So</a> I would hope that the council does not find themselves in that same position again. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4572.741s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Speaker. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=4573.642s">You're</a> welcome.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5226.179s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5226.319s">Mr.</a> President, just one quick, Council Marks and Council Falco are both correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5231.94s">The</a> software that the city was supposed to purchase would cost anywhere between 100 and 115,000 at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5238.501s">And</a> they figured that the reason that they would save the money on that is just think about all the abatements that you would not have to service, the people that would have to leave work or whatever it might be to come to a hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5248.242s">And</a> sometimes if they didn't even win on their abatement process, they'd have to take that to the <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5252.853s">district</a> go over and some of them, but Councilor Falco is absolutely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5257.475s">The</a> way the program was sold is you were going to have an abatement. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5261.037s">You</a> were going to have a program with a software. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5263.598s">And</a> if any house spiked irregularly, they would contact the taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5268.301s">It</a> should not be the taxpayer contacting the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5271.342s">And</a> I think that's the key. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5273.764s">That</a> was the key as Councilor Markswell alluded to and Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5277.446s">And</a> it's just, you know, when you say out of sight out of mind, but that's not right either. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5282.689s">It's</a> the biggest, other than doing a public works street or a sidewalk, it's the biggest financial obligation that the city has to its taxpayers as it relates to make sure that the water and sewer system works properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5297.121s">And</a> if it's not working properly and there is something wrong with the infrastructure below the street, below the sidewalk, how's the taxpayer gonna know? <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5304.987s">When</a> in fact you're collecting, you're raising the taxes each and every year, you're raising the rates each and every year, <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5310.664s">You</a> supposedly have this system and you're still telling the taxpayer, you've got to call city hall to find out what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5317.209s">That</a> doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=5318.41s">So</a> I think you get your work cut off.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_6Dwt4KXgHTk/2024-11-19_6Dwt4KXgHTk.html">City Council 04-13-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11502.76s">The</a> mic isn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11504.081s">Bob</a> Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11506.782s">Mr.</a> President, I appreciate the fact that this is an ongoing thing, and I want to compliment Councilor Marks <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11512.329s">because</a> speaking throughout the community, he has taken the charge on this particular issue, not to be for or against, but just to bring the awareness and to have some understanding of a communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11523.492s">As</a> I said before, this is a $5 billion G5 undertaking by Verizon. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11529.913s">And</a> some two years ago, when they first came into the city and had a discussion on this, they allegedly stated there was 143 locations or 143 polls <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11539.053s">that</a> they had identified here in the city of Medford as to where they were gonna go. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11542.796s">Now,</a> these poles are all owned by National Grid and on National Grid's poles, you have fire, you have police, you have alarm systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11550.541s">They're</a> all pole renters and they pay National Grid to be on those poles. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11556.185s">And</a> by paying National Grid to be on those poles, National Grid is now receiving a financial inducement, so to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11566.468s">In</a> return, that inducement doesn't find itself anywhere back to the rate payers of National Grid, but all Verizon is doing is getting more and more profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11576.754s">And</a> they're not spending $5 billion just for the sake of having $5 billion to spend, because the subscribers to Verizon plans are gonna pay for that in the long run. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11586.159s">There's</a> been no explanation as between 4G to 5G, whether there's anything medically or substantially different, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11594.226s">that</a> could possibly hurt somebody because of the medical portions of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11598.448s">So</a> the question then becomes, and alluding back to council Marx's comment, if you have the lady who is a board of health director, who sits on this board of four, which makes no sense at all, but who sits on this board of four, you've had 11 votes so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11613.676s">And</a> of those 11 votes, six of them have been against and five of them had been for. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11619.983s">Now,</a> I would strongly suggest that you would ask, some one of you folks, ask a question of why the people voted the way they did. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11628.165s">Because</a> if you understood last week, there was two young ladies here from a certain part of Medford who was concerned about a poll being in front of their house and the poll being in front of their house, not wanting it there, not knowing what the 5G could admit. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11641.748s">So</a> of the five that got approved as compared to the six that didn't get approved, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11646.181s">Do</a> the six have an argument against the five or does the five have an argument against the six? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11650.363s">Are</a> we going to play what kind of game is this going to turn out to be? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11653.884s">Who</a> gets it and who doesn't get it? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11655.625s">It's</a> not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11656.966s">But</a> the most important thing that I think is missing here that the mayor of this community, having this committee being sent up should have made some kind of an agreement with Verizon as to what the city of Medford is going to get in return <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11669.793s">for</a> having Verizon come into this city and go from 4G to 5G, because the only one right now that's going to be making all the money up front is going to be National Grid on the poles. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11678.997s">And</a> Verizon in the long run will get this, whether it goes to 5G, 6G, 7G, who knows, that's not the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11684.88s">The</a> fact of the matter is they're here, they were planning for it as of two years ago, whether it's 143 poles or 143 locations, that seems to be the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11694.344s">So</a> if you're going to have this meeting, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11696.345s">this</a> meeting, however this meeting is going to be sent up, what's the logic? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11700.267s">What's</a> the reasoning behind approval and disapproval? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11704.028s">And</a> if the director of public health voted against it, and even if it was because she felt that it wasn't right for the city, then it's not right for the city all the time, not just part of the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11715.913s">And</a> those people that voted for it, as compared to the six times they didn't vote for it, well, what was their logic to it? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11722.569s">And</a> I think it's very important that if they're going to make a decision, and you said there's 11 requirements on there, then those 11 requirements have to be met by all applicants that come, all 42 applicants. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11734.674s">So</a> if that's being said, there's no logic, there's no rhyme or reason right now to the 11 decisions that have been made thus far, six for, six against, and five for. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11744.459s">How</a> do you justify that? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11745.619s">How</a> do you explain to the city that you have this committee of ongoing people with no experts on there <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11752.674s">That</a> doesn't make any sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11754.217s">And</a> when the taxpayers can ask that question, you have this subcommittee that's not even odd number, it's even. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11762.83s">and</a> you're being restricted according to FCC that you can't vote because of any medical concerns, but you have your own director of public health on the committee and she votes against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11774.722s">Well,</a> what's her logic for voting against it? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11777.505s">What</a> are all the other members who voted against it? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11780.348s">What</a> was their logic? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11781.649s">And</a> what was the logic of the five that got approved? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11784.953s">That's</a> important to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11786.795s">because</a> you're going to play playing this game with 40 somewhat applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11790.477s">Some</a> get it, some don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11792.217s">Some</a> streets get it, some don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11794.058s">One</a> house has it, another one doesn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11795.799s">And</a> what are you going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11797.26s">Wind</a> up having a lawsuit between people in the city saying, hey, how can you give it to one and not another? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11802.622s">I</a> didn't want it there, but you let it be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11804.983s">That's</a> a good suggestion you came up with, Councilor Marks, because if somebody wants to come and put a poll in a particular area, then maybe they should <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11812.102s">come</a> in advance, say this is where we'd like to do it, and get a find out, let's find out if people are for it or against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11819.106s">But</a> the one thing you forgot to mention on whether it's Burlington or Cambridge, they've got a committee, they've got a committee that's uniform, either it's for or against, it's not split. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11829.872s">So</a> you're dealing with a subcommittee or whatever you want to call this committee, that's split, you have no professionals, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11836.445s">No</a> medical experts, you definitely don't have any technical experts. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11840.026s">And</a> with that being said, how can anybody trust that whether 5G is better than 4G, medically or otherwise, it doesn't exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11848.369s">But</a> this city is allowing a multi-billion dollar corporation to come in and right now, nobody knows if the city of Medford is getting anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11858.172s">Nobody</a> knows if this mayor has made any kind of an agreement with Verizon to come in here and do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11863.354s">And</a> the only ones that are gonna get rich in the long run <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11866.596s">is</a> going to be rising in the long run and national grid up front, and your rates aren't going to go down. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11872.002s">So</a> what have you accomplished? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11873.804s">Or</a> better yet, you've allowed somebody to come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11877.067s">This</a> is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11877.728s">You</a> should have this meeting with that subcommittee, with the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11881.852s">with</a> the legal counsel that you have, and you should bring in a medical and you should bring in a legal expert. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11886.257s">Doesn't</a> make any difference if FCC rules and regulations say you can't vote on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11890.14s">You</a> have a determination because if the person that's on the committee is medically entitled with the knowledge to know that the 5Gs <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11898.032s">will</a> not work in behalf of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11899.872s">You</a> can't pick and choose what part of the city you want it to go in. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11902.893s">It</a> either is or it isn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11904.533s">Your</a> technical person will say either it is or it isn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11907.454s">You</a> can't go from 4G to 5G. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11909.575s">Where's</a> your expert to tell you what's the difference between the two? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11912.355s">That</a> hasn't even come out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11915.216s">Oh,</a> I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11916.176s">That</a> hasn't even come out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11918.457s">These</a> are important questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11919.677s">So</a> they've already voted on 11 applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11923.478s">It</a> doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11925.438s">You</a> can't run a professional business on something such as this and then be left out in the cold. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11931.404s">And</a> here are seven of you trying to ask questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11933.806s">You</a> have one city council who took the bull by the horns and the people appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11939.251s">And</a> I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11940.112s">And</a> I think all seven of you appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11942.474s">But</a> the fact of the matter is one simple question. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11946.418s">Who's</a> running the show here, Verizon? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11949.909s">You</a> don't know, they seem to be running the show. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11952.271s">Is</a> it National Grid? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11953.272s">Because</a> it's their poll. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11954.933s">They're</a> allowing to go up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11956.494s">They're</a> allowing renters to go up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11958.836s">You</a> don't have any verification from anybody in the city, from the mayor down, where that transparency is, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11965.121s">It</a> needs to come out, it needs to be found. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11969.524s">And</a> if this continues to go on like this, and you folks know me, and that four member committee just keeps going on, and they make those approvals, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11976.758s">Well,</a> then shame on the people of Medford for electing the administration that has allowed this to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11983.343s">You</a> city council have at least taken your position. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11986.325s">But</a> there's a transparency issue here that needs to come forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11989.428s">And</a> it has yet to come forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11991.109s">And</a> because of that, somebody is going to have to pay the price for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=11994.652s">And</a> hopefully, the 5G doesn't go into neighborhoods where people subsequently medically find out that there was something wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12002.691s">You</a> don't want to find yourself into like a Johnson and Johnson situation that just came up now with the federal government because people now have a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12010.335s">There's</a> been some bad reactions to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12012.396s">Does</a> that mean that they're all bad? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12013.677s">No,</a> it doesn't mean that they're all that they're bad, but you've got plenty of time to test this thing out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12017.999s">If</a> they've been here two years ago, since 2019 and saying that we're going to have 143 locations, and this is now 2021, something is wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12027.524s">If</a> there's been no situation, no communication, I would respectfully ask that one of you <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12032.851s">ask</a> the city administration, the mayor's office, what, if anything, is the city of Medford going to get, or is the city of Medford getting, by allowing Verizon to come in and put 5G on these poles? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12045.603s">It's</a> a money matter, follow the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12047.605s">It's</a> all about money, as we all know. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12050.007s">$5</a> billion is not chump change. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12052.469s">It's</a> a huge investment nationwide. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12054.972s">And</a> when T-Mobile can rent off the same pole <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12058.922s">that</a> Verizon is putting up, you know, they're all making money. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12063.545s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_0CWldZ_RYd4/2024-11-19_0CWldZ_RYd4.html">City Council 04-06-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=6521.308s">Mr.</a> President, I would like to, if the young lady felt insulted, I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=6527.232s">But</a> that's the marketing that Verizon does when they go out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=6530.955s">They</a> go to the lowest socioeconomic areas because that's the ones that they feel that they can move into first. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=6538.62s">That's</a> what I said.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_ilBXW43EmQ8/2024-11-19_ilBXW43EmQ8.html">City Council 03-30-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4027.53s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4028.17s">As</a> a matter of fact, Mr. President, I'm picking up on your resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4032.483s">that</a> took place in 2016, because at that time it was the second year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4037.987s">And</a> I believe along with you and Councilor Knight and then Councilor Brianna Longo, there was some concerns with Park Method and their distribution of how the revenue was going to be coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4049.214s">Therefore,</a> as a result of that, what we needed to go to, as I indicated back then, was to go to the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4057.079s">And</a> in the contract on page five, there is two specific sections. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4060.921s">It</a> basically includes <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4062.722s">that</a> states 20 days after the end of each month, a monthly report would be submitted to the city of Medford as it relates to a whole host of issues relative to the inventory of monies taken in and what's going out and what the fees and everything were. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4078.631s">Also,</a> there's an inclusion in there that the operator, meaning Park Method, would agree to submit on an annual basis the gross revenue and the operating expenses <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4088.74s">So</a> on an annual basis, so rather than having you go and get all the monthly things, I'm requesting that the council puts a resolution forward, making that request as it relates to their annual revenue, relative to the fact that this is what took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4105.126s">For</a> example, you would have net city parking revenue, that's annual appeals, the annual appeal, dismissal, forgiveness, annual resident visitor parking permits, business permits, <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4118.592s">commuter</a> permits, annual parking citations. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4122.074s">And</a> then we get to the issue on an annual basis of the $50,000 annually that would go to the commercial districts here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4134.08s">Now</a> that was something that came up by Mayor McGlynn in, I believe, October of 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4139.923s">And</a> as a result of that, that became a bone of consternation between <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4146.513s">the</a> Medford Chamber of Commerce and the business people, and as well as the issue on the city council relative toward the business districts not getting X amount of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4157.182s">Therefore,</a> as a result of that, what took place was that in October of that year, the city at that time through Mayor McGlynn, and then Park Medford came to a final resolution before January of 2015, <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4173.491s">and</a> 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4175.412s">And</a> in 2015, that $50,000 for each square was then included as part of the agreement between Park Method and the City of Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4184.458s">And</a> in their brochure, they note specifically that $250,000 annually will be subject to the appropriation for district improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4193.243s">Now,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4194.269s">I</a> don't know where that money is, if it's ever gone there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4197.311s">Some</a> people say it's gone out once. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4199.392s">Some</a> people say maybe it has, maybe it hasn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4201.753s">I</a> don't know, I can't answer that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4203.354s">That's</a> the reason why I'm asking for this breakdown and how the money was being expended. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4209.637s">Next,</a> we have the issue relative toward $2 million a year is what Park Method said that they would bring in annually to the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4220.623s">So</a> if we look at that $2 million per year, <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4223.996s">And</a> in the contract, there was an inclusion that anything over $1,250,000 annually, the city would increase from its annual 35% net revenues to 83%. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4235.479s">The</a> question then becomes where, and if in fact, has Park Method submitted that type of information to the city of Metro? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4243.702s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4244.162s">None</a> of us know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4245.823s">And</a> again, once again, that's the reason why I'm here asking you folks to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4250.902s">So</a> then let's go to the issue that basically talks about, I think it was in October during a city council strike that award six committee candidates on October of 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4263.351s">Then</a> council Longo addressed the community at that point in time as it related to the method parking program. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4271.838s">Quote,</a> this is what she said, as to parking enforcement, it is broken. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4276.86s">If</a> elected, I will end the contract that expires during the next mayoral term. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4281.824s">I</a> will go back to the committee recommendations of 2009 to implement in-house enforcement and replace the kiosks with meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4290.35s">I</a> will provide free parking for our seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4293.532s">The</a> city will benefit by keeping 100% of the gross revenue for our city services and schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4299.036s">We</a> currently see only 35% of the revenues. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4302.577s">Now,</a> that's a tough point right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4304.759s">35%</a> of the revenues, because we really don't know because you've never received the public documentation back. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4309.944s">You,</a> Mr. President, have asked three times. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4313.047s">Resolutions</a> go back and suggest that and prove that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4316.67s">So</a> where do we go from there? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4318.752s">That's</a> the question of why I think you really need to know how much money has come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4324.386s">How</a> has park method delivered as they're supposed to occur, so into the contract and the city of Medford, how they made an accounting for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4331.451s">It's</a> public information, it needs to be made public. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4334.213s">So</a> the question then becomes, if in fact the contract has been adhered to, and if in fact revenues have exceeded that for which the 35% formula has taken place. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4348.484s">But</a> the question then becomes, if it hasn't taken place, <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4352.346s">then</a> where are those revenues? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4355.228s">There's</a> also a report that's out that you can go on Google and it's by the Method Parking Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4362.454s">And</a> they have a report that goes out there that basically says, through their Google webpage, that on an annual basis, the city of Medford is, if you add up their numbers, that the city of Medford has only collected approximately $436,000 per year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4377.567s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4381.485s">Number</a> two, the statistics that the city has in the city of Medford allegedly will substantiate that we're only getting 35% rather than the 83%, which would indicate we haven't exceeded that for which you would get the $1.3 million annual money that they collected. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4400.822s">But</a> according to Park Medford, when they first came in, they said that their annual revenue would be in excess of $2 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4406.243s">So</a> $2 million over a period of 20 years, or even over a period of eight years, would give you $16 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4411.845s">We're</a> nowhere, we're nowhere near that type of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4415.286s">So</a> I would strongly suggest that if this be the case, what really needs to be addressed is as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4421.848s">We</a> have the 2009 report to which Council Marks served on there with the then former Chief of Police Sacco and a whole list of other folks who made up an extensive and an exhaustive report. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4434.952s">as</a> to how much they went to other communities, they checked it out, they saw how the revenues could come in and where it should go in here for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4442.935s">The</a> question then becomes Mr. President, if elected means she has been elected. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4447.837s">So</a> since the mayor has now been elected, the question then becomes the 35%. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4452.899s">We</a> really need to get these numbers to find out, are we in the 35% or are we above the 35%? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4458.702s">And</a> lastly, just let me say this, and this is really the perplexing question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4463.063s">If</a> in fact we follow what the mayor <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4465.424s">Then</a> city council said in October of 2019, to follow that formula of this report, why then do we have another new committee report of people? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4477.326s">Is</a> the mayor going to change plans, change direction, not follow the 2009 report? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4483.107s">I</a> think you people really need to know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4484.807s">And</a> if people are sitting on that committee and it's gonna be a waste of time because you're just gonna follow the exhausted committee report of 2009, that needs to be relegated out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4494.534s">You</a> know, this is a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4497.116s">And</a> if we're only looking at $436,000 a year as compared to a lot more than that, because we haven't gotten to the $2 million mark per year, you need to know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4506.824s">And</a> you really need to have a discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4508.865s">And</a> it was you then Councilor, Mr. President and Councilor Knight and Councilor Marks and Councilor Brianna Longo-Cunningham had serious questions with Park Method over this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4518.962s">You</a> indicated, Mr. President, that this is year eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4521.905s">This</a> is years eight, nine, and 10 are the years for negotiation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4525.688s">And</a> they're taking them one year at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4527.469s">Well,</a> if they're taking them one year at a time, and the mayor said, and when she ran for mayor, that she was going back and she was going to get rid of Park Method, then the plan ought to be that Park Method's going to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4538.559s">There</a> should be no negotiation to extend anything here.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4557.293s">I</a> believe this is the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4558.713s">I</a> may have the wrong terminology. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4559.973s">This</a> is the committee to discuss parking in the city of Medford.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4604.457s">So</a> then the question that I asked the council and to you, Mr. President, if the mayor indicated she was going to look at the 2009, she was going to adhere to that report, then the traffic, this new committee that's been put together, are they discussing this report to add or subtract? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4619.46s">Is</a> the mayor not going to support this? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4621.82s">Are</a> she going to entertain another type of situation? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4624.441s">Because</a> this is very conflicting.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4630.427s">Well,</a> if you're going to be on one year renewals in years eight, nine, and 10, give you the option to bow out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4635.689s">And</a> you've had plenty of time to realize coming into your option year that something should be taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4641.332s">So</a> are we going to, as a community, take three years in a row as option years and work at it one at a time? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4648.355s">I</a> mean, you know.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4703.148s">Mr.</a> President, I'd like to answer that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4704.83s">A</a> constant night brings up a good point that three years when it first came up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4709.031s">was</a> nixed by then city solicitor Mark Romney. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4711.992s">He</a> said it would not serve in the best financial interest of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4716.074s">That</a> bumped up the contract to 10 years, but given years eight, nine, and 10, the flexibility, whether you'd want to renegotiate, get out or whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4725.237s">I'm</a> only concerned over the fact that you, Mr. President, dating back at least three times going back to 2016, coming forward with council resolution have asked for these numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4735.325s">Senior</a> citizens have been waiting to park for nothing for free, because that's what was alleged. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4740.106s">Same</a> comment was made in Inauguration Day, same comment was made in 2009. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4745.708s">So</a> if we're not going to follow this report of 2009, which is very extensive, and it wasn't just for the city of Medford, you can correct me Councilor Marks, you went to other cities and towns, you saw how they derived their revenue through meters and their timing, and whether they had resident parking, commuter parking, this and that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4764.068s">If</a> that is not going to really be entertained, I just think that this parking commission, Councilor Scott Bell, it's just a waste of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4771.624s">We</a> either follow something or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4773.964s">Are</a> you going to change it? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4774.965s">And</a> I think the mayor has an obligation to tell you and the taxpayers of this community, whether in fact we're going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4781.546s">Why</a> would you want to go into two more years of one year contracts trying to figure out what you're going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4786.967s">You</a> should know by now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4788.567s">Resolutions</a> dating back to 2016 and 17 with her name and many councilors names on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4794.189s">Question,</a> just as councilor Knight has indicated, the veracity of this contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4799.33s">I</a> mean, how is it going to work with the city of Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4802.429s">Approximately</a> $2 million in uncollected money is still outstanding again. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4808.26s">This</a> is on the Google page of the Medford Parking Commission.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4825.294s">Councilor</a> President, I'm going to disagree with you, because when this council issue came up before the council, it started in May of 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4831.479s">And</a> it ran on for a few months. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4833.861s">While</a> the mayor and some of the councilors had a difference of opinion, <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4836.463s">It</a> did go on, there was some public interaction. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4839.305s">And</a> if this mayor is going to entertain a new contract without having the council interaction and public awareness and public input, that's bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4847.729s">This</a> is really bad because that's not what you call transparency.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5137.58s">Mr.</a> President, one quick thing.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5142.001s">Councilor</a> Marks, you talked about Everett, talked about Revere, talked about Somerville, you talked about Boston, Brookline, Malden, and Everett. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5152.483s">A</a> thorough report from the hiring of a clerk to the amount of people that walked the streets and the monies that were collected. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5158.605s">You're</a> not gonna get more of a thorough report than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5160.705s">And</a> this new commission, for whatever the reason is, it's out there and why the mayor is doing it, <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5165.505s">And</a> nobody knows, but that question ought to be asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5168.166s">If</a> you made the commitment in 2019 to do with this one, why are you going in a different direction? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5173.489s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5174.59s">Mr.</a> President, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5178.432s">Council</a> member.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_DEN45jLIzGE/2024-11-19_DEN45jLIzGE.html">City Council 03-16-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2496.042s">My</a> name is Robert Pentez, Zero Summit Road, Method Nest. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2500.766s">And</a> I think what I have on the agenda is a discussion of Method's pay to park program. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2508.811s">And</a> I believe you gave me the catalyst to do this, Mr. Caraviello, Council President, because for some years you've asked for a report <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2517.686s">and</a> we really haven't gotten a report. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2519.687s">I</a> don't know if you can hear me on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2521.848s">Is</a> this coming through?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2524.609s">You</a> can hear me, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2526.029s">Okay,</a> I'd like to go back to, as a quick side note, to September of 2009, when then Mayor McGlynn had a commission set up as it relates to how was parking going to be addressed in the city because it was a revenue item here in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2543.276s">At</a> that point in time, Councilor Marks served on that committee <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2547.489s">And</a> one of their recommendations was to possibly look into having a civilian parking commission in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2554.194s">Now</a> that was in 2009. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2557.075s">And</a> it didn't take place until I believe it started in May of 2014, when then Mayor McGlynn decided we were going to do something about parking here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2568.983s">And</a> as a result of that, from the months of May through the months of December of 2014, we went through <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2576.884s">an</a> arduous task of reviewing how and what packing was going to be here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2583.887s">So</a> what I'm asking for is that a complete breakdown from inception, starting from calendar year 2015, right up to date, be brought forward, and I'm going to pass out something for all you councillors at the end, that we get so not only the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2600.995s">councillors,</a> but we as citizens have an idea of just how much money that's coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2607.058s">Asking</a> for a complete itemized detail is found in the contract that was signed by the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2614.462s">And</a> at that point in time, the public parking point, I believe has been resold. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2619.425s">And</a> it states on page five on section six on the gross revenue, it says within 20 days after the end of each month, the operator shall provide to the city a statement showing all revenue, including details <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2633.742s">of</a> citation revenue, meter revenue, permit revenue, and other revenues. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2638.225s">And</a> this statement must include a copy of the monthly statement from the separate bank accounts utilized by the operator for the payments and received by the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2647.97s">So</a> I'm really not asking for anything other than what should be in this building right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2653.073s">But</a> the only thing that this building has been able to afford was in the calendar year 2015 and the calendar year 2016, the first report <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2663.213s">that</a> the then city council asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2665.895s">And</a> subsequent to that, nothing has come forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2668.496s">I</a> believe you have asked three times, Mr. President for a report, an itemized report for which the contract says they were obligated to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2676.962s">So</a> we're not asking for anything that's outrageous. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2678.963s">It's</a> in this building somewhere, somehow. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2682.245s">Now,</a> another thing you need to remember is they said, they meaning Republic at the time, they said that the revenues coming into the city of Medford would be approximately $2 million per year. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2693.844s">So</a> right now we're into the end of the seventh year. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2696.586s">So</a> that would be approximately $14 million thereabouts to be accounted for according to their terms as it relates to what the revenues would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2706.215s">But</a> if you go on the Medford Parking Commission, they have a Google page here from the city of Medford and they extrapolated from Park Medford, a list of outstanding monies that have owned this old, the city of Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2722.214s">since</a> 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2722.534s">In</a> 2015, still owed, if I'm reading it correctly, it's $339,449. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2725.377s">In</a> 2016, it's $368,140. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2725.697s">In</a> 2017, it's $375,611. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2726.157s">2018,</a> it's $351,470. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2726.518s">2019,</a> it's $339,449. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2751.378s">$148</a> and past year 2020 was $163,875. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2758.441s">Again,</a> if I'm reading this correctly, but I'm standing here tonight to be corrected if I'm wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2763.143s">But</a> from reading what Park Method has submitted and what the Method Parking Commission is saying, that's $1,937,693. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2771.947s">That's</a> outstanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2772.967s">That's</a> still owed here to the city of Medford.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2780.612s">He's</a> a random.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2789.755s">These</a> amounts have yet to be accounted for as being satisfied.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2798.498s">Well,</a> I'm just telling you with the traffic commission, parking commission, excuse me, it's put on their webpage. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2805.1s">But</a> again, as I said, I stand here to be corrected. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2807.901s">Plus</a> the fact, plus the fact I believe <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2811.574s">the</a> $2 million per year that was indicated was part of what park, I mean, Republic Parking said on October, 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2822.639s">So</a> if we look and if these numbers are true, there's a little bit of a problem there, why they haven't been collected upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2831.024s">But</a> therefore, if we're getting $2 million a year for the last seven years, that's $14 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2837.372s">years</a> eight, nine, and 10, I believe are they're renegotiating yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2840.273s">So</a> I really don't know if the city's renegotiating. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2842.874s">I</a> know they have a new traffic commission, a group of people looking at where you should go and how you're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2848.416s">And</a> I think you guys and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2850.997s">Morell,</a> you should be up to date as it relates to, you know, what the city is doing with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2856.259s">Another</a> thing is there is, and I believe- Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2863.481s">It</a> was an October- What information council members?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2888.475s">Being</a> aware of the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2889.396s">So</a> if in fact these numbers are any way correct, that's $1,937,000 takes back to 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2896.071s">there's</a> something wrong with the city not being able to get that money, separate issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2900.634s">Taking</a> that one step forward, in October of 2014, for those of you that might remember, there was the argument of the five squares, Medford Square being one, would get on an annual basis $50,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2913.084s">And</a> that was a ball of contention, especially here in the city of Medford, Chamber of Commerce, and then Mayor Mike McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2919.268s">But</a> toward the end of the year, I believe it was in December of 2014, there was an agreement reached <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2925.923s">There</a> was an agreement reached with Park Method as it relates to, they now, they would be willing to submit $250,000 would be earmarked. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2937.188s">$250,000</a> would be earmarked on an annual basis, 50,000 for each square. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2940.85s">They</a> put that in their folder, in their folder that they passed out, which specifically states that $250,000 annually be subject to appropriation for the district improvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2953.375s">That's</a> the five districts here in the city of Metro. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2955.69s">I</a> know it's been some conversation with the chamber, and I know it's been asked a couple of times, but if that'd be the case, that $50,000 a year going forward for four of the last five years would be approximately $200,000 each square that they haven't seen. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2972.333s">Again,</a> the accounting of the money, this goes back to like last week on the water money, on the fees, there has to be an accounting where it's going, how it's being spent, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2983.543s">So</a> if you take that, put that all together, Mr. President, Mr. Messenger, could you please pass this up? <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2990.124s">I'm</a> asking on this particular issue here. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2997.525s">I</a> think it's important to know that while you might be having a commission or a committee to be looking at the parking revenues, there doesn't seem to be anything going forward because it states on page six, I believe, of the contract <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3013.588s">that</a> this has to be a renegotiating year with the people that we have in the city right now, years eight, nine, and 10, is the city in fact in a negotiation with the parking company?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3031.06s">You're</a> on a one year contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3032.2s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3032.941s">So</a> for example, if we're on a one year contract, which is year eight, which we're on right now, it's possible at any point in time, this contract ends at the end of this year.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3044.375s">So</a> it's up to the administration that that be the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3046.996s">I</a> would thank Mr. President if in fact that the two million dollars was the estimated amount that we would be getting on an annual basis and we're looking at 1.9 million plus and monies that are owed. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3058.563s">Something's</a> not jiving here because those monies whether they're making the two million dollars a year or not <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3065.555s">How</a> do you let each and every year, how do you let that just continue to escalate and escalate and escalate? <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3070.518s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3071.298s">It's</a> unfair to the people who pay every single day to use the meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3076.08s">And</a> it's unfair as to the contract as it's written. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3079.942s">So</a> it's either a lack of enforcement or I'm reading these numbers wrong, or there's something wrong on the adding and subtracting of how this money's being spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3089.827s">What</a> you have here, what I gave you comes right out of the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3094.49s">The</a> contract is even more specific and more definitive as to what you're looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3099.571s">That,</a> as it's written, tells you basically how much money is coming in and where's the majority of it going. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3105.233s">The</a> key point to all of this is whether you stay with the company you have now or you go with a new company, you have an in-house, something has to be considered as it relates to outstanding liabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3117.755s">And</a> you can't run $1,900,000 in an ongoing liability that started from day one. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3125.319s">It</a> just doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3127.3s">So</a> I would hope that somebody would make a resolution and ask for an annual breakdown of Park Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3135.544s">I</a> mean, what the contract says does for the city.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3143.429s">Say</a> it again.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3145.57s">Well,</a> that's what I'm asking.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3458.763s">Back</a> in May of 2017, what was presented here before the city of Medford was a new, what they call a base, <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3467.498s">rate</a> of 861 per household. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3470.979s">And</a> then the different charge would be for the commercial district folks here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3478.622s">And</a> then one of the arguments was that it would raise $1 million a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3483.384s">That</a> was approximately 4% of what the city's budget was at that point in time required for the water and sewer services in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3491.807s">Subsequent</a> to that, it's gone on for the last three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3496.0s">now</a> coming into its fourth fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3498.821s">And</a> I believe a response that was sent back to the city, you folks, pursuant to a request from one of your colleagues, was a breakdown of how much money each and every one of the last three fiscal years amounted to. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3513.945s">Inclusive</a> of that amount, again, was the term of $1 million to be used per year, but they never reached the $1 million per year. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3524.563s">What</a> was reached was $2,585,362.66 as compared to the $3 million that was allegedly stated that the city would gain. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3538.411s">That's</a> a difference of $414,637. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3539.612s">So</a> where do we go with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3544.875s">Where</a> we go with that, the argument was that that would be used to supplement water and sewer for whatever needs might be if something were to come up <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3554.937s">also</a> to subsidize the water and sewer department in case of something that's anticipated. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3561.501s">In</a> the letter that came back, it indicated here that the universal connectivity fee is an infrastructure recovery charge to be hooked into and maintained in the water and sewer system. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3574.349s">The</a> fixed base connectivity fee is estimated at $1 million per year to help stabilize revenues in this place. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3584.439s">That</a> response also indicated that that money goes to your water and sewer account. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3590.161s">There</a> is no breakdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3592.182s">There</a> is no breakdown to the charges, commercial or residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3597.084s">There</a> is no breakdown also as to how and where that money has been spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3602.127s">And</a> there is no program that is set up presently that tells you what that money can be used for. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3608.149s">So</a> right now, all it's done has been included into your water and sewer account. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3612.957s">One</a> of the misnomers to this whole project, when sold back in 2017, was in case there is a, in case, that's the word, in case there is a deficit in either the water or sewer account. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3625.904s">In</a> the years 2016 and 17, there were deficits on the sewer side, not the water side. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3632.428s">But</a> each and every year, when the water and sewer budget is estimated, it's estimated on what the work is going to be here in the city of Medford, and also, <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3640.852s">The</a> water and the sewer rates that you get from the MWRA, those rates come in ahead of time, not after a budget is made and set. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3648.896s">That's</a> another misnomer as it relates to the full program. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3652.118s">So</a> approximately right now, you're sitting on $2,585,000 of base rate fees or charges, whatever the term you want to use, that has come from the Mr. and Mrs. Metro taxpayer has been put into the general revenues of your water and sewer account. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3671.14s">That</a> ladies and gentlemen is not the proper accounting practices and procedures because in your own water and sewer account, you have to have it broken down. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3681.064s">You</a> have it broken down by employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3683.185s">You</a> have it broken down by cost of material. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3685.586s">You</a> have it broken down by the named individuals in the trucks and everything else that goes along with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3691.309s">My</a> suggestion to you folks would be simply this. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3695.231s">You</a> can't put a fee on somebody or a charge <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3698.987s">without</a> knowing what you're charging them for. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3702.228s">It's</a> not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3703.429s">If</a> that's the case, you should have just raised the water and sewer account by the approximate 4% that you think it was going to do to offset it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3711.031s">So</a> if you're sitting on a surplus of approximately $7 million or thereabouts in your water and sewer enterprise account, and you're sitting on approximately having already raised $2.5 million, but you still don't know how it was spent, where it was gonna go, <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3727.116s">Where</a> is the projected projects that are supposed to come? <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3730.238s">It</a> doesn't make any sense because right now, what it's saying is it's a water and sewage charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3735.881s">It</a> was to services in case something were to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3740.984s">The</a> original proposal back in 2017 was the charge for the water meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3746.607s">And</a> that was the charge that was going to be placed on each and every residential person. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3751.27s">So</a> we know right now that that charge every single time, once it comes out, <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3756.162s">is</a> not for the meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3757.642s">But</a> unfortunately, for accounting purposes, because you can't figure it out, in this city, in the accounting department, there is nothing to be found that'll tell you how and where that money was spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3769.145s">But</a> you can find it in water and sewer, in their particular budgets, independently separated. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3774.806s">My</a> suggestion would be to you, that you have a budget coming up this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3779.067s">I</a> would hope that maybe somebody would make a request and ask the question, because it doesn't make any sense <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3784.759s">that</a> the response that came back from the finance director, we don't keep an accounting. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3789.882s">Well,</a> if you don't keep an accounting, how do you keep an accounting of residential and commercial meters that you have and what you're going to be charged? <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3799.367s">How</a> can you allege that you're going to be taking in a million dollars a year when you haven't even got to that figure? <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3806.171s">Something</a> needs to be said as it relates to these type of budgetary items. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3810.813s">Seven</a> weeks ago, I came in here and I think I explained something like seven items. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3814.81s">I'm</a> going to go through them all one at a time, not tonight, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3818.232s">I</a> will go through them all one at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3820.374s">Because</a> good accounting procedures tells you what comes in has got to go out and how does it go out. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3827.579s">You've</a> got situations here that you really don't know why should you be charging these people to supplement or augment a water and sewer account that's presently sitting in millions of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3838.106s">You</a> have yet to be told what the cost is going to be for an anticipated construction <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3843.756s">sidewalk,</a> street reconstruction might be because of water and sewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3848.278s">So</a> if you keep taking in these monies from Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer, you're overcharging them. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3854.061s">You're</a> overcharging them each and every year on this base rate, the speed, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3859.123s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3904.033s">Well,</a> while that may be true, there's also, you talk about general accounting practices. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3908.295s">General</a> accounting practices does state that if you are going to put a budgetary item on a budget, as you councilors get each and every year, the question needs to be asked, if I'm going to just put $100 million, so to speak, and put it into a line item, and there's no accounting of the money, other than the fact I just put it into an account, what's the purpose of that? <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3929.019s">So</a> you're right, it's an administrative prerogative, but when it came up in May of 2017, it was contentiously argued at this Medford City Council as to why we need this new fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3940.91s">And</a> at that point in time, the argument was for the purposes of the meters, for the accounting of the meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3947.015s">Now</a> it's going into the general revenue, and now we're being told that there is no delineation, there's no explanation, there's no accounting of how that money's being spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3955.202s">So</a> if that's the case, <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3956.607s">And</a> as Councilors, if there's no explanation of how it's being spent, before you used to have the accounting firm of Melanson and Heath, you don't have them anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3964.609s">You</a> have them for like 15 years out of New Hampshire. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3966.809s">You</a> have a new accounting company that comes in here, they're supposed to do an annual audit. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3970.73s">That</a> question ought to come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3972.05s">Because</a> if you remember correctly, if you looked at the Melanson and Heath audits, that was one of their concerns on the MWRA, especially in our water and sewer accounts, if you go back and read them, the accounting and the prioritizing how the money is spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3985.946s">This</a> account, or this money, Councilor Knight, there's no accounting with the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3990.329s">It</a> just goes into a general revenue.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4003.38s">As</a> watchdogs of the city's money, over and beyond the administration, the administration can make a proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4008.924s">The</a> bottom line is here with the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4010.325s">You</a> either vote it up or you vote it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4012.187s">And</a> if you're going to vote it up or you're going to vote it down, <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4014.161s">The</a> question is, what are you voting on? <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4016.222s">And</a> if something comes to your attention to be questioned as to why and how, this is where it's going to take place in the Medford City Council Chambers.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4038.148s">Then</a> I would respectfully suggest, if we follow that train of thought, I would respectfully suggest a freedom of information <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4044.3s">request</a> to the city auditor, asking the city auditor. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4050.681s">As</a> to why, Mr. President, why there is no accounting. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4056.362s">When</a> you get the money from the MWRA ahead of time, before a budget is made, there's an accounting of how that money is going to be spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4063.964s">You</a> have money.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4073.166s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Biss. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4074.577s">I</a> believe, Mr. President, a Freedom of Information Act can come from anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4078.579s">And</a> if the council does not get it as you got it from the response from the finance person, then you would go to that next group. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4086.182s">Because</a> again, if you follow what Councilor Neider said, if allegedly it comes from the Water and Soil Commission, it's their call, maybe their call to implement it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4093.805s">But</a> it's your call to decide how and where, if it's going to be spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4097.727s">And</a> you guys can ask for an accounting of how the money is being spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4103.81s">That's</a> it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4104.807s">You're</a> more than happy to answer the questions because it's the finances of our community and you can't keep tagging on to Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer and now not having an answer or an explanation.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4484.852s">Mr.</a> President, just on that matter, just to go back and reflect, Demita's had a lifespan of 10 to 12 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4490.826s">I</a> don't know if it's 13 to 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4492.986s">But</a> that's a perfect example, a perfect example of when you have a budget that's coming up from the Department of Public Works, having a projection, for example, on new water meters, that dollar amount in anticipation needs to be in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4506.377s">And</a> while it's into the proposed budget that you folks deliberate over, it's likewise the same type of money that can be deliberated over the base fee for which goes in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4517.406s">You</a> back then, Council March, talked about the retained earnings, but the retained earnings, <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4521.781s">has</a> to be something that's certified and qualified by the Department of Revenue and subsequently voted upon by the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4528.587s">So</a> taking all of that into consideration, you're dealing with a multi-million dollar surplus right now in your water and sewer account, and you also have inclusive of that multi-million dollar, you're talking about two and a half million dollars right now that's been collected. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4543.781s">So</a> how does that fit into either retained earnings or the water and sewer balance <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4549.425s">Is</a> it off by two and a half minute because this is a new dollar amount in there?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4585.77s">And</a> in 2016, Mr. President, the deficit was 467,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4587.091s">And</a> in 2017, it was 427,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4587.551s">That</a> was on the SOAR account, but that was offset on the opposite side. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4596.793s">Council</a> March is talking about because of the retained earnings of the surplus that was in the water and sewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4601.516s">All</a> I'm saying, all I'm saying is this account, if it's included in your water and sewer account, it should be accounted for and how it's spent or anticipated to be spent, just like any project that's going to be done in the forthcoming year. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4615.767s">And</a> there was also a dollar amount contained in the budget for unanticipated expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4620.991s">You</a> may have a street that just blows open, a major line that blows open, I don't know, but the money is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4626.42s">And</a> lastly, let me just say this, Mr. President, each and every year, I don't know, coming into this year, each and every year, there's been approximately a million dollars in surplus that's left over from the prior year's budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4637.769s">So</a> each and every year for the last maybe 10 to 12 years, there's been approximately a million dollars, and that money, which is left over, once it's certified by the Department of Revenue, it's leftover money, can be used for any unanticipated debt deficit that takes place in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4652.761s">But</a> we don't have to do it because you've got surpluses, <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4655.819s">in</a> the water and sewer enterprise.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4658.501s">You're</a> welcome.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2976.834s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2978.175s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marksley. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2979.155s">I</a> appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2979.616s">I</a> don't know if you can hear me, if it makes it any clearer. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2982.658s">What</a> Councilor Marksley has alluded to has brought me into this issue of public accounting as to what took place as it related to this <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2992.09s">connectivity</a> fee, that's what it was called. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2994.373s">So</a> it was implemented in August of 2017, and for the last three years, it has brought in in excess of $3 million to the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3003.872s">And</a> having that at $3 million and not knowing how and what it's been used for, and if it was going to be an adjunct to the water and sewer system here in the city of Medford, then so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3014.954s">We</a> always get in advance from the MWRA their projected assessment as to what the city is going to be charged for water and sewer charges. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3024.136s">And</a> that is built in your annual budget each and every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3027.357s">And</a> each and every year since then, the projection that this could be possibly used for a deficit has never happened because we're still dealing with the surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3036.084s">So</a> I think what Councilman Marks is alluding to is the fact that, you know, if you've collected $3 million, what have you used it for, number one? <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3044.47s">What</a> do you have projected for its use? <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3047.072s">What</a> is the cost for it? <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3048.893s">And</a> more importantly, if it is separate from water and sewer, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3053.196s">As</a> we know that you can't take the money from water and sewer because that's considered to be retained earnings. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3057.88s">And</a> the only way you can get through retained earnings is to the Department of Revenue to get a waiver and 90% of the time that they will give it to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3065.287s">But</a> this is something that has led me after the resolution went on, if you can just bear with me, to other things that unfortunately the council and the public have not been apprised of and brought forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3077.597s">This</a> base fee charge at a minimum of $51.66 annually, that's on the house side. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3082.405s">I</a> don't know what the commercial side would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3084.489s">But</a> if in fact it's bringing in approximately a million dollars a year, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3090.143s">If</a> you look at your most recent tax bill here in the city of Medford, which is for the third quarter, they implemented a new system with a new vendor. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3098.706s">And</a> the new vendor has really got this bill basically messed up. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3101.867s">It's</a> going to be changed because they made a big mistake on it, especially when it gets to the tax itself and it talks about your CPA tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3110.423s">If</a> you think about what's going on, and if you think about the taxes here that are going on here in the city of Medford, what can we do to some degree to help the Medford taxpayer as to what's going on and everything that's going on? <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3123.413s">So</a> what I would like to just introduce to you is something for you to think about. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3128.437s">When</a> you look at your water and sewer tax.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3143.901s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3144.422s">If</a> you can look at your water and sewer bill, and if you can look at your tax bill, I'd like to introduce something for the council entertainers. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3150.626s">It's</a> called a deadline discount program. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3154.79s">And</a> a deadline and discount program, which is implemented in a lot of states and a lot of counties, that the month that you get the bill, your tax bill, for example, you get your tax bill in November, and I believe it's due February 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3169.181s">The</a> next one is February 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3171.042s">But</a> if you pay it on the month that you receive it, there's a 4% discount on your bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3176.043s">The</a> next month, which would be January, there would be a 3% discount. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3180.944s">And</a> the city in itself would be getting its money quicker. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3184.125s">And</a> at the same time, the taxpayer would be getting a break as it relates to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3188.806s">Same</a> thing as it relates to your water and sewer bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3191.306s">If</a> you get your water and sewer bill, it's usually six or seven weeks out before you pay it. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3196.247s">And</a> the month that you get it, or the month before, you get a 4% discount if you pay for it ahead of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3201.368s">It's</a> a thought, but it does work because it gets the city money quicker before you get it quicker. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3207.052s">Pinellas</a> County in Florida, one of many counties, have implemented that and they've shown a marketable increase, a marketable increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3215.271s">Another</a> thing, Mr. President, when we talk about the city's unfunded liability, for which this council, I can go back to 2014, Resolution 214725 was offered by myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3227.906s">And</a> that particular resolution asked that on an annual basis, the city of Metra take out of its free cash a minimum <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3234.094s">of</a> $500,000 toward then in fund liability of $29 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3239.976s">I</a> have no idea what the unfunded liability is. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3242.316s">And</a> I don't think this council has any idea of what the balance is and how much each and every year has been taken out of the budget for the purposes of getting to that unfunded liability, which has to be paid by 2029. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3255.54s">Another</a> thing for which the taxpayers and the council should be aware of waste management. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3261.688s">And</a> I don't know if you guys are aware of it, but in March of 2014, then Mayor McGlynn signed an extension, a three-year extension to the waste management contract in the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3273.652s">And</a> that three-year extension went as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3276.353s">For</a> the first year, the City of Medford would get $300,000 in cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3279.734s">The</a> second year, they would get $100,000 more. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3281.475s">That's</a> $400,000 from 2014 going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3282.435s">But</a> the catch to the whole thing was as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3291.705s">The</a> amendment was, if you remember correctly, for those who did serve back then, recycling was an issue here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3300.362s">And</a> at that point in time, when the contract was signed, we were at 11%. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3304.638s">At</a> some point in time, the city worked itself up to a 29% inventory of recycling. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3311.601s">But</a> as a result of the city signing off on a three-year extension, what took place there was that the city of Medford allowed waste management, allowed waste management to increase our cost of recycling on an annual basis projected at <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3330.978s">$85</a> per ton, and then it would set itself on an annual basis increase, according to the city of Boston, beginning on July 1st, 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3341.082s">That's</a> almost six months, that's almost a good year after the contract was signed. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3345.386s">And</a> as a result of that, each and every year, the city of Medford has been being charged more for recycling than they had been according to the original agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3354.596s">So</a> for $300,000, $400,000 that the city got paid up front, the cost of recycling has gone forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3362.103s">And</a> once this contract ends in the year 2023, yeah 2023, all the recycling bins, all the recycling bins that the people have in this city will come under the control of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3373.833s">They'll</a> own it and not waste management. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3376.536s">Another</a> thing that I believe, Mr. President, needs to really be discussed is the CPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3381.44s">Once</a> again, taxpayers on an annual basis are at a cost of approximately $103, according to your household, in the value of your home. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3390.427s">Now,</a> the CPA, as we all know, five years are up. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3394.93s">Any</a> time after five years, according to the law, as it's written, that question can go back on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3401.094s">And</a> I would strongly suggest that this council put that question back on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3405.197s">Because</a> when it was first elected in 2015, 1,200 people did not vote on the question because it was on the backside of the ballot, and they didn't know that the question was there to be asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3419.147s">$103,</a> think about that, annually for CPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3422.089s">Then</a> you think about the $51 and the connectivity fee, and you put that together with maybe the discounts on paying for your taxes, it would be a great help to the city of Medford and to the taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3432.736s">Also,</a> Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3435.025s">Cable</a> costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3436.065s">Our</a> cable bills from the residents of this community keep going up each and every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3441.087s">They</a> just went up again. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3442.848s">But</a> they also have a 5% franchise fee in that cable bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3447.529s">You</a> folks have not got an update on what that increase has brought to the city of Medford and where that money has gone, at least for the last four or five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3456.072s">And</a> I know that's something that Councilor Marks had brought up before. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3459.373s">Then</a> we get to the parking issues, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3474.633s">This</a> presented itself, Mr. President, onto other issues which could be beneficial to the taxpayers, and it would be a public accounting so people could become aware of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3482.655s">Councilor</a> Penta?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3491.977s">Well,</a> we're almost done. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3493.017s">Do</a> you mind if I can just figure it out? <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3494.437s">Because</a> it's unfortunate. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3495.818s">You</a> know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3496.678s">You're</a> supposed to seize the moment as the moment is. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3499.138s">And</a> we're talking about the people of our community, what they have to pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3503.039s">Also,</a> at the same time, if we can offer them a benefit, and at the same time, the City gets a benefit. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3507.643s">It's</a> a matter of being creative and looking at what you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3510.746s">Parking</a> information. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3511.746s">You,</a> Mr. President, you have asked on numerous occasions, numerous occasions for a report on how many tickets have been issued, how many have been abated, how much money has been collected, and how much has been given to the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3523.496s">Excuse</a> me, none of you can do that because it's never been presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3526.699s">And</a> what about the $50,000 that was supposed to go to each and every square here in the City of Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3532.38s">It's</a> not there. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3533.46s">The</a> accounting for the squares hasn't come under any control as to what we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3538.741s">And</a> lastly, Mr. President, if we all remember at the inaugural, we were told that seniors in this city would not have to pay any more to park in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3546.943s">That</a> still hasn't come to fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3549.044s">That's</a> unfair, because you can't make a promise like that and not keep it, because that's what people look at, what your responsibilities are. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3557.346s">I</a> say this tonight, Mr. President, as I told you before, taxes pay for what makes this city run. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3563.328s">And</a> at the same time, the city has a responsibility back. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3565.67s">But</a> if it can be a two hand, shaken hands compromise, why not? <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3571.057s">Discounts</a> to your water and sewer bill, discount to your cable bills, finding out where that money went. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3577.301s">And</a> let's get back to the original thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3578.802s">The</a> connectivity fee that was supposed to be helpful here to the city of Medford, you've never had a report where it's going, how much it's brought in, what projects, if anything, and how much it's gonna cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3589.408s">And</a> why should that be considered an adjunct to the Water and Sewer Commission money, when in fact, if you can't project your budget in the future, <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3597.453s">Like</a> you're supposed to, and you get your water and sewer estimate ahead of time from the MWRA. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3603.083s">We</a> should not be thinking about a deficit when, again, you're just taking more money from the taxpayer without giving them the reason why you took it. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3610.389s">I'd</a> be more than happy to answer any questions, but I would hope that one of you, someone, even would get into the idea of showing and having some kind of a discount in advance for people who pay their taxes and for people who pay their water and sewer bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3624.659s">It's</a> out there, it's been a proven fact, and it does work. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3627.582s">And</a> it'd be a great handshake between taxpayers and the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3630.844s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Paeta. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3634.426s">I'd</a> be more than happy to answer any questions.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3638.628s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3795.796s">Mr.</a> Clerk, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3796.997s">Mr.</a> President, before you call the roll, one quick thing as a notation on the tax bills that come out. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3802.279s">You'll</a> notice it says police, fire, and library. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3805.68s">It</a> says 10, 25, 30, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3808.461s">Whoever</a> checks that, when those bills come out every quarter, I think it would be informative to have next to each one of those items how much money has been donated so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3819.676s">Because</a> that would give either an incentive or not for somebody to make a contribution. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3823.281s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3868.902s">On</a> the bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3869.422s">Okay,</a> under each item it'll tell you, they can put in parentheses, that would designate how much money.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3914.989s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4805.815s">Summit</a> Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4807.216s">Mr.</a> President, I want to go back to something that I had said earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4810.318s">I</a> would like the council to entertain what they call a deadline and discount program. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4815.442s">This</a> would relate itself to your water bills and also to your taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4820.807s">And</a> as I said before, it is well practiced in some states and some cities and towns where <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4828.112s">On</a> the month that you receive, for example, your tax bill, if you pay it that month, you get a 4% discount. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4834.174s">If</a> you pay it the next month before the bill is due, you get a 3% discount. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4838.556s">Or</a> you wait till the very last day and pay it like a lot of people do. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4842.178s">Same</a> thing with the water bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4843.398s">The</a> water bills doesn't have as much of a leeway time between the tax bills when they come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4848.14s">But</a> in the month that you receive the bill, it's usually halfway through the month. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4851.441s">If</a> you pay it that month, it's a 4% discount. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4854.202s">I</a> think it works well because it's a handshake between the cities and the taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4858.343s">And</a> if the taxpayer is looking for a little bit of a break, there it is right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4862.204s">If</a> you pay your bill ahead of time, you get a discount. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4864.625s">And</a> at the same time, the city gets its money to use at a quicker rate for whatever purpose it has. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4870.167s">I</a> think it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4871.007s">I</a> think it makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4872.467s">And</a> there's no loss to either side. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4874.228s">I</a> think it's a benefit to either side. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4875.889s">And</a> at the same time, <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4877.509s">What</a> you're doing is you're telling the taxpayers, you're basically thinking out for them the best way you can, and you're thinking out for the city the best way you can, because you're giving us the money quicker than we would have gotten if we had to wait almost eight weeks for you to pay your tax bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4891.9s">So</a> I would hope someone on the council would entertain it, present it before a committee of the whole for the purposes of discussing it, and moving forward with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4900.103s">It</a> works. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4902.424s">It</a> works in other cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4903.445s">It</a> works in other states and other cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4905.905s">And</a> as I told you earlier, it's just a way of saying to the taxpayers, we're hearing what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4914.149s">Everybody's</a> got these problems today. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4916.21s">We</a> want to help you out. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4918.067s">And</a> the second thing on the citizen participation, I just don't understand why tax seniors have to pay that once a year $25 tax to park in the city when we were told in January inauguration that the seniors would be able to park for nothing in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4933.387s">That</a> still hasn't happened yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4934.689s">I</a> don't know why. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4936.311s">It's</a> a promise that should have been kept, that needs to be kept, and it's just, once again, it's, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4942.895s">I</a> don't know how the city's operating lately, but all I can tell you is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4945.877s">You've</a> got to look for creative ways to keep the people's interest, and at the same time, to keep your own interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4953.022s">And</a> what I presented here tonight, I think, is a pretty good handshake with the taxpayers and with the city of Medford as well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4961.959s">Be</a> more than happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4963.38s">When</a> we talk about money here in the city of Medford, you talk about how the city is going to function. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4970.585s">And</a> the city can only function when the taxpayers are willing to pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4973.847s">And</a> sometimes people become delinquent in paying. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4976.349s">And</a> if they become delinquent, they can't pay it because they don't have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4979.291s">And</a> if those people that do have it want to relinquish some of their money quicker, <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4983.774s">and</a> get a discount for doing it, it helps the city because they get the money quicker. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4987.997s">And</a> the last thing I want to say, Mr. President, I think it really needs to entertain itself that the CPA, which is now five years has come and gone, should be looked at about presenting itself on the ballot this November coming in 2021 for the purposes of whether you're going to use it again and re-up it and what have you, because that's what the law says. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5005.57s">I'm</a> not advocating for it or against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5007.292s">What</a> I'm advocating is that the five years are up. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5010.195s">The</a> sunset legislation is now in effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5012.938s">And</a> if you don't do nothing, it's just going to stay there. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5016.261s">1,200</a> people in 2015 did not vote on that question because it was on the opposite side of the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5022.348s">They</a> weren't aware it was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5024.17s">So</a> we really have no idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5026.172s">whether</a> it would have passed or it didn't pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5028.474s">This</a> time, I think it would be incumbent if the question goes on the ballot, it's there, and the taxpayers make their decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5034.879s">That's</a> what it's about, the taxpayers' use of their money. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5037.521s">I'd</a> be more than happy to answer any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5041.625s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5042.686s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5157.829s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5158.569s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5167.819s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5169.443s">Relative</a> to Councilor Bears' comment, it doesn't make any difference whether it's in-state or out-of-state. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5173.986s">It's</a> how a city sets its tax rate and how it makes its collections. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5178.329s">All</a> I'm making reference to the fact that it works in other states. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5181.852s">It's</a> out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5182.893s">I</a> believe there's a few cities and towns in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5185.735s">It's</a> not my call. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5186.876s">It's</a> only an offering to be made. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5188.677s">And</a> if it works, as Councilor Marks has alluded to, how can it not work if you're getting your money quicker and you're having a discount paying it ahead of time? <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5196.683s">That's</a> all I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5197.644s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_puRJAp7j8rg/2024-11-19_puRJAp7j8rg.html">City Council 01-28-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=409.898s">Good</a> evening, my name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, and a former member of the August body. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=415.92s">I</a> come here tonight <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=417.987s">To</a> make some comments on issues that I feel are important as it relates to this upcoming budget, from what I understand this administration, and I know the Chief of Staff is here, he can reflect upon the fact that you guys and Lady are going to get an early budget this year, earlier than normal. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=435.088s">If</a> that's true, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=436.529s">Is</a> it true? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=437.628s">So</a> he says we hope so. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=438.768s">With</a> that being said, and with two new Councilors on the board, I would just like to reflect upon a couple of things as it relates to what really has not been addressed for the past few months. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=449.69s">First</a> of all, going back to last year at some point in time regarding the Lawrence Memorial Hospital, we never got a report back from the auditor's office as it relates to the outpatient surgical offices that are going to be housed <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=465.453s">in</a> the old Lawrence Memorial Hospital as part of an addendum to the 16,000 square foot building that the Lawrence Memorial Hospital is going to have their surgical center at. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=475.719s">And</a> with that being said, again, it's just out there floating around not knowing what's going to happen because they haven't made a decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=483.203s">Second</a> of all, it's the taxing of the nonprofit funeral portion <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=488.206s">of</a> the operation at the Gaffey Funeral Home, which houses the Islamic Cultural Center here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=495.068s">And</a> where they're going to be running a funeral business out of that center, once again, it presents itself as a for-profit business within the non-profit structure itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=506.011s">Again,</a> no answers come back on that as of yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=509.192s">And</a> these are issues that I think need to be discussed and resolved before or at least during your budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=515.834s">Also,</a> let's go back to something that Councilor Caraviello, when he first came on to the Council, talked about, the disrepair of the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=524.222s">At</a> that point in time, Councilor Caraviello indicated during his first term, it was $1.2 million of school repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=530.908s">We're</a> now in excess of $1.5 million of school repairs, and we're getting ourselves right into the same position, I shouldn't say ourselves, the city is getting itself into this position <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=541.758s">of</a> why we had to build new schools in the first place. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=544.059s">If</a> the upkeep is not going to be taking place, there is something wrong with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=549.401s">The</a> building of a new police station, contained within the building of the new police station, it's 5,000 square feet less than what was asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=557.965s">There</a> is no police firing range that is for qualification. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=563.208s">But</a> more importantly, the sad part about the whole thing, no police vehicle is going to be able to be housed internally. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=568.91s">They're</a> all going to be outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=571.365s">And</a> by doing that, all you're doing is leaving all your public service vehicles open to the elements. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=577.03s">So</a> if there's a snowstorm or whatever it might be, every police officer's gonna have to go out there and take the snow off it. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=582.034s">And</a> you try to explain that to the people of this community and you tell them that you're spending close to $20 million for a new police station, but you have no place to house or at least care for your police cruisers. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=594.656s">A</a> very important issue that seems to be lost in the weeds is the, at present, if not more, a $29 million unfunded pension liability that needs to be paid by 2029. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=606.781s">That</a> is yet to be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=610.322s">Also,</a> what needs to be addressed right now also is a citywide <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=616.474s">It's</a> called the Citywide Home Water Meter Battery Replacement Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=621.317s">Now</a> for those of you that have a house and you know when you get your water and sewer bill, the system was put in well over 10 years ago with meters that were only good for 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=631.523s">The</a> 10 years have come and gone, that's a cost factor and that's a replacement that needs to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=637.446s">We</a> still have yet to receive a cost projection for a new fire station as to where it will be, when it will be, and what it will cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=646.17s">There</a> is no projections out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=648.451s">And</a> still outstanding is the new training tower that was promised it would be built before the old one was taken down. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=657.274s">Well,</a> the old one has been taken down, and now nothing has been put up. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=662.116s">And</a> in fact, it does affect, in the city of Medford, your home insurance rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=667.213s">There's</a> no financial outline as to how the city's annual free cash should be prioritized. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=673.275s">For</a> the new councils coming on board, for the last few many years, it's almost a million dollars each and every year the city of Medford has left over, it just goes into free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=682.278s">So</a> that presents itself with one or two arguments. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=684.399s">Number</a> one, the budget is either not accurate, or number two, that million dollars is maybe not correct when the budget is being voted upon at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=694.463s">So</a> therefore, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=697.506s">To</a> me, it makes very good sense because a lot of cities and towns do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=701.488s">You</a> folks pass a budget in May or June, let's call it June, that should be the time you set your tax rate, not six months later. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=709.672s">So</a> if you do that, you're working on an actual annual budget that reflects upon that vote that took place in June that represents itself to each and every dollar itemized. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=722.077s">Also,</a> a public works five-year projection program that covers our streets, our sidewalks, our tree stumps, our equipment, our water repairs issues, and cemetery, as well as all personnel that's gonna be needed to address that. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=737.109s">That</a> would be a great program to have because number one, we're already understaffed and we're hiring immediately just two more people to work in the highway department that just basically on a daily basis is so understaffed and on demand. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=749.895s">Lastly,</a> for the purposes of at least this portion of the discussion, two points. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=756.477s">And</a> I know Councilor Caraviello once again has asked for this and Councilor Marks, you've asked for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=760.598s">You</a> should get a five-year financial recap from Park Medford on all the receipts taken in and what has been given to the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=768.459s">I</a> guarantee none of you have received anything from Park Medford as it relates to that financial responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=775.501s">And</a> lastly, Councilor Marks, you brought this up, yet to be determined <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=779.182s">Where</a> and for what reasons has the $500,000 from Tufts University been accounted for? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=785.185s">You</a> still don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=786.245s">We</a> still don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=788.186s">Now</a> moving over to the housing issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=791.345s">And</a> here's an issue right now that's in the forefront of everything as to what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=796.447s">So</a> let's just mention a few little things that are going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=800.028s">Right</a> now what we have on the books are 185 units that are coming online after Wendy's on Middlesex Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=807.19s">You</a> have 300 plus units opposite the Wellington Station. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=811.191s">You</a> have a proposed 400 Chapter 40B units next to the Middlesex Courthouse on Mystic Valley Parkway. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=818.553s">And</a> looking at the smaller neighborhood issue that took place on Forest Street, where a private developer wanted to maximize a single-family residence to a multi-family use zone, that caused a tremendous amount of consultation not only to the neighborhood, but the Medford Historical Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=836.195s">Going</a> back, you go to 61 Toro Street, where you had an old magnificent home over there for which Tufts University was involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=843.243s">And</a> they sort of like wanted to take advantage of the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=846.026s">But</a> through the neighborhood pushing back, that didn't take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=850.475s">Right</a> now, as of tomorrow night, you're going to have before the Board of Appeals, where the old Titan gas station is on Boston Avenue and Harvard Street, a condominium proposed development. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=861.519s">And</a> then you have rumored development of a new condos behind the Middlesex Avenue Mall. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=867.522s">Once</a> again, a rumored development of 30 plus condos on South Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=872.784s">And</a> a rumored Boston Avenue multi-housing development. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=878.123s">Then,</a> at the end of last summer, 500 multi-use development was proposed by Combined Properties of Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=887.529s">And</a> after a large community opposition, led by then City Councilor and now Mayor, Lungo-Koehn, as well as Gene Nuzzo and Cheryl Rodriguez, the project was forced to be scrapped by the developer. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=904.521s">Now,</a> some six months later, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=907.52s">This</a> same company, Combined Properties, is now proposing a 37, 378 residential unit, and the application for approval is coming along under a Chapter 40B proposal, entirely different than what they originally had. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=924.773s">The</a> real wake-up call to this whole issue right now on housing here in the City of Medford should have taken place at 61 Locust Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=932.179s">The</a> massive development that is opposite Wegmans right now, which was originally scheduled for over 500 units, and they've culled it down to 345. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=942.412s">Neighborhood</a> protests pushed it back. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=945.033s">But</a> as in any big business development, what did they do? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=949.075s">They</a> went into the neighbors that were pushing back and they bought every single home over there for them to at least come back with $345,000 and still make the money that they're going to be made. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=960.103s">As</a> I said some years ago, and as I said during this past campaign, the City of Medford needs to embark on a moratorium. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=967.685s">A</a> moratorium on its zoning, and more importantly, a complete review of its zoning here in the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=975.207s">And</a> the reason why the moratorium would work <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=978.311s">is</a> because our zoning has not been reviewed for a multitude of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=982.653s">So</a> you're saying to any proposed developer that comes in, I will propose this affordable housing, which is not the same as a Chapter 40B, because remember, affordable housing is something that's compensated in part or given great latitude by state laws, whereas a Chapter 40B is a private independent entity coming in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1004.523s">So</a> sure, they'll give you their affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1007.284s">but</a> they'll back in the cost on the remaining units that are in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1011.186s">So</a> how does that qualify and justify for an affordable housing process? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1015.489s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1016.95s">But</a> also, you should be looking into what they call a growth management proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1023.934s">And</a> the reason why I say that is because we have right here in our own city, a sister city, it's called Malden, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1033.829s">And</a> in 2015, they put a question on the ballot, and their ballot question revolved around what you have been talking about, Councilor Falco, the Malden Hospital, what we're going to do with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1045.737s">The</a> second thing is the Community Preservation Act, what are we gonna do with that as far as open space? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1050.98s">And</a> their third question was the moratorium on high-density, multi-level development. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1057.564s">It</a> won by 71% of the vote, and they had a moratorium, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1063.834s">proposal</a> that passed and it went from January of 2016 to December of 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1068.516s">Now</a> incorporated into that <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1076.522s">was</a> the density of the immediate neighborhood taken into consideration, the height, the number of units, as well as the zoning exemptions that were being challenged. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1087.07s">And</a> as a result of that, they have now, I think if you go to them all, then you can be able to see, if you look at their development office, I don't know if they call it Office of Community Development, they do have a serious situation where they had developers just coming in all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1102.765s">Medford</a> has a serious problem in having a workable business community, a business development community. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1110.249s">Approximately</a> 10.2% of the business in this community is commercial. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1115.171s">Who</a> bears the rest of that brunt? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1117.172s">It's</a> the residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1118.553s">And</a> I know every time when you folks turn around and do your budget, you talk about a residential factor making it the highest or the lowest or whatever it might be, you're still putting the burden <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1127.998s">on</a> the taxpayer who owns his residential home, and you're not taking the exemption for the out-of-state person. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1133.761s">So,</a> with that being said, and if we continue to go on this road, or this, how can you say, this road, so to speak, of not increasing our commercial base, all you're going to do is just going to be commercial, I mean, raising in the future your residential rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1148.628s">Now,</a> after what took place in Malden, and after what took place after that, we can switch ourselves over to the city of,
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1161.081s">You</a> want somebody else to talk?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1164.744s">OK,</a> well, I'm on my last page. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1166.526s">I'm</a> on my last page.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1168.767s">So</a> after Malden, beside Malden, in 2015, the city of Revere, and again in 2018, put that question of a moratorium, high density, multi-use positions over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1179.916s">And</a> their situation over there revolved itself around large scale buildings, traffic, public safety, schools, and roads were going to be at issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1188.163s">And</a> the claims that Revere was not growing geographically, but rather becoming more dense without any economic development is just like what's going on right here in our city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1200.088s">And</a> with that being said, that the challenge for affordable housing in Chapter 40B as we speak today, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1205.43s">would</a> be the luxury of using our at-present zoning laws and skirt around the real issue of reasonably priced housing and rental. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1214.596s">There</a> are two or three companies in the United States that take into effect low-moderate housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1221.3s">Veterans</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1223.098s">middle-income</a> people, but not high-end middle-income people, middle-income people, and that's a determination by a professional. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1229.963s">We</a> don't have that expertise over here, and I know on the ballot here tonight, on our agenda, there's a question regarding Chapter 40B, but if you really look at just Chapter 40B, and you realize that developer is not there to lose money, and he's putting housing in a densely populated area, you're violating all the reasoning of why a neighborhood should be a neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1253.438s">And</a> as a result of that, moratoriums does not have to go on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1257.602s">A</a> moratorium can be placed by this council, by this mayor, or jointly together. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1262.266s">And</a> recognizing the fact, and recognizing the fact, we are a city just as running, allowing housing to be any place and everywhere at any time. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1270.152s">And</a> because of that, that's not good. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1272.054s">That's</a> not healthy for the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1274.136s">As</a> I said before a long time ago, development for the sake of development isn't the best thing that can happen in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1279.58s">We</a> have schools, we have public safety, we have public works. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1282.822s">We</a> have a whole host of issues that taxpayers have to increasingly pay for. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1287.005s">And</a> our best example of that is when they talked about stations landing, that they said at that point in time, that was going to lower our tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1293.909s">Well,</a> the tax rate has never gone down once since station landing. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1297.271s">As</a> a matter of fact, it just continuously goes up. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1300.794s">I'd</a> be more than happy to answer any questions, but I just think it's important to have brought this up, especially for our two new councils, but more importantly for all seven of you, because this administration and you as a new council needs to address issues that basically address these matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1318.0s">They</a> haven't been addressed, and they need to be addressed, and you just can't sit here and say, okay, we'll get to it someday, because someday has already come. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1327.983s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1331.362s">Larry,</a> could you, I made copies of my comments for all of your Councilors, so in case you missed anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1341.869s">The</a> part that I appreciated the most when I served on this board for 36 years was the fact that I was willing to hear opposite viewpoints. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1351.193s">But</a> when it comes to finances, two and two equals four. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1355.534s">And</a> when it comes to neighborhoods, the people who live in the neighborhood should come first. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1360.056s">Not</a> out-of-towners, not developers who want to come in there and make a whole bunch of money and then leave us. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1365.958s">Perfect</a> example is Lumineer on Locust Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1369.139s">They</a> built the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1370.7s">They</a> said they were going to stay there. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1372.201s">They</a> went to the Board of Appeals to get what they had to. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1374.762s">And</a> one year later, they sold off the building and made $62 million at the expense of the Medford taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1382.327s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I thank you for listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1384.868s">And</a> if there's any questions, I'd be more than happy to answer them.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1395.594s">Can</a> I ask a question?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3509.89s">Name</a> and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3517.376s">Robert</a> Penta, 0 Summit Road, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3520.078s">I'm</a> really getting confused on this whole issue right now, because I thought.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3529.065s">Let</a> me just ask this. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3530.526s">Let</a> me ask just one question.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3532.127s">And</a> to me, this is where I would be going with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3535.45s">I'm</a> trying to understand, you're telling me that don't raise the value of land. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3540.412s">And</a> if you don't raise the value of land, you'll have a better neighborhood or a better atmosphere, so to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3546.174s">So</a> with that being taken, taking place, what you're saying is that <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3550.936s">ignore</a> zoning because zoning is a big reason why land values go up and if you are going to take out the free competitive spirit of Somebody buying a piece of property and doing what he wants by ignoring the zoning laws that absolutely exist at the present time whether it be for a chapter 40 B or affordable zoning that flies in the face of <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3573.656s">of</a> what the petition is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3575.978s">And</a> I think what Dr. Starello is basically trying to say, all you're doing is moving the debt from today till tomorrow, and when tomorrow comes, whether it's two today or 10 or 12 or 14, what are you dealing with? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3587.469s">Somebody's</a> gonna wind up paying for it, but in the meantime, it's a cost factor that's being reflected upon everyday taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3594.014s">So</a> when somebody says that the value of land, don't put it on the value of land, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3599.079s">That</a> seems to be the intrinsic value of how developers seem to come into a community, see the value. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3605.281s">They</a> don't care about the location. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3606.821s">They</a> don't care about what the density is going to do with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3609.842s">And</a> it's your zoning that's gonna predicate the value of land and its use of land and neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3615.804s">That's</a> how I read what Councilor Morell just offered. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3619.225s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4953.551s">Barpenta,</a> Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4955.972s">So</a> this is going to reflect back on some of the comments that I made a little bit earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4960.033s">First</a> of all, the City of Medford is a member of the Massachusetts Municipal Association, and they have individuals who are very professional in the housing portion of what we're talking about here right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4971.397s">To</a> go out and hire a private consultant that pushes and advocates for Chapter 40B, I don't think would be a very wise idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4980.424s">Oh,</a> against the 40B. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4981.825s">I</a> thought you said... I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4984.927s">Well,</a> you may not have to do that because if the Office of Community Development gets itself redesigned, hopefully you would have somebody up there who would understand what the process is. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4992.771s">You</a> have to understand something. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4994.152s">There's</a> a difference between Chapter 40B, which does come under a few Massachusetts housing management departments, as compared to affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5004.337s">Affordable</a> housing is usually a private, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5007.779s">But</a> working with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, who to some degree sets some standards up there as it relates to not only affordability, which has to be, but the permanent and perpetuity of having the <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5020.091s">the</a> reduced cost unit, whether it be the rental or whether it be the housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5025.694s">Chapter</a> 40B is made for a private developer. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5029.536s">He'll</a> come in there and say in the city of Medford, well, you've got to get between, your income level has to be 80% of the medium income in the area that you're applying to put the housing in. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5038.642s">And</a> if that be the case, you know, we can do that or we'll put 100 units up. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5044.456s">25,</a> 2025, whatever the number's gonna turn out to be, will be affordable, and we'll just raise the cost on the other end of the units. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5050.54s">So</a> what did you wind up getting? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5052.341s">You</a> really didn't complete anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5055.683s">Me</a> personally, my suggestion would be that the city goes into a complete moratorium on any and all development to take place, because you don't have anything right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5064.228s">You</a> have a Chapter 40B person who can come in, who just came in right now on Mystic Avenue, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5069.591s">and</a> will bypass your height restrictions and other zoning requirements because that's what 40B is allowed to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5075.919s">If</a> you read chapter 69 of chapter 49, excuse me, of chapter 40B, that's what they'll tell you. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5084.229s">They</a> can come in and they detour and they go around. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5086.972s">And</a> I know you guys, Councilor Knight and Councilor Scarpelli, have talked about over the last two or three years, zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5092.296s">So</a> maybe you should hire a zoning consultant right now to figure out how you bring up an update of a 40-year-old zoning that you have here in the city of Medford because every Chapter 40B that comes in here will bypass upstairs and they'll get around it. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5105.606s">And</a> that's the privilege that you have for being a Chapter 40B participant, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5110.589s">So</a> if you want to have a Chapter 40B <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5113.231s">be</a> participant that works with the city, then that's what you need. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5116.813s">You</a> need to have someone who goes into the neighborhood and sees where the project is going and how is it going to enhance. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5122.417s">It's</a> not gonna produce a density buster. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5125.699s">That's</a> what you don't want, and that's what's happening right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5128.281s">Density</a> busting all over the city, because private developers know how to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5132.784s">They're</a> efficient at doing it, they make it sound good, and what do you have left? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5137.387s">You</a> have all these developments all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5140.797s">schools,</a> police, fire, public works, infrastructure, water and sewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5147.159s">It's</a> all affected by this, all affected by this. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5150.44s">And</a> while it might sound good that it looks good, that's what you're paying for in your taxes for which our commercial tax rate can't even handle because it's only a 10%. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5160.664s">So</a> the burden once again is right back onto the residential taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5165.025s">I</a> think it's a great idea to get into the discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5168.442s">But</a> if you read this case after case after case where cities and towns are so sorry that they went into Chapter 40B because it did not turn out to be what it was supposed to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5178.185s">And</a> the fastest way to correct a Chapter 40B problem is to make sure that your zoning speaks for what you want today and for tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5186.767s">It's</a> the financial viability of what a community has to deal with as it relates to a Chapter 40B. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5192.409s">Not</a> affordable housing, it's a Chapter 40B. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5195.029s">They're</a> in two entirely different requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5197.97s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5254.154s">Well,</a> if you go to the city of Somerville, they just went through it for a year and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5257.236s">They</a> stopped, they had a moratorium as it relates to that type of development that took place over there because of what was taking place so fast.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5266.301s">They</a> did nothing for that period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5268.442s">as</a> it relates to multi-use development.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5274.404s">To</a> the best of my, to moratorium, so that means you can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5277.205s">Another</a> point of information.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5290.871s">One</a> of the things that a Chapter 40B does tell you, if they go before a Board of Appeals, if the Board of Appeals feels, this is the term that they use, and it's not a friendly Chapter 40B, that's the term, friendly, they can shoot that down. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5306.196s">Now,</a> what determines to be friendly? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5309.157s">It</a> could be public health, it could be public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5311.678s">Those</a> are the two biggest issues that you'd have going. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5314.879s">Other</a> than being in a residential neighborhood and making it high density, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5318.953s">That's</a> a subjective thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5320.194s">That's</a> all I can tell you. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5322.055s">But</a> if you are going to hire somebody, or Office of Community Development is going to employ somebody, consultant or otherwise, that's the first thing I would address, because you have such archaic laws, you can go to the Board of Appeals right now and come in and make a proposal, and you can't shoot it down, because YDB will allow you to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5343.814s">It's</a> an interesting concept and the city of Medford really needs to address it because you've gone at a fever pitch over the past many years with all kinds of development and there's no checks and balances to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5358.449s">61</a> Locust Street is really the issue that should bring this all to a head. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5362.713s">It</a> should have brought it to a head then when they wanted to put 500 units there. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5366.676s">Okay,</a> and what did they do? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5368.499s">The</a> big developer went in there and bought out the neighborhood, bought out every single house in the neighborhood, and they reduced it to 345, which the Board of Appeals allowed, and it managed to put itself through.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5391.19s">I</a> believe that the reason, I believe Councilor, the reason why the city lost is because the neighborhood agreed to the reduction of $345,000 after they all got bought out. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5401.379s">So</a> our suit was completely moved at that point in time.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5422.466s">But</a> they felt it had zero standing, but also the then mayor at the time refused to give additional money to go forward with the case.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5431.493s">You</a> could have appealed.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5454.052s">But</a> I also believe, Mr. President, when you lost the issue on standing, it was a moot issue, because all the people, the residents, pushed back on the lawsuit, because they all got bought out. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5464.315s">So</a> the standing for which the council had was not being supported by the neighborhood, which initiated the lawsuit in the first place. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5472.076s">And</a> the council got originally $20,000 in the beginning to get the case going.<h2><a href="../2018-02-28_cWHRmg4nTSM/2018-02-28_cWHRmg4nTSM.html">Medford City Council 02/27/18</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2668.477s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2670.351s">Name</a> and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2671.753s">Robert</a> M. Pentez, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of this party. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2675.557s">You</a> know, the world is in a changing state of times right now, and I think what Councilman Marks has introduced is something that could be epidemic anywhere in this country, but it's not the first time. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2685.229s">It's</a> been here before. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2686.69s">You</a> know, you as Councilors, you have a 50 percent voice in the school department budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2691.653s">And</a> if you see something that's not taking place in their budget, for example, under school security, and here's a prime example of what school security is all about, this is the opportunity to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2701.057s">If</a> the school committee knows that the city council is with them and trying to help them, that's a great leadership quality. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2707.501s">And</a> I don't think anybody in any municipal or state or federal capacity should sit back. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2712.043s">If</a> you've got something to say that revolves around security, <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2714.683s">Say</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2715.003s">That's</a> what you're getting paid for. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2716.423s">That's</a> what the people expect from you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2718.924s">With</a> that being said, Mr. President, not only do I think it's a good movement, I think it would be wise, as a suggestion being offered to the school committee, that they review their entire policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2730.526s">And</a> now, knowing that they're going to be having a new superintendent as of June or at the end of May or whatever it might be, if not sooner, whatever the situation might be, here's an opportunity to start to clean house on issues that are really of a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2743.352s">Maybe</a> the gun clip said something. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2746.053s">But</a> the review of the policy is what it's all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2749.533s">People</a> in the building that nobody knows nothing about. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2752.234s">And</a> I think it's a good motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2754.755s">And</a> I would hope the council votes approval.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4471.125s">My</a> name is Robert Pentez, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4474.406s">The</a> stress and anxiety of Clipgate, that's what I call it, Clipgate, has needlessly caused our city an embarrassed showing for collective management when they thought nobody was looking. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4485.85s">Dating</a> back to December 28th, when the ammo clip was first found, <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4490.832s">A</a> cast of characters have become principal components to the investigation, starting with the cleaning company personnel who first found the clip. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4500.034s">We</a> have further parties of interest in the school custodian, Mr. Edwards, the principal at the McGlynn School, Mr. Belson, the school superintendent, the resource officer, Medford police officer, Riccati, Mr. McLaughlin, director of building and grounds, Mayor Burke, and school employees who brought this to the attention of Councilor Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4521.859s">When</a> Councilor Lungo-Koehn notified the police on Thursday, December 15th, of this concern brought to her attention by school employees, the school building was swept on Tuesday, February 20th, according to news reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4535.225s">Thankfully,</a> Breanna Lungo-Koehn and Councilor Marks addressed this matter at their next council meeting with many concerned parents in attendance. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4543.889s">This</a> past Thursday, February 22nd, <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4546.573s">at</a> the Karen Little Theater at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4549.434s">Seven</a> days after Breonna Lungelkorn notified police, the mayor called for a school committee meeting wherein hundreds of Medford citizens, teachers, and administrators attended to discuss the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4561.997s">When</a> Mayor Burke, as chairperson of the school committee, first found out about this matter, and from whom and what did she do, she has yet to disclose that matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4571.714s">While</a> the February 22nd meeting revealed a lot of anger and displeasure as to what the Clipgate incident has caused, it also revealed shortcomings to questions asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4584.843s">One</a> glaring question, and yet to be answered, was, who was the we that decided not to share the info at the outset? <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4593.908s">The</a> Medford Police, under the direction of Chief Sacco, is leading the in-house investigation regarding this incident, as he should. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4601.664s">If</a> the Medford police are good enough to investigate a murder, stolen property, drug dealing, and other crimes within their daily jobs, they now don't need to be upstaged by the mayor and her hiring of her close, personal, and financially rewarding political friend, Martha Coakley. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4620.247s">Mayor</a> Burke, on her own, without any discussion, approval, or vote of record from the school committee, has hired her close personal friend, former Attorney General Martha Coakley, who has contributed $1,000 to Mayor Burke's campaign to do this independent personnel investigation because of this matter as it's reported in the news reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4643.868s">This</a> independent personnel investigation should have no ties nor relationships to any politicians in our cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4652.535s">I</a> ask, where is the transparency to this matter? <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4655.898s">Independent</a> means just what it says. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4659.02s">Free</a> and devoid from any influence, guidance, or counsel of another or others, nor affiliated with or loyal to no one political party, organization, or voter. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4670.767s">Both</a> Mrs. Burke and Mrs. Coakley are both Democrats. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4674.67s">This</a> hiring of Martha Coakley by Mayor Burke is a sole source contract, a contract awarded without competitive bidding. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4684.476s">It</a> directs itself to cronyism, particularly in awarding jobs to friends or trusted colleagues in politics between politicians. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4694.375s">This</a> hiring also prevents presents, excuse me, a serious question as to whether Mayor Burke has violated the state ethics law on the chapter 62. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4704.318s">Massachusetts</a> General Law, Chapter 268A, wherein the law states if a conflict is apparent, or the appearance is a telling sign, then a violation of the law is readily at hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4716.627s">A</a> public employee may not act in a manner that would cause a reasonable person to think that she would show favor toward someone or that she can be improperly influenced. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4728.535s">I</a> stand here not to question the ability or the capability <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4733.222s">of</a> Martha Coakley, but rather the concern of a state ethics conflict of interest, as well as to her individual unspecified cost from her very expensive downtown Boston law firm of Foley and Hogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4748.798s">Mayor</a> Burke's relationship with Martha Coakley has been long and financially rewarding. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4754.15s">I</a> find it interesting that Mayor Burke is now concerned with having an independent personnel investigation, but where is her outside independent audit of the school department if she is so concerned about righting the ship? <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4767.832s">I</a> do not believe we need a very expensive, close, personal, and political friend of the mayor to address Medford's employee personnel policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4777.495s">Medford</a> is a good city with tons of good people in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4781.156s">Let</a> this incident be the thoughtful reminder that when the law is not followed and protocols are not in place, and when city leaders take it upon themselves to make decisions that fly in the face of potential safety and what the law says, <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4797.221s">then</a> all involved, no matter who, as this case has demonstrated, shall be held accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4804.826s">For</a> the truth only has one consequence. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4808.468s">Let</a> no cover-up be worse than the crime itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4812.73s">I</a> would like to conclude by making a correction to a statement I made last Thursday at the school committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4819.743s">At</a> the conclusion of my commentary and in my haste, I misread what I meant to say, and it was as follows, what I meant to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4828.807s">What</a> happened in Florida was horrific, and hopefully we all have learned something here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4834.269s">The</a> people of Medford want action, and as city officials, you owe it to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4839.411s">Now,</a> with that being said, Mr. President, again, <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4843.374s">You</a> folks have been through the whole issue of conflict of interest, whether it be your pay raises or jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4849.616s">This</a> is a very serious matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4852.077s">This</a> hiring of Mrs. Coakley out of the Clear Blue Sky, while this incident is going on, I believe does not speak well for the police investigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4862.041s">I</a> don't think it speaks well for the Medford Police Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4864.722s">They</a> can handle their own investigation, and if it turns out to be <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4867.505s">something</a> on one of their own, they will resolve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4870.128s">If</a> it's something that's resolved here in the building, an employee, it will be resolved internally. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4875.435s">And</a> if the need is to have <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4877.934s">an</a> updated personnel policy that hasn't taken place since this mayor has come into being, well then so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4885.06s">But</a> to hire someone who paid you, strike that, who gave you $1,000 in political contributions, smacks with the theory that this is directly a conflict of interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4897.591s">And</a> this is a sole source contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4899.893s">There</a> was no need for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4901.821s">There</a> was no need to go out with no competition, no bidding on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4905.043s">This</a> wasn't a serious emergency that needed to be done and nobody could be contacted. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4909.825s">So</a> I really think it needs to be reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4912.166s">And</a> I think the city solicitor needs to review it with you council. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4915.067s">I</a> would hope someone on the council would ask that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4918.449s">Why</a> did the mayor go ahead and do it? <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4919.649s">The</a> mayor hasn't even notified you fellas and you yet that she's hired Mrs. Coakley for this particular purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4926.578s">to</a> do this investigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4928.279s">I</a> don't know how much she charges. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4929.819s">People</a> say she charges $500 an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4932.16s">Well,</a> how many hours is she going to go for and how long is this going to go on for? <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4936.022s">The</a> taxpayers of this community need to know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4938.663s">And</a> this issue of her being hired should not be disguised because of this ammo gate that's going on here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4946.106s">They</a> are two separate issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4949.227s">And</a> the mayor needs to respond and answer that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4952.411s">Was</a> she part of the we that made the decision not to disclose the information, dating back as early as December 28th and bringing it up to February 15th when Councilor Longo-Curran brought this to everybody's attention because of people bringing it to her attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4967.842s">You</a> know, if you remember closely what the Chief said when the question was asked of him about the picture with the clip with the gun, because I was the one that asked him, where did you get that picture, Chief? <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4978.45s">And</a> he says he got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4980.046s">from</a> the Director of Buildings and Grounds, Mr. McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4983.468s">So</a> I gave you seven people in the beginning that start this whole thing going that have to be interviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4988.25s">Possibly</a> every single elected official probably should be interviewed and asked a question, because maybe some of you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4993.393s">Maybe</a> some of you have been told something. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4994.954s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4996.115s">But</a> you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4996.895s">It's</a> a very serious incident. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4998.776s">Last</a> Thursday night, up at that high school, there were so many people that were so impassioned as to what they were saying that sometimes it just looked like it might have or it could have gotten out of hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5010.32s">But</a> logic and common sense and calmness has to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5015.043s">We</a> all know now that there is an issue out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5017.585s">We</a> all know that allegedly it was thrown away. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5020.666s">We</a> don't know if it was thrown away, if it was misplaced, somebody took it, somebody got rid of it, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5026.41s">The</a> police report, the police investigation will prove that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5029.912s">But</a> while all that's going on, to hire another paid outside consultant, because that person is a political personal friend of the mayor, <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5040.195s">My</a> God, come on, folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5041.597s">I</a> mean, there's got to be some checks and balances here. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5045.842s">It</a> can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5046.163s">If</a> it looks like a duck and walks like a duck and smells like a duck, it probably is. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5049.647s">Chapter</a> 268A, that's what it says. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5052.03s">You</a> can't give the appearance. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5053.532s">And</a> this definitely not only gives the <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5056.556s">You've</a> got the $1,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5057.697s">You've</a> got the contributions. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5059.377s">And</a> she's not only contributed to this mayor, she's contributed to other mayors and other people in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5065.5s">You</a> can't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5066.721s">That's</a> not being independent. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5069.122s">That's</a> saying pay to play. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5071.303s">And</a> if that's what's going to go on here, then shame on this city and shame on elected officials for allowing this to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5077.026s">And</a> I would hope Mrs. Coakley would give a second thought about this and say, well, while it was nice to be asked, I think it would be better for the city of Medford to find someone <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5086.35s">who</a> has absolutely no connections if they really want to do an independent policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5090.596s">You</a> folks are all part of the Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5092.418s">Municipal</a> Association. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5093.419s">They</a> have a huge department in there to review personnel purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5096.964s">You</a> pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5097.705s">You're</a> a paying member on an annual basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5100.148s">You</a> should have gone to them first. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5102.393s">But</a> to turn around in this situation and disguise it because of what happened with the ammo clip and go out there and hire a Methodist lawyer from one of the most expensive law firms in Boston, and you don't even know what it's going to cost you, it makes no sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5118.5s">I</a> would hope one of you somewhere along here puts a request in to have a report as to how and why she was hired, how much is she getting, and if, in fact, this is a conflict of interest.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5939.413s">If</a> it's hearsay, never mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5944.395s">Can</a> I ask you to amend the resolution that reads, well, maybe you don't like it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5950.456s">You</a> can leave if you're bored. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5952.777s">Maybe</a> you can ask the question that <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5955.815s">You're</a> concerned about the ethics of it because of the fact of the financial contributions she has made to the mayor, and that in and of itself presents a conflict of interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5966.517s">The</a> appearance of a conflict of interest, that's what 268A says. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=5973.018s">That's</a> what we're asking for.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=6079.932s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=6080.813s">Mr.</a> President, just as a point of reference, on February 23rd it was written in the Boston Herald and where the mayor is quoted as saying that Martha Coakley is now an employee being hired.<h2><a href="../2017-01-06_q5wtGZ49X-w/2017-01-06_q5wtGZ49X-w.html">Medford, MA City Council - Dec. 20, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3167.715s">My</a> name is Robert Penta zero summit road, Medford mass, former member of this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3172.318s">And</a> if I was sitting on this side of the rail tonight, I'd be making the same proposal that I want to say to it this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3177.836s">I've</a> been following this story now for a few days, and it's been evident over the last three days in the Boston Herald. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3184.22s">There's</a> a story regarding a young man. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3185.761s">His</a> name is DJ Simons. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3188.202s">He's</a> a Boston police officer, 28 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3191.684s">He</a> is the unsung hero. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3192.825s">He</a> is the forgotten man in the Boston Marathon story. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3197.167s">And</a> what I would like to propose and ask you as Medford City Councilors to do on behalf of our city, knowing that we have that great monument out there for the Crystal Campbell Peace Garden, <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3207.313s">that</a> represents our city, who recognizes in times of tragedy, we do stand to the occasion. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3213.735s">We</a> put our political principles aside, and we do unify amongst ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3219.097s">This</a> gentleman, 28 years old, was hit by a bomb, pipe bomb, four days after the incident that took place at the Boston Marathon. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3227.96s">He</a> was one of the first officers on the scene. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3230.461s">And</a> as a result of that, he received a head injury. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3233.022s">And</a> he died subsequently one year later. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3235.543s">And</a> as a result of that, <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3237.553s">His</a> mother, Roxanne Simons, and father, who lived down in the Cape, were never notified of this story called Patriots Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3245.916s">They</a> called up the producers, Peter Berg, Mark Wahlberg, and they have yet to receive a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3252.339s">Fellow</a> Boston police officers are aware of what took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3257.901s">A</a> state representative up on Beacon Hill named Tim Whelan <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3262.032s">made</a> an application to the, um, the board of the directors and the film director, uh, for, uh, Patriot's day and asked them if they would consider doing a post script somehow of putting it in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3274.455s">Never</a> got a response back. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3276.675s">The</a> part that was hurting and disturbing according to Mrs. Simons is the fact that when they can't at the end of the movie, the postscripts of the movie had the four pitches and the four names of the folks that we have in our peace garden. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3288.998s">But</a> Mr. Simon's name was, was not there. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3291.722s">This</a> gentleman is 28 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3293.422s">He's</a> a college graduate. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3295.143s">And</a> subsequently, on graduating college, he went to the Boston Police School to become a Boston police officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3300.424s">He</a> was originally stationed in Brighton, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3302.904s">But</a> he was more of wanting to be not a Boston police officer who hands out tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3307.145s">He</a> wanted to get into the inner city youth, and that's where he did. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3310.546s">He</a> went into the inner city youth where the problems were, and he loved it. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3314.467s">He</a> was a good police officer, loved by many policemen, and loved by his community. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3320.534s">He</a> unfortunately has not even received any kind of recognition throughout this whole program called Patriot's Day, which is a great movie if you want to look at it like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3329.561s">And</a> as they do say, sometimes there are some errors and there's some slips to get through. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3334.365s">But</a> they were notified well in advance, and they're still notified as of now, that maybe to have him recognized as being an unsung hero who died, unfortunately, one year after the tragedy. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3345.573s">He</a> was one of the first people, one of the first people <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3348.175s">of</a> Boston police responders to Watertown Mass on the night of that incident. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3353.017s">Mr.</a> President, all my council colleagues, you folks do many resolutions for many people, whether they are for sports, whether they are for someone who might have passed away, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3365.083s">But</a> for the family of this police officer, I think it would be outstanding that this Medford City Council recognizes the fact that this gentleman, DJ Simons, <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3375.402s">who</a> didn't get recognized, is recognized by the city of Medford, its city government. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3381.123s">For</a> the gentleman did give his life. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3382.924s">He</a> did respond and he was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3386.125s">And</a> for his parents not to have any recognition to that at all, it's just not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3390.966s">And</a> I don't think it's fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3392.706s">So</a> I ask of you, seven of you collectively, for one of you to offer the resolution, or if jointly, to send a note of condolences and of appreciation and of thanks to the Simons family, thanking them for their sons. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3405.776s">efforts</a> as a result of the Boston Marathon. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3409.018s">And</a> maybe there is something, somehow, some way, a plaque of postscript can find its way to that Peace Garden as well here in the city of Medford to let the entire world, to let the entire people know and to let the Simons family know that the city of Medford will not forget and they're most appreciative of what their son did. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3428.033s">So</a> I offer, I ask one of you to come forward and do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3431.815s">Mayor</a> Marty Walsh of Boston, as of today's paper, <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3435.683s">has</a> he himself has taken it upon himself to seek out through the producers and the directors of that show who have refused, I shouldn't say refused, who have yet to respond back to him to have him included. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3447.709s">What</a> the reason is, nobody knows. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3450.29s">But</a> it's a known fact, it is a known fact that that gentleman died in the line of duty protecting the citizens, doing his job as a police officer in behalf of the citizens of this commonwealth and the citizens of Boston and for the people who participated in that Boston Marathon.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=157.352s">My</a> name is Robert Petter, a former member of this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=159.603s">When</a> I was reviewing the offering by Councilor Knight this evening, my question, I think, presents itself in a different direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=166.528s">I</a> mean, we've spent over $14.5 million for a brand new building. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=170.552s">It's</a> obvious that certain departments are understaffed. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=173.714s">And</a> this may be a good way to look at actually what is going on in the highway department as it relates to men, the equipment that they have, and everything that's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=183.382s">And</a> the fact that if this is going to be, I think, is your intent to create another department? <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=188.245s">Is</a> that what you said, Councilor Knight? <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=190.153s">stand</a> alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=190.773s">I</a> don't know if that's a contractual obligation that has to be negotiated through the union. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=194.534s">I</a> mean, it presents itself with a whole bunch of issues, but the best part of the issue I think is this, that I think the council really needs to take a look and see as to what's going on over there, the highway department or the public works building. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=205.678s">I</a> mean, I don't really know if you have a director or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=207.598s">He</a> was on a three months on trial basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=209.979s">It</a> ended in March. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=210.879s">I</a> don't know if they're still advertising for a new director's position. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=213.911s">But</a> I think it would be beneficial if he was here tonight to discuss the matter.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=224.759s">Is</a> that public knowledge that he's been? <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=226.18s">I</a> mean, are you councillors aware of the fact that he's been appointed? <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=230.263s">Pardon</a> me? <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=231.604s">Well,</a> this is the problem of not getting information out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=235.788s">I</a> mean, some councillors know, some don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=237.749s">I,</a> as a public person, don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=239.01s">And</a> I try to stay on top of what's going on here in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=241.836s">But</a> more importantly, just getting back to this issue in particular, my suggestion would be, and if I was on your side of the rail, I would suggest that if we're going to be looking at this, maybe we should be looking at all the departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=252.561s">And</a> if this, in fact, is a union type of job, and this is contractual, I believe the membership themselves have to vote on this as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=260.205s">So</a> while it sounds good, I just think it needs to be researched, and I think it's the best time to look at the whole offering in the Department of Public Works.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1252.13s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1252.71s">Good</a> evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1253.15s">Please</a> state your name and address. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1254.31s">My</a> name is Bob Penta, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1256.831s">I'm</a> a member of the cyclist body. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1258.531s">You</a> know, one of the things that I think is a concerning point is while the meeting might be held tomorrow night, it's not really being held where the public can actually see it and view it. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1267.133s">There</a> are a lot of people who might like to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1269.003s">and</a> just can't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1269.824s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1270.565s">We</a> don't have any public access, so that's another two points against us. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1274.929s">But</a> more importantly, I think some of these proposed changes and discussions that take place stand to be corrected, go back to 2004 and then 2008. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1284.117s">And</a> for them to be sitting in the committee for a long period of time such as that with no intent to either add or subtract to them or eliminate them, <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1292.78s">In</a> the being brought up now you know is of a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1296.423s">You</a> have some concerns in here relative toward open public forums and public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1304.648s">And</a> if you read it the way it's being written unless the words are going to be changed someone's going to have to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1311.467s">at</a> six o'clock at night if they want to talk on the subject matter before the council, and then if they want to talk... Point of clarification, Mr. President, and this is why I'd rather not have this conversation now, because the paper still hasn't been presented.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1335.604s">Right,</a> and that's why we're going to discuss this all tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1338.746s">But,</a> Mr. President, with all due respect, <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1340.458s">If</a> this is the report that came out, an eight-page report, okay, and it's Councilor Longo-Curran and it's Councilor Marksley's alluded to, it would have been nice to have it highlighted. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1348.041s">It</a> did take some time to go review it. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1350.382s">Then</a> why not discuss this right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1353.604s">What's</a> being, what's wrong with, we're talking about highlights. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1356.685s">That's</a> all we're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1358.066s">And</a> these are important points for people to maybe want to come tomorrow night and understand what's going on.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1403.784s">But</a> I believe, Mr. President, this was came out of committee in August. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1407.485s">This</a> is now October. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1408.946s">So</a> there was a few months lag in between. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1411.767s">And</a> now you're asking your honorable body to review this in a matter of a few days. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1415.749s">Eight</a> pages, very small, minuscule print. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1419.036s">But</a> that's not the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1419.957s">The</a> fact of the matter is this involves the taxpayers of this community.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1438.336s">We're</a> going to discuss this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1442.398s">No,</a> that's not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1443.18s">I</a> don't think it's the Committee of the Whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1444.823s">It's</a> been referred to a Committee of the Whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1446.748s">And</a> since you're referring something to the Committee of the Whole, are you telling me that all seven of you? <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1450.947s">are</a> going to be afraid to discuss it before tomorrow night, to let the taxpayers know some of the issues that are on the agenda, Mr. President, that they might want to come.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1460.549s">It's</a> on your agenda for tomorrow night.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1471.271s">That's</a> the issue at point, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1474.852s">There</a> are some very salient points here that operate against the taxpayer <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1479.713s">coming</a> to this podium when they would like to speak on a subject matter more than once. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1485.294s">Also</a> suspension of the rules as an issue more than once. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1489.035s">And</a> we can go through this if you want to, page by page. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1491.456s">That's</a> not my intent. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1492.776s">My</a> intent is to talk about some highlights that directly affect any taxpayer in this audience to come up here and have an opportunity to speak like right now, which a new rules is promulgated. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1503.899s">They</a> will not, if it's voted upon by this body, you won't be able to do it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1522.969s">Well,</a> my remarks that I would like to wrap up, Mr. President, is the fact that on tomorrow night you're going to be discussing things that are going to restrict council. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1531.154s">I</a> mean, citizen participation at this podium on more than one occasion. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1534.896s">It's</a> done three deliberate <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1536.863s">If</a> the council so votes, there's going to be three opportunities where a citizens will not be able to do what's taking place here right now, coming up and speaking on something, whether it's on the agenda or suspension of the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1548.838s">And</a> then the craziness of saying that the craziness of saying that is not wrap it up, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1554.045s">And</a> the craziness of saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1555.847s">that</a> if one Councilor chastises another one, he has to be scolded by whoever the president is, and apologize, and he won't be able to speak until the apology takes place. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1566.216s">What</a> are we talking about here? <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1567.357s">This</a> is child's play. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1568.578s">This</a> is going to be discussed in the Committee of the Whole, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1570.919s">Well,</a> these are part of the rules that are being promulgated. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1572.861s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1859.722s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1861.464s">Just</a> a quick point of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1863.625s">It's</a> not on the city's website. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1865.093s">And</a> for the folks who have found out today, it was a citizen taxpayer who put it on a Facebook page, and that's how people became aware of it, because they couldn't get the gut of what this whole thing was about on the city's webpage. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1878.26s">Thank</a> you, sir.<h2><a href="../2025-03-18_2SyhnAlrcqY/2025-03-18_2SyhnAlrcqY.html">Medford, MA City Council - Oct. 4, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3699.245s">Hope</a> to see you all there.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4227.518s">Good</a> evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4228.058s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4228.499s">Please</a> state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4230.319s">My</a> name is Robert Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4231.279s">I</a> live at zero summit road, former member of the Sargas party. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4234.62s">Uh,</a> let's take a reflect back on what council car viola just indicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4237.82s">Uh,</a> having served on the council with your folks before it was on a couple of occasions that he pressed for the issue regarding a report forthcoming forthcoming forthcoming regarding this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4248.413s">The</a> last one that I seem to have that's available is dated December 4th of 2015, with a breakdown which does not include December of last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4258.335s">And</a> it's a little bit perplexing as it relates to, number one, the citations that were appealed, which were something like 3,054 year-to-date, and the citations that were dismissed, which was 1,375. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4270.198s">So</a> almost 45 percent of the citations that were issued up until November of last year were dismissed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4277.273s">but</a> then you go to the issue regarding strike that hearings and year to date there was 240 hearings and of those year to date hearings, I think 88 of them were dismissed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4289.899s">The</a> issue I think revolves around a whole host of contingencies on with this new pay to park, you can use your phone and what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4298.443s">Since</a> there is a new owner out there, I have seen certain problems that have existed personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4303.486s">Yale</a> Street parking lot, people in the lot after six o'clock at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4306.905s">giving</a> out tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4308.366s">Other</a> parts of the city, the new people that have come on board with this new company, and I don't know who they are because you guys don't have a contract, you should have a copy of the contract as amended, should indicate that these folks should be aware as to what they're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4323.092s">Also,</a> the fact that you can't go out there, these folks are supposed to be identified with a tag on them, with a face on their ID card, so to speak, and not something that's hidden behind their jacket or what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4337.282s">and</a> I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4338.743s">The</a> other thing, and it's a concern, it's a bone of contention that I've had since day one, we were told during the last mayoral campaign by this mayor that seniors would be able to park for nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4348.208s">What</a> you have now is if a senior wants to park in the city, that senior has to pay $25 to have the opportunity to park for nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4355.651s">They</a> get a card or whatever it might be, and they can't transfer it to another car, because if you're a senior, and you happen to be 65, that's what they use for a standard, and 62 is social security age, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4366.73s">So</a> why it's 65 to be a senior, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4369.572s">But</a> if you get this little placard or whatever it might be, or sticker, you can't transfer it to another car. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4374.336s">So</a> if you're a senior driving in the city and your car is either broken down and you wanna use another car, because you are a senior, you should be able to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4382.742s">So</a> the requirement doesn't go to the senior, apparently it goes to the car and you're stuck to that particular car. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4388.647s">I</a> think that really needs to be reviewed and looked upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4391.389s">But</a> more importantly, I just think the statistical analysis should be forthcoming <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4395.935s">You</a> folks had asked for a monthly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4397.956s">The</a> last time you got it was eight months into the, nine months into the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4401.918s">It</a> just doesn't seem right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4403.239s">My</a> suggestion would be to have you have the new people, just like you had a Republic when they first come in, have them come and appear before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4411.383s">Air</a> your differences with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4412.684s">Let</a> them explain to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4414.144s">Let</a> them explain to the public what the changes might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4417.246s">You</a> know, it's kind of hard, you know, when people call up and they ask, you know, what can we do? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4421.328s">How</a> do we make this thing better? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4424.009s">Lady</a> comes to city hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4425.638s">thinking</a> that she can pay her ticket here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4427.679s">She</a> can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4428.339s">And</a> while she's here trying to pay the ticket, she's outside and she's getting a ticket on her car. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4432.64s">And</a> she's coming in here thinking this is the way you're supposed to pay the ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4435.541s">You</a> go down the street to go to pay the ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4437.701s">And</a> then, oh, too bad, you can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4439.382s">You've</a> got a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4440.462s">You</a> stayed here too long. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4441.703s">There's</a> a whole host of issues that are still <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4443.572s">surrounding</a> this whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4444.913s">They're</a> into the neighborhoods, where resident parking takes place, and late at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4449.695s">These</a> things are just multiplying, and nothing seems to be getting better. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4452.716s">And</a> if you speak to some of the business people in the square, in all the squares, they'll basically tell you that there are more spots open now than there were before. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4460.119s">That's</a> great, but their business isn't getting any much better than it was before. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4463.921s">If</a> anything, it's getting less. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4465.942s">So</a> the only reprieve that was really given during this past year is when the mayor was in, Mayor McGlynn was here, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4471.825s">And</a> I guess he worked out a deal with Republic at that time, during the holidays, from November 4th to, I believe, January 3rd, that on the weekends, you didn't have to pay to use the meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4481.27s">But</a> that seems to be something that's not being worked out right now by this company. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4485.332s">I</a> don't know what they're going to do for the holidays this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4487.734s">It's</a> a new company. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4488.454s">They're</a> new in town. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4489.635s">But</a> I strongly suggest that you have them before you, rather than having these piecemeal approaches of people with concerns and complaints, because you really need to take a look at the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4499.08s">You</a> really need to know what they're doing in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4501.717s">And</a> Councilor Lungo-Koehn is right, asking for that because I think the time is near. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4505.818s">Your</a> holidays are right around the corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4512.64s">Any</a> questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4513.44s">Be</a> more than happy to answer them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4514.96s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4515.4s">Nice</a> to see you all smiling tonight. <a

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11134.786s">My</a> name is Robert Pentez, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11137.469s">I'm</a> a member of the Saugus body. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11139.455s">You</a> know, during this past campaign for the mayor's office, the term that the president and mayor used was partners in progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11145.538s">And</a> partners in progress doesn't seem to be the staple that took place during this particular budgetary season. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11151.282s">As</a> Councilor Lungo-Koehn has alluded to, if you only got three minutes of the mayor and the initial presentation of a budget, and then you had to fend for yourself after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11159.866s">And</a> I think one of the comments, and I don't know what councilor made it, that many, many questions were asked more this year than ever before. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11166.64s">This</a> probably is a result of the answers worth forthcoming. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11169.221s">That's</a> why you ask so many questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11171.402s">But</a> a few of the things that I'd like to highlight, and this particular budget starts going back to a year ago, when this former budget was being presented by Louise Miller. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11180.146s">The</a> question was asked of her twice, and it was by myself, when Mr. Scarpelli, Council Counsel Scott Scarpelli is sitting, would you present the budget in the same way it has been presented? <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11188.83s">And</a> she said no. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11190.031s">And</a> we went through the idea of presenting the budget that had <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11193.262s">a</a> wish list of a cost analysis of each and every department had bringing forth that for which they wanted. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11199.444s">Now</a> you didn't get it this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11200.645s">And</a> unfortunately, why? <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11201.585s">I</a> don't know, because you have the same mayor who was the former budget director who relinquished that position to give it to Louise mill, who presented the budget, who indicated to you at that point in time that you would be getting hopefully a budget that would handle the request of the council that you didn't get. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11216.07s">But</a> I guess we're talking about old school and it just didn't come to fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11220.093s">So</a> some of the things that I would be concerned about if I was still sitting on your side would be a new police station, something that you, Councilor De La Ruza, alluded to some three to four years ago as the number one priority of the Medford City Council, a brand new police station for the police officers of this city and for the safety and the concern of the citizens of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11238.74s">Absolutely</a> no discussion about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11241.301s">It</a> was a bone of contention during this past campaign. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11244.182s">President's</a> administration says it would be a minimum of seven years out. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11247.667s">And</a> we all know right now what's going on in that police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11250.208s">You</a> know, it's rat infested. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11252.209s">It</a> has mold in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11253.569s">It</a> has police officers that are sick. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11255.39s">And</a> it just cannot accommodate the everyday needs of a modern society, a police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11261.952s">You</a> know, just a little real quick, when you talked about the box lunches for the workers on Election Day, it's interesting where the mayor found the money to have the mayor's office done completely over. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11272.336s">But</a> we can't find the money to take care, unfortunately, the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11275.417s">who</a> work on a daily basis, once a year or twice a year, depending on the primary and the final elections that take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11282.302s">You</a> know, I think it's a service, minimal as it might be, that they deserve something having. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11287.165s">I</a> haven't heard anybody talk about the fact that, I know there's approximately $20,000 in the budget that the mayor is required to put in, and she has to pay the entire cost of what you folks have hired an outside attorney to bring the 61 Locust Street issue to bear in hand, but nobody's talked about <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11304.227s">which</a> has been on the council agenda for many years, of looking at a new fire station on Riverside Avenue and possibly looking at a satellite fire station that sits on the opposite side of Wellington Station, where the station landing is, where the new development of 200 more units are going up, which are right opposite the Wellington Station, plus the whole commercial industrial area over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11325.943s">And</a> I think that's something that really needs to be addressed, over and beyond the fact that if you look at your budget, <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11331.445s">In</a> this year's budget, your fire department overtime money was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11336.788s">But</a> once again, on the annual basis, on the police department side, their overtime money wasn't there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11341.992s">It</a> has to be transferred each and every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11344.573s">Now</a> that's a serious question to ask, because they range anywhere from $400,000 to $600,000 a year in overtime, where the fire department has their money in overtime built right in. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11354.68s">Why</a> that happens in the police department, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11357.141s">But</a> if you want a true and accurate accounting of what overtime costs, <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11360.169s">or</a> projected overtime costs, that money should be definitive right in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11365.53s">Also,</a> you built a new $14.1 million Department of Public Works building. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11370.391s">It's</a> understaffed, and you don't have the right equipment to do all the jobs that are necessary on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11375.852s">Right</a> now, you're dealing with an interim temporary supervisor, a director of the building over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11382.574s">I</a> just don't know where it's going. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11384.474s">And</a> a lot of this click it, fix it idea of what are being asked to be fixed, <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11389.217s">are</a> being mocked off as being completed, and they haven't even been addressed, they haven't even been resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11393.758s">And</a> why these things are being resolved through the Department of Public Works, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11397.76s">If</a> somebody's making a mistake or it's an error, for whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11402.101s">Also,</a> you talked about, Councilman Marks, you also alluded to the fact that $400,000 from the water and sewer on the school department and the city side is basically borne by the taxpayers of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11412.804s">You</a> know, it's an interesting analysis because many years ago, when we were talking about the new INI that was coming in, <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11418.88s">and</a> we were doing High Street, and the MWRA was in here putting in new water lines, especially at the intersection of Governor's Avenue and High Street, there was a project cost in that particular area of quite a few dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11433.064s">I</a> forget the exact amount, so I won't lead it to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11435.785s">But</a> part of the mitigation that took place as a result of that is they had to do High Street, I believe from Medford Square, a little bit past CVS, <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11444.865s">to</a> do that street over as part of the mitigation for the cost of putting these two things in there, relining the street and making the connections right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11453.472s">As</a> a matter of fact, I think it was right out in front of Carlings where the sewer just fell into the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11458.356s">And</a> I think a lady got hurt, and that was precipitous of what took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11462.539s">But</a> the $400,000 is just a drop in the bucket to the $8.5 million that's presently sitting <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11467.767s">and</a> the water and sewer account, you know, and what major projects do you have lined up where those monies can be expended? <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11475.011s">I</a> mean, I didn't hear it, I didn't see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11476.631s">I</a> think last week there was a conversation with some folks on looking at cities and, I mean, streets to be done, and I believe Evans Street was one of them that they were talking about, and I believe the comment was that we'll be getting to the water and sewer portion of it, but we probably won't get to the paving of it until next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11493.62s">I</a> just hope that this council is not getting buffaloed <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11496.114s">and</a> to passing a budget that's not taking an understanding into what streets are going to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11501.258s">And</a> then all of a sudden next year, in election year, all these streets decided to get done. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11505.48s">And</a> a major cost is going to come out. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11507.582s">And</a> maybe this is what this whole capital improvement program is going to be all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11510.984s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11511.825s">But</a> it's not fair for the people who have been waiting year in and year out, waiting for their street to be done, waiting for their manholes on their street to be fixed, waiting for their sidewalks to be taken care of, waiting for their tree stumps to be removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11524.41s">And</a> the number that you were given a few weeks ago is absolutely wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11527.212s">There's</a> many more than two to three to 400 tree stumps that are out there that need to be corrected and taken care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11533.036s">You</a> also, um, and in the last election, we talked about the CPA, whether you were for it or against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11540.3s">And</a> here you are in June, almost seven months later, and there's still no definitive program. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11545.664s">There</a> is still nothing out there to tell the people what that money is going to be used for and when it's going to be used. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11550.654s">And</a> if you look at the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, they don't even know if they're going to be able to fund it this year, because they're behind on revenues and revenue projections that they had anticipated coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11559.9s">So</a> the people of this community have to have an understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11562.261s">If</a> you voted for the CPA for the 1.5%, I believe that's what they voted for, as the override on your taxes, over and beyond your taxes, which to me is an end run of Proposition 2.5, but that's nearly over there, you're still going to be funding the whole thing on your own. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11575.45s">And</a> you're not going to be getting that for which you thought the match was going to be from the state, because they just don't have the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11580.57s">And</a> unfortunately, you're stuck with it for five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11583.251s">But</a> I think I believe that it's in Councilor Knight's committee that you're working on, the ad hoc committee, and waiting to make a finality of where it's going to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11594.813s">And</a> hopefully, the recommendation will come out, and people will have an opportunity to discuss it, and you can get a feeling of where you're going to be going. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11604.855s">There's</a> been absolutely no upgrading. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11606.905s">On</a> the antiquated cable casting of this council chamber, what transmits over cable television, whether it be Comcast or Verizon. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11614.688s">Verizon</a> seems to have a better signal going out rather than Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11618.229s">This</a> building hasn't been touched for well over 30 years, and I would suggest that you do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11622.45s">And</a> then you have an excess of the cable access money, an excess of $550,000 just sitting there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11629.913s">And</a> it's never been done, and it's never been done to be used to correct this particular building over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11637.118s">There's</a> a whole bunch of things that you folks have been getting into. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11640.44s">One</a> of the things I want to compliment the council on, and you took the bull by the horns for the last couple of weeks, is the Locust Street project. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11648.066s">That's</a> 61 Locust Street, 490 unit project on Locust Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11651.929s">I</a> compliment you publicly because it really is an issue that is disturbing to the neighborhood and it'll destroy the entire fabric, not only of the Wellington neighborhood, it has an immediate impact on the entire city of Medford, if in fact that were to come to fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11665.688s">Without</a> going through all the particulars and all the facts that are relegated to it, I thank you for taking that position and voting seven to nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11672.694s">Very</a> rare do you get seven to nothing vote on something like this, but you did the right thing on this particular- You have one minute, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11677.499s">Pardon</a> me?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11678.76s">You</a> did the right thing as it relates to this particular subject matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11683.624s">I</a> just want to conclude probably by saying that I would hope you have a new budget director coming on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11692.131s">has</a> been here for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11693.432s">I</a> happen to like Anne, and I think she does a good job, and I think she's a very honest person. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11697.334s">But</a> I think she was put in a very tough situation as it relates to presenting not only the budget before you folks, but before the Medford City Council and city government. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11705.919s">So</a> I thank you for your efforts, Anne. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11708.28s">But</a> more importantly, I would just hope this council gets its act together by demanding from this mayor that before any budget comes forward, before any capital improvement comes forward, she sits down with you personally, not an emissary, <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11720.43s">When</a> in fact, she did have a representative who was supposed to be your council emissary. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11724.171s">She's</a> not here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11725.451s">They're</a> never here. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11726.171s">Unfortunately,</a> you have to do this on your own and vote on it on your own. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11729.732s">So</a> once again, I thank you for listening to my comments and at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11745.916s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11747.136s">I</a> just want to thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11748.417s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11749.317s">Without</a> calling you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_2MzH8zDWQL0/2025-03-21_2MzH8zDWQL0.html">Medford, MA City Council - June 21, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3901.807s">My</a> name is Robert Penter, I live at Zero Summit Road, former member of the Sarkis party. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3905.929s">I</a> want to thank Mr. Reid for coming forward here, because I think he's bringing to the attention of our public the fact that our streets and the needs of our streets, whether they be sidewalks, whether they be curbings, whether they be the underground infrastructure, is in a desperate need of, how can you say, a revisiting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3923.537s">You</a> folks haven't seen this, and not to digress, but I will digress, going back to last year during the campaign, this was a big issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3930.461s">People</a> in this community are very concerned about their streets, the potholes in their streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3935.645s">The</a> people are not getting any response back. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3938.507s">I</a> mean, the city now signs on to this quote, unquote, complete streets program. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3944.311s">Do</a> a street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3945.372s">Get</a> a street done. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3946.793s">Don't</a> get it to the point that it is right now that people are coming up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3950.696s">And</a> I know there's going to be another gentleman that's going to come up here and he's going to talk about <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3954.697s">a</a> street that the city owns that they haven't done that was part of a $14.4 million project. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3960.058s">And</a> it just doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3962.139s">You</a> know, the council has asked, and you, acting president Marks, you would ask for an annual monthly go along to see where the budget's going. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3972.301s">And</a> I think last year Louise Miller said, she said it twice, right here at this podium, she would have never presented the budget the way it's been, as it's been in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3980.434s">and</a> she would put your wish list in there, and she would show the cost and where and how it would go. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3985.136s">Well,</a> I think you folks do have an obligation as city councilors, because I know I accepted it when I sat on that side of the rail, to have monthly meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3992.679s">So</a> have meetings with your department heads to find out exactly what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3997.181s">The</a> rumor around this building that the city engineer, she's on a six-month to a one-year review for her job performance. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4003.624s">True</a> or false or indifferent, I don't know, but that's the rumor running around the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4007.779s">But</a> whether it's a rumor or not, the fact of the matter is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4011.204s">The</a> streets in this city are in desperate need of not only repair, but a review. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4015.75s">The</a> public works department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4019.216s">Their</a> short chains would help, but at the same time, their direction is not being geared into the purpose of what it's there for. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4026.121s">What's</a> the most important thing that's affecting this community right now on a daily basis? <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4031.365s">All</a> of a sudden, they just got through painting the stripes, the crosswalks and the stripes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4036.428s">School</a> is out and the stripes are done. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4038.25s">This</a> should have been done when school was in. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4040.771s">Prime</a> time of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4041.772s">It</a> used to be done twice a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4042.973s">It</a> used to cost $60,000 a year when Mayor McGlynn was here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4046.215s">Now</a> he's only been out a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4047.156s">$60,000</a> a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4048.92s">paint</a> the crosswalks and the stripes, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4051.184s">Twice</a> a year, it's a public safety issue, why not? <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4053.87s">But</a> look at your streets, look at your sidewalks, look at your curbing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4057.757s">Mr.</a> Reed brought, I think, some excellent points forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4061.178s">not</a> to sit here and advocate for him to be an employee of the city, but he did work for this city, and he did do a good job, and he did bring these attentions to the engineering department, and we're still talking about him. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4071.601s">After</a> the fact, still talking about him. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4074.102s">It's</a> just symptomatic on how this entire administration operates. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4077.864s">After</a> the fact, no public acknowledgement, and this council, you know, I don't know what this mayor thinks of this council, but it's quite obvious. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4085.508s">She</a> doesn't have you in high regards at all, because you folks have absolutely no idea as to what's going on outside this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4092.474s">You</a> do the best you can. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4093.755s">You</a> read it in the newspaper. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4094.956s">You</a> talk amongst yourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4096.963s">But</a> unfortunately, if this city keeps going in the direction it's going, it'll have no direction to go in. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4101.745s">It's</a> going to be out of control. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4103.426s">And</a> it is out of control right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4105.287s">Locust</a> Street is the best example of telling you what's happening in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4109.569s">An</a> out-of-control situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4111.43s">Just</a> think of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4112.25s">You</a> folks had to go hire your own attorney to sue the Board of Appeals. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4116.352s">and</a> for which this mayor thought this was a great project here in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4119.695s">It's</a> going to add a wonderful new neighborhood and we're excited about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4124.038s">We</a> are so excited about it, it's going to cost you hundreds and thousands of dollars because now the council is going to sue your board of appeals that your city solicitor has to defend. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4132.986s">And</a> the neighbors have to go out and get their lawyer for they have to pay for it because they're not going to get pushed around by city hall who never asked them to be part of it or to be included. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4142.393s">It's</a> like a bad street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4144.074s">If</a> you don't fix it, it gets worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4146.595s">Well,</a> it's the public relations of this administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4149.496s">It's</a> worse now than it was when it started, and it's not getting any better. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4153.097s">And</a> I would hope that this Medford City Council puts its foot down and tells this mayor that before you do anything and go forward, we want to be a part of it, and our city streets, we want to be a part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4164.581s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_hFAk--zIv7g/2025-03-21_hFAk--zIv7g.html">Medford, MA City Council - June 14, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

of the zoning of this city of Medford, not the board of appeals, because that's what they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4719.607s">People</a> go to them on an appeal. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4721.008s">But</a> you folks, you write the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4724.048s">The</a> zoning begins and ends here, goes through whatever the process might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4728.549s">So</a> you have every right to not only appeal this decision, <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4731.632s">but</a> to appeal it as loudly and as strongly as you can. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4735.273s">On</a> page five of the decision, the commentary says it completes the zoning, the industrial zoning, except for heightened use. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4745.116s">Now,</a> this is an industrial piece of property, which is allowed to have certain exemptions that you don't have. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4752.017s">But</a> the heightened use relegates itself to the multiple dwelling portion. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4758.48s">We</a> can go back to 1988. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4759.381s">There</a> was a company called Asano and White. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4762.023s">They</a> did a, I think it was a $70,000, $80,000 report here in the city of Medford as it reflects upon housing, development, traffic impact, and water and sewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4772.57s">And</a> the Wellington Glenwood area was one of the particular areas that they did it on. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4777.674s">And</a> Councilman Marks alluded to the fact on page eight, the topography of the land. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4781.937s">The</a> board says that a substantial part of the property, if it's not developed with multiple dwelling, <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4789.03s">In</a> the ordinance, the industrial zone, in essence, will become inoperative because it'll just stay industrial and you can't do anything with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4796.497s">I</a> think there's one point that hasn't been said thus far, unless somebody else wants to say it later on. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4801.242s">Don't</a> forget, when these folks came on March 31st and before that, they didn't say no to the development. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4806.226s">They</a> were conciliatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4807.828s">They</a> said, reduce the size of the project, make it smaller if you can, and I think the people could live with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4814.117s">But</a> that didn't take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4815.757s">If</a> you read the decision regarding 7 Canal Street, the very last paragraph, as written by the board, basically says, and I read it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4827.879s">It's</a> kind of interesting, that decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4829.94s">It</a> says the following, in conclusion, the board is hopeful that the developer will reconsider the size and scope of the proposed apartment building. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4838.161s">There</a> is much to commend the overall project in such close proximity to public transportation <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4843.469s">including</a> the commuter rail. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4845.59s">Now,</a> in that decision, they talked about the abutters that showed up. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4849.532s">In</a> this 14-page decision, there's nothing about an abutter that showed up, nothing about the concerns that they had. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4855.714s">All</a> they talked about was the fact that this is going to be great for that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4860.296s">April</a> 27th of this year, Mayor Burke of this community said this is a great project to develop a new neighborhood in this part of town. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4866.939s">We're</a> excited about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4868.725s">But</a> where is the transparency, the open public meeting on zoning of this nature? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4873.447s">Because</a> you folks have never had a development this large smack you in the face. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4877.828s">And</a> since you've all been here, you've never had an audience like this who are so upset over the fact that they weren't a part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4883.51s">They're</a> coming in after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4885.01s">They</a> should have been here before the fact, before this honorable body. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4888.391s">You</a> folks wrote the law, and you should be well aware of what's going on upstairs in that Board of Appeals. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4901.968s">You</a> know, in the decision, it's relegated to the terms. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4908.155s">They</a> state the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4910.358s">We</a> respect the fact that this zoning and site plan review fits the standards of this particular project. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4922.39s">This</a> is the wording of the zoning and the site plan review. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4925.112s">The</a> purpose of our zoning is to promote the health, safety, morals, convenience, and to lessen the danger from congestion and confusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4933.198s">Site</a> plan review states the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4935.28s">The</a> purpose of this article is to promote development, which is harmonious with surrounding areas and adequate consideration of abutting land owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4944.247s">Well,</a> we have abutting land owners here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4947.149s">Where</a> were their concerns is written in this document. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4949.791s">It's</a> nowhere to be found. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4951.418s">And</a> if it's nowhere to be found here, it's quite obvious that they didn't take it into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4955.68s">And</a> Councilman Marks, again, alluded to the fact that we relied on department head reports, and we relied on their reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4963.064s">Kind</a> of interesting, the folks that, Vanessa Hagan, who was the consultant they had for the traffic study, is the same one that they had for Canal Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4971.748s">And</a> that was only four stories high and for 30 units. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4975.612s">This</a> is 490 units high, 490 units and five stories high. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4981.838s">Big</a> difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4982.939s">But</a> let's get to the bottom line. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4983.941s">What</a> are you going to have here for the bottom line? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4985.402s">Because</a> it's the impact that's going to affect the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4988.185s">This</a> is what you're going to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4989.146s">You're</a> going to have coal. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4990.027s">If</a> everybody's online and all the developments are coming on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4993.617s">You'll</a> have Coles, you'll have Marshalls, you'll have Wegmans, you'll have Lumineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=4997.338s">They</a> just sold their building after one year for $66.6 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5003.841s">What</a> makes you think these people may not do the same thing? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5006.101s">Come</a> in. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5006.442s">Hi,</a> Hawaii. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5007.042s">See</a> you later. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5007.782s">Make</a> a fast buck. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5008.702s">Who</a> pays for it? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5009.463s">The</a> neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5010.542s">Then</a> you're going to have the skating rink over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5012.284s">Then</a> you're going to have the 490 units. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5013.946s">Then</a> you're going to have eight commercial businesses, three apartment buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5017.33s">And</a> now let's take a ride down Locust Street and bang a left and go to Wellington Circle. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5022.096s">You're</a> going to have 200 more units of apartment housing going over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5025.82s">And</a> don't forget the casino when that opens up. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5027.882s">You</a> put this all together. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5029.544s">And</a> you take Little Locust Street, which is a two-way street, it's going to make no sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5034.227s">If</a> this administration had any brains, they would have called you into that office over there, sat down with you and said, what do you think, guys? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5040.452s">This</a> is what I think I'd like to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5042.173s">Can</a> we add or subtract to it and come up with a unified front? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5045.555s">No,</a> you have an administration that just goes on their own way and now you're here to pick up the slack. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5050.861s">And</a> what's the slack? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5051.882s">You're</a> going to have to take money and appeal it on behalf of the taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5055.606s">And</a> I would expect you folks, do appeal it and do spend that money and send the message back to that office over there that you guys and gals are not patsies for someone else's administration when you're not even brought in and consulted. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5067.718s">There</a> is no transparency to what's going on in this city right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5070.94s">And</a> this is the perfect example when you look at a development such as this. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5074.681s">This</a> should never be happened without your consideration and consultation. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5089.709s">You</a> know, we get elected for one reason, or I got elected for one reason when I was on that side of the rail, to do the people's business. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5096.783s">not</a> to sit here and wonder what I'm supposed to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5099.506s">If</a> you're brand new, it's a learning process, then you better learn real quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5102.669s">Because</a> you know what you're dealing with? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5103.69s">You're</a> dealing with the taxpayers' money. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5105.231s">You're</a> dealing with their direction in how this city is supposed to go forward, whether it's on the school department side when you take that final vote, or whether it's on the city side when you're putting all your money together to find out in what direction are we going to be able to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5117.223s">Now,</a> you have a budget coming up right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5119.98s">And</a> in this particular budget, as the councilor, Mr. Rumley alluded to, you should make the request tonight to put a minimum of $50,000 in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5127.604s">And</a> I'm going to tell you the reason why. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5129.865s">A</a> few years ago, when I was on this city council, we had a decision to be made regarding Tufts University on a piece of land that they wanted to take and they wanted to use it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5140.19s">I</a> think it was Foley, Holg, Elliott and Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5143.492s">I</a> think it was a hundred thousand dollars would cost the city, but the city won its case. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5147.994s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5148.63s">because</a> the council was determined when they took that vote that we weren't going to get pushed around and we weren't going to have the Dover Amendment used against us because it was inappropriate at that particular time. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5157.916s">I</a> think it was 1991 or whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5161.202s">But</a> you've got to be realistic about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5162.822s">You've</a> got to move ASAP. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5164.243s">Plus</a> another thing, Mr. Rumley, you can correct me if I'm wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5166.903s">If</a> you guys and girls are going to come on board and appeal this case, you can ask for an extension of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5171.464s">Same</a> thing that the visiting nurses did. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5173.224s">I</a> believe they got a six-month extension of time when the taxpayers decided or the abutters decided to appeal this particular case. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5185.406s">In</a> 1985, I made an offer of a resolution before this Method City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5189.427s">None</a> of you were on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5190.872s">That's</a> why I'm still here, because I remember these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5193.378s">I</a> got a bag full of tricks. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5194.8s">that</a> tells me what to remember every single time, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5198.461s">I</a> made a resolution to put a moratorium on building and construction in the city of Medford because at that point in time, you had high-rise condominiums going up with no rhyme and no reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5208.125s">And</a> if you didn't take a look and see where you wanted your city to go and the traffic impact it would have, the social impact, the educational impact.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5217.348s">And</a> the educational impact, you would have no idea where you're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5220.609s">And</a> then again in 2005, I filed the same resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5224.368s">Miffitt</a> City Council in both times approved it, and both times the city administration did not want to embark upon it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5230.51s">You</a> know, it sounds nice to say, if this development takes place, I think we're going to get, here it goes, we're going to get approximately $1.5 million in building permits. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5241.175s">We're</a> going to get approximately $2 million in linkage. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5243.615s">We're</a> going to get approximately $1.375,000 in tax money. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5250.606s">You</a> know, money just for the sake of money should not make this city drive itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5255.243s">You</a> know what should drive this community? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5257.103s">The</a> heart of every single person in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5259.344s">How</a> you can get along, how you can live together, how your streets can be compatible, how your schools, your churches, and your neighbors can be compatible. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5266.846s">Not</a> to have a group of people come in here tonight, frustrated over the fact this is after the fact, and now you're picking up the ball and going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5275.488s">This</a> should not be. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=5276.868s">They</a> should be coming here tonight congratulating you because you stopped it early on and it came before you at an appropriate time.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3734.503s">My</a> name is Robert Penter. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3735.504s">I</a> live at zero summit road, Medford mass, a former member of this August body. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3739.908s">Uh,</a> to get to council night's question brought up at the council, at the, uh, appeals meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3743.911s">And</a> that's an industrially zoned piece of property. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3746.193s">Number</a> one, and it's 490 units that are being asked over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3750.436s">There</a> are 11 variances that were being presented, 11 variances more than any other time. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3755.3s">And</a> I believe all 11 of them were asking for relief. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3758.37s">And</a> according to the preliminary decision, they've been granted. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3761.553s">That's</a> an awful lot of variances on a one single piece of property. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3766.238s">I</a> think folks really need to understand something, that that night on that, it was an extremely hard night. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3771.903s">And</a> the residents that were there, they waited all night long to make sure that their comments were made, while the developer took as much time as needed, and rightfully so, to present their position. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3781.772s">But</a> there were some comments that some folks still wanted to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3784.433s">Unfortunately,</a> at the very end, they weren't allowed to because I don't know if it was because of the time or for whatever the reasons might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3791.296s">But</a> there are two sites and sections of our own municipal laws that need to be reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3796.398s">And</a> that's Chapter 94, Section 1, which is our zoning ordinance, which says that the change cannot cause congestion or confusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3804.101s">And</a> also under our site plan review under Section 94, Section 33.1, <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3811.439s">excuse</a> me, section 331, it states that the community, the neighborhood has to be taken into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3817.166s">Is</a> it compatible with the neighborhood as it relates to this? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3820.81s">Now,</a> just think of the traffic on the traffic issue alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3824.989s">You're</a> going to start off with the new Lumineers, which is 160 units. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3829.23s">Then</a> you have the ice skating rink. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3831.131s">Then</a> you have across the street, you have Coles and Marshalls. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3833.352s">Then</a> you're going to have the new Wegmans. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3835.092s">Then</a> you're going to have 490 units if that goes through, 7,000 square feet of office space. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3840.174s">Then</a> you're going to have, going down the street a little bit further, two office buildings, and I think there's six remaining commercial pieces of property. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3847.996s">Take</a> that and then go to Wellington Circle, where 200 more units of affordable housing <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3854.335s">are</a> going to be taking place and coming on. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3857.417s">Now</a> just imagine in the middle of the day, 8, 9, 10, weekends, night times, whatever it might be, taking into consideration once the new casino comes in. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3867.602s">You</a> have Riverside Avenue, you have Locust Street, Mystic Valley Parkway, Harvard Street, and all the side streets that spin off of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3875.766s">Do</a> you realize how much traffic that that's going to cause? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3879.308s">And</a> for them to say it has no traffic input makes absolutely no sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3883.785s">I</a> would respectfully ask whoever made that request for next Tuesday night to ask how they made that determination of no traffic input. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3892.387s">Because</a> the developer himself acknowledged that on an annual basis, at a minimum of 1%, traffic will increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3898.808s">And</a> they acknowledged by their own development that traffic will increase in that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3903.689s">But</a> to get back to what you were talking about, smart growth, Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3907.21s">Some</a> years ago, I made an offering regarding growth and development here in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3911.612s">for</a> which we didn't have any review with the prior administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3914.914s">We</a> asked for a moratorium for which at that point in time the council was in favor of, but the city's administration never went forward with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3921.878s">We</a> have no development that takes place in any part of this city that can tell you it's going to work, whether it be smart or not, whether it be compatible or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3932.784s">This</a> development that's taking place down there off of Riverside Avenue in the Wellington area has an environmental impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3940.022s">It</a> has a community impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3942.163s">It</a> has a neighborhood impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3944.424s">And</a> when you look at the development that's taking place by this developer wanting 490 units and a full packed room of residents that were there, and you go back a month prior to, and you look at the 40 units to a four-story building in West Medford that didn't have anywhere near the amount of complete neighborhood support for not wanting the project, how can you say one gets supported and one doesn't? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3970.421s">That</a> doesn't fit well. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3971.502s">It</a> doesn't bode well. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3972.342s">And</a> I'm glad that the majority of almost every one of you councilors are on board for not only having the meeting, but to having open public dialogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3978.666s">And</a> Councilor Lungo-Koehn is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3980.527s">Some</a> years ago when they were doing the 9th Street project, because it was such a large particular project, at that point in time the council asked, and the developer agreed, they came before the council, committee of the whole, and then before the council, and we had a complete community meeting on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3995.075s">Talked</a> about what units were going to be affordable, which ones weren't going to be affordable. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3999.721s">I</a> think it really needs to be understood, and I think Jeannie Martin, you said it right in the beginning, small-scale residential neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4009.587s">Even</a> if it's one person that's impacted, that's one too many. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4012.569s">And</a> when you get the administration, and this President Mayer and her administration, making the comment on April 27th, as reported in the paper, <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4019.912s">that</a> this is a great place to develop a new neighborhood and we're excited about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4024.376s">How</a> can you be excited about it when the neighborhood itself wasn't even aware of it, didn't even have an opportunity to come and speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4030.24s">Well,</a> maybe the Board of Appeals offered their opportunity for the public hearing and never got here. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4035.42s">You're</a> right when you're saying that your zoning should be reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4038.241s">It</a> should be reviewed only because of the fact you don't want to keep going through things of this nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4042.643s">This</a> is a huge development. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4044.765s">This</a> isn't singular. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4045.805s">This</a> is coupled upon that for which is already there. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4049.247s">And</a> that for which is already there will totally decimate that particular neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4054.009s">This</a> isn't even a three or a four-way road. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4055.89s">This</a> is a two-way road going in. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4058.231s">And</a> just imagine all the stores that I just mentioned, Coles, Marshall, Wegmans. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4063.149s">Luminaires,</a> the ice skating rink, 490 units, 7,000 square feet of office space, two apartment buildings, and seven other, you know, public, other commercial pieces of property at any one point in time, at any one day. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4074.136s">What</a> do you think's gonna happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4075.977s">Councilman</a> Marks is right when he talks about what the three new stores that opened up on Riverside Avenue, on any one given night or weekend, or especially on holidays or shopping. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4084.803s">You</a> need not only smart development, you need a stop and look to see where this city is going. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4091.427s">Just</a> development for the sake of development doesn't mean anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4095.189s">If</a> you want to have something that reaches the niche of every single person, whether it be senior citizen housing, whether it be more medical space, whether it be more space for your education, or whatever it might be, I don't know if it's going to take $250,000, but I know this, you would want a complete community interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4114.818s">You</a> know, we don't have to be like some of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4117.45s">But</a> we can beg, borrow, and steal like Somerville does in a smaller way in smaller sections of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4123.173s">And</a> let us not forget one important thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4125.634s">At</a> that meeting last Tuesday night, the neighborhood was most conciliatory by saying it wasn't that they were against the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4133.698s">It</a> was way too large, didn't fit the neighborhood, and they were willing for something that would be much more reduced, that would be more compatible, and at least people could live with. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4142.664s">That's</a> all that they're looking for, something that they can live with, not something that's going to be thrown down their throat because they didn't have an opportunity for input, but more importantly, just because the city's going to garner approximately $2 million in taxes and approximately $1.6 million in linkage fees, this administration's looking at the money and they're cutting the beans as fast as they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4163.281s">And</a> who's going to pay for it? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4164.783s">The</a> neighborhood's going to pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4166.785s">The</a> people who have been there, who have taken care of their property for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4170.33s">All</a> the side streets off of Riverside Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4172.632s">Try</a> to get off of Harvard Street now in the morning, add this to the congestion, and wait until Wellington Circle takes place and the 200 units over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4180.001s">Is</a> everybody going to have a car? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4181.202s">Absolutely</a> not. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4182.183s">But</a> even if it's 10% more on that road, it's 10% more that it can't handle. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4186.826s">We</a> have a police department that's in desperate need of help. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4189.548s">We</a> have a school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4190.669s">We</a> don't know if it's getting maxed out because of these units. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4193.231s">You</a> have a fire department that's stretched. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4194.792s">We</a> don't even know because the administration won't let them do a trial run into Wellington Circle to make sure we have a satellite fire station or a police station there for which the prior administration looked into but never did anything about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4207.642s">You</a> have so many issues that are confronting you here, and to have the Board of Appeals just vote preliminarily to go forward and grant the easement, it's only going to satisfy those money-hungry developers coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4219.948s">Look</a> at Lumineers. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4221.169s">They're</a> not even in there a year, and they sold out for $66.6 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4225.731s">Think</a> about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4226.712s">Who's</a> to say this company won't do the same thing? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4229.413s">But</a> there's one thing that you can't sell out, and that's the integrity and the brains of the people that live in the neighborhood, because they know what's right <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4237.755s">They</a> know what's good for them, and they're paying their taxes, and I'm quite sure they don't want their taxes paid for something like this, which is going to absolutely make their neighborhood a deplorable place to live. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4249.319s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10748.341s">My</a> motion.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10749.482s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10750.397s">I</a> can appreciate the idea that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10752.458s">Hunt</a> and the Energy Office has brought before the council, but I don't think her tenure here has been long enough to understand what the citizens of our community have expected. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10761.563s">We</a> can digress and go back a few years and talk about Stations Landing. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10765.024s">When</a> Stations Landing was coming here into the city of Medford, people, or we were told, that that would be the new panacea of no new growth in this community or a stability in growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10775.71s">And</a> we've all seen what's happened since that point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10778.333s">The</a> taxes have gone up each and every year while we've collected well in excess of a million and a half new dollars each and every year from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10785.395s">Now,</a> the next argument could possibly be the banks here in the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10789.757s">The</a> City of Medford goes out on a daily basis to get the best possible rate on interest rates for the money that they deposit. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10797.88s">Is</a> the City of Medford going to go out of its way now to tell the taxpayers of this community to go to a particular bank that they go to? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10805.222s">And</a> the more people that go to that bank, they're going to get a better interest rate? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10808.863s">because</a> we're getting a good interest rate, which is better than the bank that you're going to. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10813.644s">Same</a> thing with the insurance company. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10815.525s">We</a> have to buy our insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10816.685s">We</a> go out and we get the best bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10818.345s">The</a> best bid will probably be less than the bid that you, Mr. and Mrs. Medford, possibly might be getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10823.647s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10824.747s">But</a> Mr. Champ, you just brought up a very interesting point when you talked about water and sewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10829.448s">You</a> folks have in your budget right now in excess of a $400,000 deficit or a debt on the water <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10836.389s">and</a> the suicide from the city and the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10839.331s">Why</a> isn't the city paying for that? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10841.272s">But</a> right now, they're so concerned about your electric bill, but they're not concerned about the $400,000 that every single taxpayer in this city is paying for because the school department in the city side won't account for their own water. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10854.682s">And</a> hopefully, you people will pass that when the budget comes. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10858.284s">You</a> know, you talk about the state legislature passing these laws, and I think you're right, Councilman Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10862.307s">I</a> think they got this upside down. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10864.682s">opting</a> in rather than opting out. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10867.082s">The</a> best way a community or a city can operate, when they talk to their taxpayers, when they have better communication, but when they don't have good communication, and the only public forum that they have is this council, and the rail here at this council that they can come up and talk, then that's what the conversation should be about. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10885.769s">You</a> shouldn't be talking about taking a vote which mandates somebody that they have to join, and then they might have to figure out when, within 180 days, have to opt out. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10895.953s">That's</a> not the right way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10897.634s">And</a> if we're going to expend municipal time through its employees on projects on behalf of every single taxpayer in this community, then why are you mandating it rather than making it voluntarily so you could show them this is a better way for you, Mr. and Mrs. Medford, to save money rather than be at the option of April or October to a $100,000 consultant <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10922.712s">who</a> was going to be making money trying to tell the city of Medford who might, on a particular day, get the best possible rate, and who might not get that best possible rate during that period of time, but the consultant still makes his money. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10935.556s">I</a> don't think this is a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10937.297s">I</a> think there are more important things to do here in the city of Medford, and I would hope that this Medford City Council does not entertain this particular matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10944.82s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_zvHrHUNZKmI/2025-03-21_zvHrHUNZKmI.html">Medford, MA City Council - May 24, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2758.648s">My</a> name is Robert Pente. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2759.568s">I</a> live at Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2761.809s">I'm</a> a member of the Zagos Party. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2763.729s">You</a> know, this isn't the first time we're talking about police safety and security here within this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2768.151s">I</a> can remember Councilor De La Ruza when you first came on. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2770.392s">I</a> think one of the priorities in this council was the police department in a public safety building. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2775.393s">And</a> we're here so many years later after the fact under a new administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2779.474s">If</a> you really want to have public safety be a real major concern, a major issue here within this council, <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2785.05s">You</a> have a budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2785.75s">I</a> think it was you, Councilor Falco, who said early on that you would like the budget process to be informed a little bit early. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2791.473s">It's</a> something that we've all asked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2792.854s">Councilor</a> Marks, you just alluded to having a wish list for which we don't have, we haven't seen. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2797.897s">You</a> are now coming into almost the end of May, and you have yet to have a budget presented before you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2802.899s">Surrounding</a> cities and towns are already discussing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2806.161s">If</a> this council is really serious about public safety, they would hold the budget up, demand from the mayor, not only a time schedule, <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2814.275s">but</a> the financial wherewithal to put a new police department together and to hire more police officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2819.476s">And</a> I think once that takes place, this administration knows that this Medford City Council is serious. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2824.738s">And</a> you're not just talking about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2826.338s">You're</a> not just referring to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2827.959s">You</a> mean business this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2830.179s">We</a> just had a very tragedy this past week with Officer Tarantino. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2833.84s">His</a> father was a Medford police officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2836.321s">This</a> isn't a matter of whether black lives matter, white lives matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2841.203s">It's</a> every life matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2842.999s">And</a> that's what people have to understand when they look at a police officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2845.661s">They're</a> there each and every single day, just like a fireman, in the public safety realm of this community, to take care of the people that they were, how can you say, that they were charged to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2858.19s">And</a> they don't do it asking for any recompense or any notoriety. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2862.073s">It's</a> their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2864.094s">Well,</a> let's give them a break this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2866.516s">Councilman</a> Marks, you alluded to $8 million sitting in free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2870.759s">City</a> of Marlin, a perfect example. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2873.104s">They</a> got $8 million, and they also got $8 million in grants toward a new police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2878.128s">We</a> haven't even delved into this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2881.19s">You</a> folks haven't even been called into a roundtable meeting with this administration to talk about this, not only as a priority, but as a necessary demand to keep our city safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2892.499s">If</a> we don't have folks like Ian Fratz or Jeanne Martin coming up, and sometimes they may say, hey, they're a pain in the neck. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2897.992s">And</a> you might even think that I'm a pain in the neck, but you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2900.653s">I</a> don't mind being the pain in the neck, because this is my community, and I love it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2904.195s">I</a> served on this board for 36 years, and I have yet to see the Medford Police Department get what they really need, not only in more men and a new building, but a sense of priority here in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2915.961s">And</a> when I compare that and I look and see the nonsense that's going on in the school department, praising the superintendent for whatever he's doing, which can't even compare to what the Smithford Police Department and the Smithford Fire Department does on a daily basis protecting this community and every single one of us in this room, that to me should be the priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2934.646s">And</a> if you really want to be strong about it, you would hold this mayor, Mayor Stephanie Burke, hold her feet to the ground and do not move on that budget until you get your answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2943.809s">for</a> more policemen and a new police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2946.411s">Be</a> happy to answer any questions if anybody has them. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=2950.234s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4151.495s">My</a> name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4154.658s">I'm</a> a member of the Sarkis party. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4156.76s">And</a> I'd just like to say, and I brought this up about two or three weeks ago, <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4160.802s">regarding</a> the bubble. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4162.644s">There's</a> a bond council that wrote the bond proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4167.048s">If</a> you think of this thing logically and you think it through, you're allowing a private for-profit business to come in and take advantage of a city's bond at the city's interest rate and for them to make a profit on city time, on city property. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4181.922s">Well,</a> if we're going to do that, are we opening up Pandora's box to the swimming pool? <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4187.798s">Are</a> we opening up to the skating rink? <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4189.199s">Are</a> we opening up to the new $14.5 million science labs that we have in the school? <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4193.3s">Anything</a> that we've had a bond that can have an effect upon the people within this community, we are now saying, come on in, pay us for what you think you want to pay us, and we'll entertain it if not accept it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4206.285s">You</a> know, Councilman Marks made an interesting comment a few weeks ago when we had this discussion as it relates to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4211.467s">If</a> they're putting so much time into the bubble, I wish they would put more time into the educational process. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4215.632s">at</a> the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4216.932s">They</a> put a lot of time into hiring 5,000 administrators at over $95,000 a piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4221.053s">And</a> as a matter of fact, one of them was one who was terminated from one school, but hired back up at the high school at $95,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4229.035s">A</a> lot of interest, a lot of input went into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4232.735s">But</a> when we look at this, you have a definitely, you have a legal question here. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4236.456s">And</a> I think this council voted, all seven of you voted to have a report back from the bond council. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4243.017s">From</a> the bond counsel who wrote this for the city of Medford, the legal question is, can the city of Medford rent or lease this piece of property to a private for-profit company and then charge back the city of Medford for its use of the same property that they have leased for a measly $75,000 a year? <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4264.163s">Because</a> that's all they give in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4266.144s">And</a> don't forget, if you're right, Councilor Marks, if it's a 10-year deal and the city gets the bond, <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4271.288s">It's</a> not costing these people anything, because they will write this off on a tax write-off for 10 years for its use, especially if it's a for-profit business. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4280.451s">And</a> what are we going to get at the very end as a community? <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4283.012s">Whatever</a> the repairs that are needed to take place are going to take place, and who's going to have to pay for the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4289.134s">These</a> are the type of questions that would be great ballot questions to put out there during a general election. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4295.396s">Because</a> if it's such a wonderful argument and a wonderful issue, the pros and cons of public hearings <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4301.487s">and</a> meetings at city council and at school committee meetings would serve the purpose of whether the people want this or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4308.192s">I</a> think if I had a student up at the high school right now, I would be more concerned on the educational quality of where that student needs to go or would like to go rather than arguing over a bubble that might have some not only logistical, legal questions, but would have questions over the fact that what are we doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4325.003s">Taxpayers'</a> money. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4327.024s">When</a> we as members of the Medford City Council voted for the science labs, <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4331.307s">for</a> the skating rink, for the swimming pool, and Edgeley Field. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4334.63s">We</a> were taking the taxpayers of Medford's money and the bond rating that we were getting at that particular time to purchase that piece of bond in behalf of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4345.058s">You're</a> not doing that now because what you're doing is you're abdicating the responsibility of the bond responsibility by the city and you're allowing an outside for-profit business to come in here, take advantage of it, <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4356.923s">and</a> pay the city a measly $75 an hour, $75,000 a year, while at the same time make thousands and hundreds and thousands of dollars over the life of the bubble. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4367.787s">That's</a> not good financing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4369.387s">That</a> doesn't make good sense to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4371.428s">And</a> I think this needs a lot more attention to the fact that you need all the legal questions asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4376.15s">And</a> I think you really need to compare this with this upcoming budget in the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4381.007s">It</a> makes a huge difference as it relates to where priorities are going. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4385.669s">We</a> just got through talking about public safety, policemen. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4388.109s">We</a> talked about a new police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4389.83s">Well,</a> you're talking now about a bubble. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4392.351s">And</a> before the bubble bursts on the city of Medford and you get stuck with a financial boondoggle, I think we need to say, let's slow down and let's really take a look and see what's going on, because that's what this is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4404.815s">It's</a> your money. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4405.715s">It's</a> our money. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4406.675s">It's</a> the city's money. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4407.936s">It's</a> everybody's money. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4409.373s">And</a> if we're going to allow a private for-profit business to come in and take advantage of our community and our real estate to the detriment of our city, for a measly $75,000, then you're really selling yourself short, and you're selling the taxpayers short. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4427.336s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_nXRer8wKd5o/2025-03-21_nXRer8wKd5o.html">Medford, MA City Council - Apr. 19, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

President and council members. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4636.148s">My</a> name is Robert Penta, Xero, Summit Road, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4638.589s">I'm</a> a member of this board. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4640.35s">I</a> thank Mr. Capucci for coming forward because his flavor on the subject matter is different than mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4645.441s">Mine</a> basically as history has a way of repeating itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4648.744s">Regarding</a> public access here in the city of Medford, we are at the repeating stage once again. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4653.928s">Since</a> early 2013 to date, we, the Comcast and Verizon cable subscribers, have been charged the monthly public access fee totaling some $500,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4663.776s">And</a> we, the subscribers, still have no public access station. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4669.161s">What</a> we heard from 2013 by the city administration was that the city will be asking for <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4674.581s">Channel</a> 3 records, bank statements, meeting minutes, and an inventory accounting of the Channel 3 Public Access Corporation, because then at that point in time, Channel 3 Corporation was filing for dissolution of its Chapter 3 Corporation. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4689.005s">Records</a> of expenditures of gasoline, restaurants, retail, supermarkets, hardware home suppliers, plumbing and air conditioning materials, building materials, auto supplies, <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4701.128s">Miscellaneous</a> expenses in bank and ATM withdrawals, along with deposits and credits from the banks in the accounting were examples that were supposed to have been forwarded to the city of Medford pursuant to the dissolution filing. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4714.412s">As</a> of this date, no accounting of any records, bank statements, meeting minutes, or accurate inventory accounting has ever been verified from channel three. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4724.355s">Regarding</a> the city's lack of providing public access TV, <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4728.358s">The</a> ever-going question since 2013 has been, why has the city failed to mandate that public access be made available as contractually applied for? <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4738.805s">Fast</a> forward to today, and putting aside all the comments and issue regarding the forced ascertainment hearing, the former mayor's commission report regarding public cable access, and multiple council resolutions regarding this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4755.193s">It</a> seems that this administration feels that to spend some $500,000 for an access studio up in the back of Medford High School will serve in the best interest of a local public access station. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4767.221s">I</a> don't believe this to be in the best interest of our subscribers and citizens, and for the following reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4773.525s">It's</a> location, location, location that is the primary success staple of any business. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4780.35s">The</a> Medford High location will not serve the best interest for our public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4785.341s">Examples</a> as to why. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4787.181s">Its</a> public access is not on a main street that is centrally located. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4792.963s">The</a> entranceway is not well lit. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4795.023s">It</a> is not easily accessible to walk up and to walk back the hill from the back to and from Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4803.025s">It</a> presents a winter problem of ice and snow needing to be cleared at all times on the hill and the walkway to the school's back entrance. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4810.947s">It</a> presents a safety security problem for after school hours <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4814.88s">and</a> nighttime lighting is at a minimum. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4818.002s">As</a> a major positive contrast to the Medford High location, the Medford Public Library serves as the best location for public access studio. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4827.326s">It</a> is centrally located within our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4829.887s">It</a> has walking convenience within the city's downtown area and bus routes. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4834.53s">It</a> is handicap accessible to being easily available for front door entrance for bus and cab transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4842.088s">It</a> offers a great additional public educational opportunity for community public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4848.252s">Medford's</a> $500,000 bank deposits from Comcast and Verizon thus far will definitely produce at the library the space needs necessary for this development. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4859.84s">As</a> Councilor Caraviello has indicated by requesting the Massachusetts State Library Commission come to Medford to ascertain what state additional funding can be for the library to Ghana for the library's rehabilitation, <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4871.903s">That,</a> along with what I proposed last year during the Mayor's campaign to have a complaint present use and future use, along with the $500,000 funds that are readily available right now here in City Hall, could catapult the Medford Public Library to being Medford's premier central educational and social meeting spot that incorporates an entire community of opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4894.069s">This</a> would be the perfect segue for having <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4896.987s">The</a> Massachusetts State Library Commission realized that we are working to make our library a major focal point in our city, and their additional support position would certainly carry us to that potential. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4909.972s">It</a> would be an example of how a city fully realizes the community potential of its public library. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4916.575s">To</a> my understanding and education thus far, this would be a first for the Massachusetts State Library Commission to co-invest with a city with matching funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4926.403s">The</a> Medford Vocational School location, as is presently being entertained, could be a satellite location for students' learning of production and access operations as a school program offering separate and distinct from the public access studio. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4941.947s">This</a> opportunity for community public access to be better located and more readily available should not be squandered away because of political posturing. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4951.529s">Mayor</a> McGlynn's own committee report of June 2015 specifically stated, <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4957.305s">We</a> are a committee that feels that the best location will be in one that is conveniently and centrally located with its own entrance and exit and should be handicap accessible. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4967.751s">The</a> Method Public Library could serve no better location than the one that has been advised for. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4974.595s">Also,</a> with the city owning the property, annual rental payments will not have to be provided. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4980.239s">Therefore,</a> providing for more revenue to maintain, upgrade equipment, <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4984.355s">and</a> conveniently offer to the community programs that showcase our city and the families and subscribers that watch and use public access TV. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4993.638s">I</a> respectfully ask that this honorable body of councilors request by a roll call vote that our city administration reconsider its position regarding public access to TV being at Medford High School and entertain the Medford Public Library as the location that will better serve our community in the Comcast and variable cable rate payers <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5013.732s">for</a> paying for their public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5026.477s">Well,</a> I have a question that I presented before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5029.158s">I</a> was just wondering if anyone would entertain that because I think this is a very important issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5033.7s">It's</a> a lot of money and I think it offers a great opportunity.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5825.044s">All</a> set? <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5828.372s">Mr.</a> President, as just a point of reference, for the last six years, prior to last year, don't forget the city of Medford got waivers from the Mass Department, State Department of Library Commissioners, because the city did not put enough money in there when, in fact, they did have the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5840.438s">But</a> putting that aside, with all due respect to Councilor Knight, if you look at the Mass Department of Education, cable, public access, and the teaching of public access is an allowable educational product here in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5855.217s">It</a> can't be a deed restriction, or even, I don't know what the deed restriction can be, because the library is an educational thing, and the public access is educational. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5862.5s">It</a> works hand in hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5863.84s">And</a> as I indicated earlier, what Councilor Caraviello might have met and talked to those folks from the state, they've never had a co-investing partner like the City of Medford would have. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5873.904s">And</a> if we could upgrade not only the building, the roof, the second floor, whatever needs to be done with the $500,000 that the city has at the present time, and moving that forward, having a full public access, <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5884.083s">here,</a> right here in the city of Medford, centrally located, that would help to expedite. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5888.604s">If</a> the administration was serious about the public library, as was a campaign issue during this past year, we wouldn't have to worry about 140 pages being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5897.626s">You'd</a> go out and hire someone ASAP and make that presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5901.027s">And</a> if they knew that the city of Medford was willing to invest its money instead of asking for all of the money from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the board of library commissioners, it's the first of its kind. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5911.178s">And</a> I think they would be more receptive to that than just the plain grant application. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5915.46s">I</a> don't see any what the problem would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5917.241s">Because</a> if we want to move this thing forward, we have the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5920.923s">It</a> isn't like we don't have the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5923.084s">We're</a> not offering the service that's contractually been obligated for through Verizon and Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5929.287s">You</a> do not have public access here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5932.788s">And</a> we can go back to resolutions from 2013 bringing forward <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5936.44s">where</a> the votes have been seven to nothing on this council floor to go forward and find out what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5942.243s">You</a> can't even get the records back from the former Cable 3, the Channel 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5946.926s">We</a> don't even know if they've actually been formally dissolved by the Karma of the Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5950.788s">They</a> could still be in operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5952.93s">Nobody</a> knows nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5953.85s">We</a> haven't received anything back. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5955.851s">But</a> the onus of responsibility, with all due respect, Mr. President, right now can come from this council, because I think you're all on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5962.582s">you</a> want to see something done. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5964.302s">And</a> to find out that they're doing some work now up at that school, and this council not even being notified or entertained about it, that doesn't speak well about transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5974.904s">They</a> can do all the restructuring up there they want and do it for another purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5979.045s">This</a> is more important. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5980.525s">How</a> and where public access is going to go, how the $500,000 is going to go, how it's going to be centrally located, and how it can be immersed into this community <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5988.775s">as</a> an educational product, ready, willing, and able to go locally, not segued in a certain part of this community that has too many obstacles to make the thing work. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5998.999s">Thank</a> you very much.<h2><a

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1206.822s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1207.603s">My</a> name is Robert Penter. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1208.524s">I</a> live at Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1211.358s">Last</a> week we had a conversation regarding these, this position and the issue as it relates to, um, since we're talking about the chief of staff position right now, um, the concern that a chief of staff would have, especially as it relates to the working operation, not only of the mayor's office, but the interaction of all department heads and employees here in the city of Medford and outside concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1231.969s">What</a> bothers me on this particular matter right now is that this position, which became effective on January 4th of this year, <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1238.92s">Um,</a> since it's a title to position and it's a compensated position in a, in a CAF, um, category, um, you're approving it now tonight, but it's been operative, uh, since January 4th of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1250.888s">Uh,</a> last week, um, I brought up the issue and I don't see any, unless you guys and ladies have a paper on your agenda here. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1258.412s">Uh,</a> the relative to the fact that our city auditor has been asked to also, um, entertain doing the duties of the treasurer collector. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1266.548s">And</a> from last week to this week, I've consulted with the division of local services and the department of revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1272.01s">And</a> it's absolutely, you cannot do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1274.571s">The</a> city auditor cannot do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1276.152s">It's</a> a, it's a prerogative and it's a concern of chief.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1281.294s">It's</a> an issue that a chief of staff would look into. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1285.396s">With</a> due respect to the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1288.217s">With</a> due respect, Mr. President, the chief of staff is an advisor, is an advisor to the mayor of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1294.11s">And</a> the advice to the mayor of the community over and beyond legal advice would be whether this is an allowable or whether it's allowable or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1302.274s">There's</a> no case law and there is no state statute that allows whether it be temporary or what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1308.297s">And</a> as a result of that, I think it's something that needs to be addressed because the chief of staff who's been operating since January 4th of this year, it's obvious that that information either has been given to the incumbent mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1320.204s">or</a> the president administration just refuses to, um, abide by it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1324.867s">The</a> law is also quite succinct in its, um, in its review that under chapter 41, section 52, all accounts are rendered to be kept in the departments of any city shall be subject to the inspection of the city auditor or officer having similar duties. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1341.418s">So</a> we know now on the chapter 41, section 52, that that's the auditor's position as it relates to <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1347.002s">not</a> being allowed to do any other position in the department, I mean, in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1351.485s">And</a> chapter 41, section 55 clearly delineates the fact that the town accountant shall be sworn to the faithful performance of his duties, shall hold no other town office involving the receipt or disbursement of monies. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1364.755s">If</a> you've already had a chief of staff since January 5th of this year, that is a known fact that should not be allowed to take place, temporary or otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1373.501s">There</a> is nothing in state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1374.862s">There</a> is no state statute. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1376.379s">and</a> there is no case law that allows this to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1379.12s">The</a> only exemption to the rule is- We have before us- Pardon me? <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1381.901s">We</a> have before us, sir- We're talking about the chief of staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1383.822s">The</a> chief of staff position.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1386.643s">It's</a> one of the duties that a chief of staff does, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1398.368s">I</a> believe the city solicitor was here last week, and in our conversation he did acknowledge the fact that there is no case law, number one, and there is no <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1405.883s">state</a> statute that allows it for temporary or otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1409.305s">He's</a> here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1410.426s">He</a> can stand on his own two feet to say it, but I think the OR is quite succinct. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1414.028s">But</a> more importantly, it's the position of the chief of staff, and they should know this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1417.89s">And</a> this new administration should not be going into a territory knowing that it's in violation of state statute. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1424.414s">Now,</a> the unfortunate part about this whole issue right now is that you have a city solicitor that represents the mayor, that represents the city council, that represents the board of appeals. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1433.139s">And</a> if there's a difference of opinion as to <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1435.414s">who</a> should prevail. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1437.014s">It's</a> quite obvious if the council needs to have a question answered, you still haven't gotten that answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1441.755s">And</a> I think you are entitled to have that answer legally, right, wrong, or indifferent. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1446.617s">I</a> stand here, and I'll be willing to be corrected. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1449.197s">But</a> for my information that I've been able to ascertain, and now speaking with the Division of Local Services at the Department of Revenue, you cannot do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1456.559s">And</a> the law is quite succinct on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1458.326s">That</a> is a prerogative, and that's a detailed description that a chief of staff does. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1462.651s">They</a> are the advisor. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1464.413s">They</a> are the advisor. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1465.454s">And</a> if their advice to the present administration was not consulted with the city's law department, well, that's a mistake there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1472.842s">But</a> if the law department is basically saying this— Point of information, Councilor Knight.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1516.458s">On</a> the motion for approval by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1518.319s">Mr.</a> President, no one is standing here to interrupt the appointment. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1521.802s">The</a> fact of the matter is that that person has been in the position since January 4th of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1526.306s">So</a> all you're doing is finalizing something that was initiated on January 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1530.629s">The</a> person is in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1532.048s">The</a> papers have already gone out. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1533.368s">The</a> individual is signing off as chief of staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1535.549s">So</a> it's already a done deal, so to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1537.95s">And</a> this council deserves to have, within its own bailiwick of information, the fact whether this is right or wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1543.952s">Because</a> if this council is just going to sit there, it would ignore the fact that a city auditor is also assuming the position as a treasurer collector, when you know that there was a young lady, Judy Johnson, who's worked very hard, very capable to be that person, to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1557.516s">Why</a> is that not happening? <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1559.737s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1561.019s">The</a> ball's in your court. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1561.88s">You</a> folks can do what you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1563.401s">But</a> this isn't a good message sending out to the people of this community, that you have a present administration that's potentially working with the conflict of interest and in violation of the law by having one person, the city auditor, assume two positions, that and that of the treasurer-collector, when you have a qualified person downstairs in that office that could do the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1581.354s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1582.135s">Well,</a> I'd like to ask you, Mr. President, is the city council going to request <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1585.73s">a</a> legal opinion on that because I think it's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1588.191s">As</a> a citizen, I'd like to ask one of my colleagues to make that request to the city administration, whether Mrs. Baker on the chapter 41, chapter 41, section 55 is entitled to be the city and the town treasurer at the same time.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1612.054s">Mr.</a> President, with all due respect to my colleague, he knows.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1657.528s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1663.61s">You</a> can take a roll call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1664.67s">I</a> mean, you can take a vote on it or what? <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1665.911s">Yeah,</a> we'll take a vote on it.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_c_1hhrksa9M/2025-03-21_c_1hhrksa9M.html">Medford, MA City Council - Jan. 12, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3243.293s">Please</a> state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3245.014s">Good</a> evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3245.415s">My</a> name is Robert Penter. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3246.515s">I</a> live at Zero Summit Road in Massachusetts, and I think we're in an area right now where we have a unique opportunity to really look at what our audiences are saying and where we can be going, because if we're going to relegate ourselves to changing audiences, maybe we should just look at the total picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3262.665s">The</a> total picture revolves itself around to the victor goes to spoils, and I understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3267.743s">But</a> rather than change our municipal ordinance or any ordinance, maybe we ought to take advantage of what the law already allows for. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3275.546s">The</a> new administration does have a unique opportunity to hire any individual he or she would like. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3281.768s">Massachusetts</a> General Laws, Chapter 4, Section 7, Sixth A, allows for coterminous appointments that would exist to that of the mayor in this particular situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3294.763s">And</a> what would happen there, that the individual who would be appointed would not be subject to any municipal ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3301.408s">They</a> would just be subject to this particular law, which happens to be state statute, and every person that's in the mayor's office, which is an administrative appointment, would find itself in a co-terminus position as it relates to the term that the mayor sits in that office. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3316.598s">If,</a> in fact, a new mayor were to come in in the future, the person sitting in that position would then be reviewed <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3322.505s">at</a> a subsequent time by the then new mayor for the purposes of whether they continue to be coterminous or whether in fact they are going to be eliminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3331.587s">They</a> would come under the same privileges of having a review to their job, their job application, and what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3337.768s">The</a> second portion that you would have to look at is these individuals are serving at an at-will position. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3345.165s">The</a> mayor chooses individuals to work in that particular office, his or her office. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3349.65s">And</a> by looking at having that person sit in that particular office, you have to take into consideration the fact that are we putting people in there because of a municipal ordinance? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3360.302s">Are</a> we putting people in there because it's going to be coterminous? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3362.704s">Are</a> we putting those people in there because they're at will? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3365.928s">Now,</a> if you look at all the state rules and laws and regulations as it relates to at-will contracts, you can have these made in such a way that you can fire them and hire them anytime they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3375.555s">They</a> can leave anytime they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3376.856s">You</a> can have an employment contract that basically relegates what their terms and duties are in this particular office. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3382.801s">And</a> to do that, that sets the tempo of making sure that you do have and you have hired the right person. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3388.865s">For</a> example, you might hire somebody and the person just doesn't work out six, seven months down the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3394.249s">Then</a> what are you going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3395.729s">If</a> you stick with the municipal ordinance the way it is, you're not going to have the same luxury of either an at-will or a coterminous type of an individual, because that way the other review factor would be part and parcel of what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3408.134s">Second</a> of all, and more importantly, whether it's this position or any other position, you have to look at the conflict of interest issue that revolves around the people in this particular case. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3417.997s">In</a> this particular case, you already have one individual that's working in the office, I believe it was on or about January, <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3425.547s">in</a> January, early January, and this individual also happens to be on the, on the transition team. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3432.372s">Well,</a> being on a transition team and also getting paid by the city of Medford for being an individual working in the mayor's office right now, I think presents itself, Mr. Solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3442.22s">And</a> I asked the question, I begged the question, so to speak, is there a conflict of interest? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3446.604s">Because</a> the impartiality of a transition team is supposed to bring the recommendations <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3450.89s">to</a> the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3452.23s">But</a> when you're getting paid by the administration, and you're also on this transition team, you're also, I think, if you look under the conflict of interest law, you're possibly looking or possibly indicating that there could be a conflict, there might be a conflict, or it could appear to be a conflict. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3466.453s">And</a> really, that's what you don't want right now, especially starting off with a brand new administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3471.194s">So</a> I would suggest to my colleagues, as you review this thing in your committee of the whole, that you <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3477.083s">look</a> into this thing a little bit further, over and beyond changing a municipal ordinance or adding or subtracting to it, and look at the term that's allowed by state statute under the term of being either coterminous or at-will employees, because your responsibility back to the taxpayers is not the same as that of the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3494.672s">If</a> you appropriate money for those particular positions, the question then becomes, after that appropriation, you have absolutely no control. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3502.536s">You'll</a> have absolutely no control over that employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3505.093s">other</a> than the chief executive officer making the final decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3508.295s">So</a> if you want to ask the hard questions, this is the time to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3511.717s">But</a> you do have options, and your options are either serve coterminously, number one, at will, number two, and more importantly, I think you really need to look at the conflict of interest that presently exists in the office, because I don't think it's right that someone who's on the transition team at the same time is getting paid well in excess of $90,000 to sit in the mayor's office at the present time and take on another job and duty and responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3533.608s">the</a> same job and duty of responsibility that will come up in the next issue that's going to be presented before you. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3539.43s">I'll</a> be more than happy to answer any questions, but I just think you really need to look at this thing more in its totality as to what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3545.713s">And</a> I really think Councilor Lungo-Koehn is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3548.174s">I</a> think you need a listing of every single person, their job classification, who they're replacing, and more importantly, what's the difference in the salaries, because that's going to make a big difference as to why are we making these changes at all and for what reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3561.113s">And</a> I think you deserve that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3562.114s">And</a> that's what transparency is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3564.215s">And</a> you should not be afraid to ask the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3566.316s">It's</a> the taxpayer's money. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3568.257s">And</a> it's your duty and responsibility, as it was mine when I was sitting on that side, to make sure that the money was accounted for properly and appropriately. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3576.181s">So</a> that's it, if anyone wants to ask any questions.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4441.418s">Watch</a> the button there, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4442.378s">I</a> did. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4442.998s">Bob</a> Penta, 07 Road Method Mask. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4445.219s">I'd</a> just like to bring your attention to the number F section over there, where it says report to the director of finance auditing on matters that pertain to procurement. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4454.441s">On</a> January 5th of this year, the city administration appointed Ann Baker to also be the city treasurer, beside being the city auditor. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4462.602s">She</a> can't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4463.443s">It's</a> illegal. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4464.003s">It's</a> against the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4465.601s">and</a> I don't even know why she's being allowed to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4469.023s">The</a> second section of the law is very specific as it relates to where we're going on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4473.825s">Chapter</a> 41, section 52 states that all accounts are rendered to be kept in the departments of the city shall be subject to the inspection of the city auditor or officer having similar duties. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4486.231s">Now,</a> the term city auditor and town auditor is interchangeable under our state statute. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4491.073s">Then</a> you go to chapter 41, section 55, and it's clear as a bell. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4495.75s">The</a> town accountant shall be sworn to the faithful performance of his duties, shall hold no other town office involving the receipt or disbursement of monies." <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4505.133s">So,</a> I don't know where you're going with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4507.693s">I</a> think Mr. Solicitor, you need to look at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4509.534s">I</a> could be wrong, but the way I read that, your town auditor or your city auditor, which is Ann Baker, is also now, as of January 5th, the city's tax collector. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4519.176s">She</a> can hold both those positions, a direct conflict of law. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4522.448s">Uh,</a> it's conflict of interest, excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4524.269s">And</a> the law is very specific, especially chapter 41, section 55. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4527.931s">I</a> think a committee of the whole is so important to understand all the ramifications, you know, what this is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4535.135s">Um,</a> you, as I said before, you have a lady that's a come on board from the transition team at $106,000 a year, um, as the director of budget and personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4545.901s">And</a> that's what her title is, unless that's going to change in the future, what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4549.866s">These</a> are issues that I think the council needs to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4551.947s">I</a> think you need to know all the names, the dollar amounts, and wherever you're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4555.589s">But</a> the conflicts that possibly and potentially arise, and this is one. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4559.311s">It's</a> as clear as a bell. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4560.472s">She</a> got appointed in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4562.033s">She</a> is our city auditor. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4563.854s">And</a> apparently, she's going to be the city treasurer for another 60 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4567.476s">You</a> can't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4568.777s">The</a> law is specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4569.757s">It's</a> not me saying it. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4571.038s">It's</a> the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4571.558s">You</a> only can serve one master. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4572.739s">You</a> only can serve one position at one time, especially in the city or town. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4577.233s">And</a> with all due respect, I just think before you guys just jump in, ladies, before you jump into this thing, I think you really need to understand the full ramifications. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4585.079s">Not</a> only that, but the background of the individuals that are accepting these positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4589.722s">Again,</a> the mayor, whoever he or she might be, has that privilege of hiring whoever they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4595.586s">But</a> if there's a potential conflict, that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4599.208s">And</a> then if there's also a possibility that, I'm not saying take the job out of a classification, I'm saying take the job out of a time sequence. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4606.929s">and</a> make it run coterminous with the mayor, whether it's a CAF 14, 18, 22, whatever it might be, as it designated to the terminology, chief of staff, secretary. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4616.394s">I've</a> got no problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4617.794s">That's</a> not the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4618.575s">The</a> real issue is the person that's being hired, whether it's at will or whether it's coterminous. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4623.677s">But</a> more importantly, in this particular case, I think it needs to be addressed immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4627.919s">Ann</a> Bega cannot be the city auditor. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4629.84s">She</a> cannot be the city's tax collector at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4632.982s">The</a> law is specific, chapter 41, section 55, <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4636.213s">says</a> it, I don't say it, and I would expect that the city takes the appropriate action on that matter, just to make sure that they don't get themselves in any kind of a quandary as a conflict that possibly could exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4647.637s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4873.568s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4875.208s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4875.808s">Mr.</a> President, I would like to make a response since the city solicitor challenged. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4881.089s">Point</a> of order, Councilor Knight.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4934.881s">I'll</a> address my comments back to the City Council so we don't have to have a discourse back and forth between my friend, the City Solicitor, and myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4942.685s">If</a> he wanted to take that one step further as to what I said, I didn't say it was illegal, I said it has potential for conflict of interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4948.948s">And</a> Councilman Marks is absolutely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4950.849s">If</a> there is at present an Assistant City, what's her name, Treasurer, no, Mrs. Baker, an Assistant, there's two Assistants in both of those offices. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4963.562s">Whether</a> it's Ann Baker as the auditor or Fred Pompeo's office as an assistant, they both have two capable individuals that could assume either one of those roles. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4971.571s">And</a> my argument is, and it's very specific in here, I have a difference of opinion with my city solicitor friend, whether either one of those two assistants assume the position, but making one person assume both of them when you have other people just as capable <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4985.486s">and</a> able to do the job presents and begs the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4988.668s">And</a> that's what the issue is. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4990.189s">How's</a> the checks and balances going to take place? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4992.711s">A</a> city auditor is supposed to be the checks and balances as to how and when the city spends its money. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4998.195s">So</a> if the city auditor wants to challenge, you know, what the treasurer-collector has done in the past, which has been her job, now that person is assuming both those positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5008.302s">She</a> will have a conflict between herself as to what role am I supposed to play, the auditor or the treasurer-collector? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5015.207s">And</a> that makes no sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5016.788s">And</a> especially since you have the personnel that are in this building, well qualified, work their way up to the ranks, they should be given that opportunity rather than even get into this discourse that we're having right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5027.396s">That's</a> what begs the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5028.957s">Why</a> are we even discussing this? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5030.278s">There</a> is no need for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5031.859s">You</a> have people in this building, they're getting paid, they've been trained, and they do their job well. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5037.343s">But</a> to take one person and put it in charge of two, which is the checks and balance person, how do you checks and balance yourself? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5045.234s">That</a> doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5047.415s">The</a> law is very specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5049.475s">You</a> only can serve one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5051.276s">And</a> whether it's temporary or not temporary, we're not at that juncture of the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5055.657s">Where</a> we are right now is the fact that you have personnel that are capable and able of doing the position. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5062.399s">And</a> that's what you should be talking about, and that's what should be being addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5066.301s">Not</a> one person assuming two positions and scratching their head and saying, what would happen if something were to happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5073.203s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7559.108s">Mr.</a> President? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7561.11s">Sir?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7561.29s">I'd</a> like to speak about... Please state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7564.252s">Bob</a> Henton from Zero Summit Road, Medford, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7565.774s">I'd</a> like to speak about the contract in one particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7568.956s">If</a> you go back and look at the contract and look at the proposal that was made, we were talking at one point in time of possibly having zones here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7576.443s">And</a> to date, there are no zones, and none of the METAs are identified as being in any particular zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7582.707s">As</a> Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7583.147s">Rodriguez</a> just got through saying, during this past month of December, people were putting money in the METAs, and the METAs were accepting them. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7591.452s">I</a> think the question needs to go a little bit further to the Park-Metford office to find out what their technology is, because they should be able to shut down that meter that indicates that they will not accept the money on any particular day. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7603.341s">As</a> far as the new meters in downtown Metford Square, I think Councilor Caraviello can attest to this, because I think he was a product of it, putting the money in the meter, and the meter did take the money in Metford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7615.27s">So</a> you have situations here that even where you have the pay park ones, and now you have the stanchions <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7621.321s">where</a> you put the quarters in, there are some problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7624.003s">I</a> think it would behoove the council not only to have your first annual update, Councilor Caraviello, as you were talking about, maybe to have them come in here and find out, especially with two new councillors, what your concerns might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7634.01s">They</a> indicated that they have all this technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7636.872s">They</a> have this computer app technology and whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7640.835s">But</a> there definitely are concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7642.276s">There</a> are people still getting tagged for no reason at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7645.678s">And</a> more importantly, there are no zones. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7647.379s">City</a> of Boston is very clear <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7649.257s">on</a> how they address their issue relative toward their parking and their meters, their zones and their territories. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7655.219s">It</a> would be very easy to put zone locations on each and every one of the meters and each and every one of the, you know, it doesn't take a lot to put, you know, the number, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7664.863s">And</a> you don't have to go through the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7667.123s">And</a> on Christmas Eve day, Christmas Eve day in the afternoon, people were getting tickets right up until six o'clock at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7674.566s">I</a> think that's just a little bit disingenuous, as I said before, <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7678.072s">They're</a> nothing but a bunch of bounty hunters coming here to Boston and Medford, Massachusetts, to get as much money as they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7684.734s">And</a> it's just not working out. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7686.335s">And</a> with the two new councils on here, I would hope that they would be brought up to date that the past council, the very past one in December, voted seven to nothing to give the senior citizens in the city of Medford the break of not being able to pay, because that was one of the concerns that was attributed by the president administration that they would do. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7704.602s">So</a> I think it's an issue that needs to be addressed, and I think it's an issue <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7708.332s">that</a> should work well for the City of Medford, especially for the seniors in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7712.513s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_1nhdBin4gl8/2025-03-21_1nhdBin4gl8.html">Medford, MA City Council - Dec. 15, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=455.591s">Mr.</a> President, and for those who might be watching and are interested in our public safety and our Medford Police Department, most recently there was an incident, a public health incident that took place in the Medford Police Department building. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=467.658s">And</a> unfortunately it was a backup and it was a sewage backup into the building, which has caused a huge contamination of probably the basement area where the cells are downstairs and a whole host of other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=481.005s">This</a> city council has been advocating for the past two years that their first priority would be for a new police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=487.75s">I</a> in my campaign for mayor advocated that a police station would be my top priority on there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=493.473s">What</a> I don't understand and what I don't see is the unfortunate need that what our method police officers go through male and female on a daily basis is not being recognized and has not been recognized for the past 28 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=506.382s">The</a> unfortunate part is simply this. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=509.277s">We</a> need a new method police station, and we need to have our public safety be brought up to par. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=513.78s">We're</a> down by at least a minimum of 10 police officers, and that's rank and file. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=518.083s">That's</a> not management or captains or lieutenants. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=520.124s">That's</a> just rank and file patrolmen. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=521.625s">You</a> know, there's a new administration coming on board, and I would hope that they're not looked at, the police department with John Desai, because maybe they didn't take the positive position in coming out and endorsing that particular person. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=534.614s">But</a> the unfortunate part is, that should not be used against them. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=538.103s">Our</a> public safety right now is at an all-time low. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=541.546s">Our</a> police cruises are at an all-time low. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=544.369s">The</a> building itself, the evidence room, and everything else that surrounds the Medford Police Department on a daily basis is at an all-time low. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=551.636s">It</a> needs to be addressed now. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=552.977s">It</a> cannot wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=554.358s">Public</a> safety in our community cannot be put on hold, and it should not be put on hold. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=558.842s">And</a> I would hope that anyone who might be watching, and anyone who has an interest in public safety, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=563.223s">And</a> anyone who really believes that our Medford Police Department deserves better, because that's what our taxes are paying for, now is the time to come forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=570.508s">You</a> have a new administration coming on. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=572.089s">You</a> have two new Councilors coming on. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=573.87s">The</a> commitment has to be made. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=575.631s">The</a> finances has to be looked out for and sought out. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=578.453s">And</a> they can be. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=579.274s">Malden</a> is a perfect example. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=580.975s">They're</a> building a brand new police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=583.256s">They</a> already have $9 million of the $18 million they've already secured in grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=587.699s">Medford</a> cannot be put on hold any longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=590.362s">in</a> regards to its police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=592.324s">And</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I would hope that this city council and the incoming city council holds new administration's feet to the fire to build that brand-new police station in behalf of not only the citizens of this community, but because of the public safety that is necessary and it's demanding right now on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=611.842s">All</a> you have to do is talk to the police officers, talk to the chief of police, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=616.683s">and</a> ask them what they think should be done as compared to what is being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=621.064s">I</a> thank you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=653.127s">Mr.</a> President, since 2013 until now, December of 2015, it's been approximately 2 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=661.39s">And</a> during that period of time, the city of Medford has intentionally, the city administration has intentionally taken ratepayers' money from Comcast

href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=674.604s">As</a> of today, there is approximately $400,000, $450,000 sitting in the city coffers downstairs for public access television. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=684.607s">Public</a> access television for which the mayor and its current administration has intentionally not allowed here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=692.09s">And</a> who's at the loss of that? <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=693.37s">And</a> that's the cable TV subscribers. <a

election had the opportunity to be on public access, to have their position stated, accepted, rejected, or even looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=707.926s">No</a> citizen of this community has had the opportunity to have their shows relative to sports, family events, or anything that might be educational, historical, to be put on public access television. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=718.832s">During</a> the past two years, what the mayor did is he implemented a three-member committee person, three-member person committee, for the purposes of reviewing public access here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=728.317s">Coming</a> up with a concocted story, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=730.165s">that</a> at some point in time, on or before Memorial Day of 2015, we would have something ongoing. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=736.768s">And</a> we don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=737.349s">This</a> is now December 2015, almost seven months later. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=741.791s">And</a> the money just keeps coming out of your cable bill each and every month from Verizon and Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=748.674s">We</a> had a public access meeting here for contract renewal with Comcast here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=754.577s">It</a> was another 10-year deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=757.139s">And</a> no one, not one person from the city administration, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=760.087s">Not</a> one person showed up to defend and argue on behalf of Comcast customers. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=765.572s">I,</a> along with nine other citizens, were here to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=768.634s">And</a> this isn't because we're for or against. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=771.297s">It's</a> a 10-year contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=772.578s">And</a> in today's day and age, 10-year contracts are basically unheard of, especially when technology is so far advanced and it's ever-changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=780.625s">From</a> California all the way to Massachusetts, there's a combination of maybe even a collage <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=787.092s">between</a> Verizon and Comcast technicians working together, sharing their jobs together as they traverse across the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=795.178s">And</a> yes, there is a movement out there that maybe public access is not the way to go because between Amazon and all these other technological programs that are out there between a combination of streaming or buying on Netflix or whatever it might be, the idea is out there that the city of Medford is not having it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=813.731s">With</a> a proposal now that seems to be languishing, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=816.642s">of</a> possibly putting it up in the vocational school, a place that would serve no purpose, especially in the winter months that we have right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=824.445s">It's</a> dark out. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=825.625s">The</a> bus route would stop the person getting off at the bottom of the hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=828.727s">You</a> would have to walk up to the top of the hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=830.527s">God</a> knows where you would have to go into the building to get in. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=833.728s">It</a> does not serve a purpose because all this type of information on public access needs to be located in a centrally located place. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=842.552s">And</a> when you have something that's centrally located, it would bring more people. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=846.645s">City</a> of Reading, Town of Reading, perfect example. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=849.507s">Not</a> only do they have it in the downtown area, they have it on every Saturday morning at 11 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=854.051s">It's</a> open to the public, coffee and donuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=855.992s">People</a> can come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=857.053s">They</a> show you how to make your own program. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=858.734s">They</a> lease out, rent out their equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=861.076s">They</a> show you how to use the equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=862.397s">They</a> show you how to make your own programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=864.519s">I</a> know we've had this discussion before over and over and over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=867.541s">But</a> the fact of the matter is when we started this discussion, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=870.379s">There</a> was nowhere near $450,000 sitting in the coffers downstairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=875.463s">And</a> when in fact some of that money was used to pay for salaries of three individuals up at the high school in a program out there that has nothing to do and has nothing to do by law with cable access and public TV access here in the city of Medford, and nothing's been challenged in that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=890.553s">What</a> needs to be done in this city is that you need a revolution in thought where people can turn around and say, hey, wait a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=898.193s">These</a> are your dollars that are being taken out of your cable bill each and every month. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=903.077s">It's</a> almost like coming out of your check. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=905.059s">You're</a> paying for something that you're not getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=906.9s">$450,000</a> is nothing to sneeze at, and you still have nothing for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=912.604s">It's</a> unfortunate that we have to talk about this thing over and over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=916.107s">It's</a> like the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=917.508s">There's</a> a problem out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=918.948s">It's</a> being discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=920.309s">It</a> needs to be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=921.569s">It</a> needs to be revolutionized to the point it needs change. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=926.031s">New</a> council coming in, new administration coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=928.712s">I</a> hope the change takes effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=930.933s">But</a> the people, you, the taxpayers out there, you're paying for this each and every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=935.434s">And</a> you need to hold every one of the councils accountable, as well as the mayor, to make sure that your tax dollars, your cable bills, your water bills, anything that revolves around you paying for something in this community, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=947.363s">for</a> a service or a tax or a bill is being accounted for and spent wisely. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=951.806s">I</a> would hope, and I'll leave this as a thought rather than asking or putting the council on the spot, I would hope as a thought that the incoming city council does not allow this to continue to go on, that you come up and step up forward in demand of the new city administration, that you want cable access television here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=974.702s">That's</a> what the people have paid for. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=976.802s">If</a> not, give them the $450,000 back and figure out another way to do business here because it's absolutely wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=982.566s">It's</a> almost stealing people's money and not doing what they're supposed to be doing with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=987.509s">And</a> that is just so wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=989.571s">You</a> don't tell our kids when you're making them grow up, this is the way life is supposed to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=994.674s">You</a> pay for something you're not getting or you take something that you don't deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=998.677s">That's</a> exactly what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1000.859s">The</a> city has taken your money that they don't deserve because they're not doing anything with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1005.041s">And</a> at the same time, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1006.102s">You're</a> paying for something that you're not getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1008.703s">It's</a> a no-win situation for you, the ratepayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1011.905s">So</a> with that being said, I would hope, Mr. President, and Rick, I know next year, I'm assuming if the deal is the way the deal is supposed to be, you as the president of the council, you would be able to tell, you know, this is where we're going to go with this particular direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=1026.932s">And</a> as far as that goes, Mr. President, I leave my comments as they are.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2909.681s">Mr.</a> President, one of the key components of public access television is taking place here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2915.665s">We're</a> allowing people—not allowing, this is the People's Forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2918.765s">They're</a> having the opportunity to come up and speak for whatever their positions might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2923.306s">But</a> in June of 2014, a federal judge by the name of James O. Browning made a very distinct comment as it relates to people who have the opportunity to come up and speak and to give their opinions. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2936.15s">And</a> what that federal judge did to this particular city was to punish, and I won't say use the word punish, was to admonish them for not allowing criticism to be made at a podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2948.637s">Because</a> as he said, criticism at a podium is an unconstitutional burden on free speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2954.339s">So</a> if somebody wants to come here, or a council wants to compliment, commend, or whatever it might be, or somebody wants to go to that podium and speak in such a manner, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2962.342s">But</a> criticism of any commentary is just as much important or is just as much a part of free speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2969.384s">And</a> just as Browning indicated, and he said, limits can be placed on time and topic, but not on a speaker's opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2976.787s">And</a> whatever the speaker feels he'd like to say, within reason, as long as it's not abusive, and it's his opinion, it needs to be allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2985.652s">He</a> wrote an 89-page decision, and I'm waiting for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2988.233s">I</a> asked for the 89-page decision on that, because that's a huge issue right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=2992.636s">Freedom</a> of speech, and allowing freedom of speech, and inclusive of freedom of speech, if there's a criticism included in there, and they're saying it, and it's done in fair commentary, it should not be excluded. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3006.808s">and</a> it should not be cut off. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3007.889s">As</a> a matter of fact, this whole decision by the judge banned a particular city council from imposing critiques on anyone who was speaking there. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3017.876s">So</a> I believe it's monumental. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3019.497s">It</a> goes back to June of 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3022.619s">It's</a> a federal justice. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3023.599s">It's</a> not even a local justice. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3025.04s">It's</a> a federal district court justice making his opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3028.343s">And</a> that's the second time within the year 2014 that two federal judges came out <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3035.161s">and</a> made this commentary as it relates to free speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3037.863s">And</a> those who might want to critique or be critical of somebody speaking or whatever the commentary might be, as he said, quote, it's an unconstitutional burden on free speech by disallowing someone to voice their opinion, be it in a critique manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3051.735s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3171.209s">The</a> case was very succinct and it was not allowing people to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3175.311s">The</a> council <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3176.534s">in</a> its wisdom, decided council president, for whatever the reasons might be, did not allow people to make negative comments, to say anything negative at council meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3185.442s">And</a> that, in and of itself, was an unconstitutional burden on free speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3189.945s">Whether</a> it was a council rule or the actions that were taking place, it found itself all the way to the Supreme Court. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3196.191s">Strike</a> that, the Federal District Court, by Justice Browning. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3199.932s">So</a> I guess a word to the wise is sufficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3202.353s">Whether</a> it's a ruling or not a ruling, or just not allowing anyone, for whatever the reasons might be, not to make a commentary contrary to what was being said, it's not allowable. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3212.235s">It's</a> an exercise against free speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3215.836s">And</a> the ruling is very succinct.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3736.97s">Chair</a> recognizes Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3738.652s">On</a> the raised crosswalks, now we just got through putting one on Winthrop Street a couple of years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3742.607s">And</a> you could drive down that street right now and go over it so that there's nothing to indicate other than a sign or a thing on a pole. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3752.139s">Cars</a> go down that street kind of like fast. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3753.842s">I</a> saw a bus the other day almost do a pretty good, pretty high jump going over that speed bump. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3759.349s">Maybe</a> they should paint that thing yellow. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3761.722s">with</a> that special paint, so to let people know that there is a speed bump that they're approaching. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3765.423s">Because</a> if you're driving down the street on any given day, and if anybody knows anything about Winthrop Street, when the sun is out in the morning, it's very, very hard to differentiate how the road is coming and the traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3775.606s">It's</a> all enough, it's public safety going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3777.867s">So</a> I would make a suggestion that that public, that speed bump, or what do you call it, the raised sidewalk, be painted in yellow, bright iridescent yellow, so people realize that they're coming up to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3787.79s">That's</a> right in front of the church over there.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3800.121s">They</a> have special paint for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3801.262s">Mr.</a> President.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_UdTpFX1NL7M/2025-03-21_UdTpFX1NL7M.html">Medford City Council - October 20, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=935.988s">I'll</a> let the gentleman speak first.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2677.349s">Some</a> years ago, excuse me, so many years ago, Shaviro Auditorium could have possibly been non-existent here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2684.754s">You</a> may remember this. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2685.635s">When</a> they were cutting up the old Medford High School, Shaviro Auditorium was part of the original package. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2691.34s">And</a> it was at the behest of the then Medford City Council <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2694.398s">that</a> the separation took place, because if it didn't take place, we wouldn't even be talking about this today. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2699.461s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2700.402s">This</a> is the second time, I would say, in the last six months, I think it was Councilor Caraviello who brought up the resolution some six months ago or thereabouts, when there was a private film developer here in Medford Square, and they were putting up a marquee on top of the Chevalier Theater, and that drew so much attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2716.052s">People</a> thought that they were getting a marquee and shows were going to be coming to town. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2719.274s">It</a> was a great idea, and unfortunately, it didn't go anywhere because it wasn't <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2724.962s">It</a> wasn't the auditorium's idea to put the marquee up. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2727.784s">It</a> was the private entrepreneur from Hollywood to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2730.807s">But</a> it's a showing that if you had something like that, people would know what's coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2735.69s">Now,</a> as far as the great debate goes, it was well advertised. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2738.412s">The</a> chamber should be very proud of what they did. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2740.894s">I</a> am very proud of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2742.295s">And</a> more importantly, I just think it goes to show that if you bring something into that theater, people will come. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2748.78s">Now,</a> once you got into the theater, I think you saw something different. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2751.381s">I</a> think what you saw was a very old building <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2754.203s">that</a> probably needs some rehabilitation, but you don't want to take the character away from the building that's contained inside of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2761.124s">I</a> believe they did a great job in the lobby and the bathrooms coming in, and that took some money. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2765.365s">Again,</a> all volunteer work. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2766.666s">It's</a> been all volunteer work since the separation took place from Old Mifflin High School and Cheviot became independent. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2772.947s">The</a> unfortunate part about it, I just don't think it's ever been looked upon by city government the same way it's looked at now it is today, because you know it's a viable asset here for this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2784.247s">It</a> can make money for the theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2785.668s">It</a> can also definitely make money here for the folks here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2790.35s">The</a> part about it, I think it was Councilor Marks alluded to the fact that it's not air-conditioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2794.372s">And</a> as you know, when you go to the Boston theaters, they are air-conditioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2797.814s">And</a> in the heat of the summer, you're just not going to get the type of a show that you think you would like to get because you're not Boston, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2804.677s">The</a> drawer is not the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2806.228s">The</a> amenities around the theater probably are not the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2810.311s">But</a> this theater is one of the catalysts that's going to make this square come back and come alive. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2816.755s">This</a> is what the new administration is going to want to deal with, because it's going to be good for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2822.299s">And</a> it's going to show that arts, culture, and history can be incorporated into your everyday commercial life. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2828.604s">It</a> can be incorporated into your business district. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2830.885s">And</a> it definitely can be communicated and worked into <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2833.92s">your</a> everyday nightlife that the City of Medford is working on very slowly. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2838.884s">It</a> was quite obvious that on that particular night, we had folks there from Somerville SCAT TV. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2844.429s">And</a> the only problem that I would probably say that presented itself that night, that should have been the City of Medford's cable access telecasting that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2852.356s">We're</a> going on the 21st year of the third year of a 10-year contract with Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2858.072s">And</a> because we're going on this third year, and because we just renewed, the city, excuse me, the city just renewed its contract, I believe it was May 7th, the public hearing took place, and I was the only one here for the city because I believe that Shavia, as well as other parts of this city, should have been included into the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2873.975s">And</a> if Shavia was wired properly, we wouldn't be talking about this for the next 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2879.876s">So</a> I think what the commission's gonna have to deal with, and it's gonna be a very tough deal, is no matter what they wanna produce there, and what they wanna show, and how they wanna get it out, <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2887.957s">It's</a> going to be costly, and they're going to have to go out of town because, again, Comcast is not there. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2893.6s">Maybe</a> we can do something about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2895.321s">Maybe</a> we can revisit that whole issue of how we're getting it rewired for whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2899.343s">But</a> right now, it doesn't stand that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2901.724s">And</a> when you have folks there from the high school, which was Channel 15, and you had the government channel being there, the people were excited over the fact that not only did you have almost 1,000 people there, but people would be able to watch this live. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2914.771s">They'd</a> be able to see it subsequent to that on a later date. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2918.499s">I</a> can't say nothing more other than the fact that I believe it was a good night for everybody there, the contestants, the panelists, the folks that put the program together. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2927.502s">It</a> did exactly what it was supposed to do, make the people, let them know, A, there's an election, but more importantly, let them know that Chevalier Auditorium is a viable component here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2939.825s">So</a> rather than letting, have all these volunteers do the work, it's time that the city steps up to the plate. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2945.107s">The</a> city of Lynn, <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2946.392s">proposes</a> our office, I could be wrong, John, you can correct me. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2949.093s">I</a> think it's about $100,000 they started off their auditorium commission over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2954.475s">They</a> gave them the money to do a show. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2956.476s">You</a> go do the show, give us the money back, we'll give you the money for the next show. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2960.618s">And</a> slowly but surely, it was one of these little walking steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2963.699s">Not</a> running steps, walking steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2965.46s">And</a> that's what they did to get it going. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2967.261s">We</a> can do the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2968.201s">You</a> can go to Stoneham. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2969.501s">Look</a> what they did to an old movie theater over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2971.342s">It</a> came alive. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2972.643s">Small</a> as it might be, it's alive, it's well, and it's running. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2976.233s">Medford</a> has the talent, they have the arts, they have the history, and they definitely have the culture to do this in. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2981.614s">So</a> with that being said, Councilor Caviallo, but more importantly, to you, the citizens of this community, and to the Chevalier Auditorium Commission, and everyone who put that together that night, I think it was a great night for the city of Medford, and I thank you, and I'm very appreciative of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2994.196s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3546.059s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3546.519s">Bill</a> on that page, you want page number two, page number two. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3550.741s">That's</a> where your preferred route and your alternate routes are.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3555.342s">The</a> goal routes, which align themselves to be the alternative route, which look like they're way out of, <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3561.627s">the</a> general direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3562.888s">Why</a> is that? <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3563.988s">Why</a> would you not be able to do the preferred route?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3601.846s">But</a> if you were to choose that alternate route for whatever the reason might be, it looks like the way it is here would be much more costly.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3704.793s">On</a> that last point, on the project and the city will negotiate an agreement, you have mitigation in there? <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3708.736s">Is</a> there going to be mitigation?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3724.549s">Before</a> the city council can direct it, how do we know where to go? <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3727.491s">In</a> other words, what would the mitigation be and for what?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7636.483s">I</a> don't want to receive it in place on file, because we asked two months ago for an updated financial <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7640.658s">uh,</a> accounting of just where are we right now between the Republic parking and all the citations that have been dismissed. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7646.381s">We</a> still haven't gotten it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7647.862s">So</a> I don't want to receive it, but I want to report back from the mayor.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_bq-gVu-g8qk/2025-03-21_bq-gVu-g8qk.html">Medford City Council - August 11, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=377.887s">So</a> on the motion of approval, uh, Councilor Penta, um, Mr. Rumley, can you answer a question please? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=390.599s">The</a> city saloon sitter approaches the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=394.182s">I</a> was looking at you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=394.842s">I</a> couldn't get the words out of my mouth. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=396.023s">I'm</a> saying, I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=397.204s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=399.55s">This</a> young lady that's being appointed now, that's a mayoral appointment, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=403.293s">It</a> is, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=404.614s">And</a> how long has the vacancy been there?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=408.257s">Does</a> anybody know how long the vacancy has been?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=415.022s">One</a> full year.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=420.006s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. Solicitor, I know it's not your call, but during this past year, there have been concerns from tenants <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=429.334s">that</a> there was no tenant representative. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=431.114s">So</a> I would hope the young lady becomes very cognizant of all the concerns, whether you agree or disagree, to bring them forward to the board, because there hasn't been anyone there for a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=441.957s">And</a> that's really what's needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=443.877s">You</a> need representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=445.937s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1109.334s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1109.634s">That</a> falls in concert with this.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1217.62s">Very</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1218.381s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1219.542s">You</a> have the amendment, you said?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1223.626s">Why</a> don't we let him finish his presentation?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1473.88s">Mark.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1474.901s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1477.812s">the</a> folks that are involved with the community gardens do wonderful work. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1482.673s">And</a> it's these folks as individuals and a lot of them don't have the space at their own personal residence where they could have this type of a garden. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1492.235s">But</a> I have some concern over this as it relates to number one, I'm passing this tonight without knowing and having a lot of the representatives, you know, and some of the terms here is called plotters. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1501.997s">But</a> one of the things that stands out at me is the mayor has all five appointments. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1508.176s">And</a> since you're asking the council to make a vote of acceptance, not you, but the administration is, uh, I think the council should have one representative of their choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1518.001s">And</a> I think the, the plotters or the garden people, they should have a representative as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1522.684s">Um,</a> and leave all five exclusively to the mirror. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1525.326s">I</a> think at this point in time, I think would not be fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1529.088s">That's,</a> that's number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1530.949s">Number</a> two, it's called the river bend garden folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1533.47s">And</a> you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1533.91s">Exempting</a> them. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1534.771s">They've</a> done a wonderful job for 12 years down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1537.555s">And</a> everything down there really works well. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1540.277s">And</a> they probably have set the tempo as to what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1543.38s">So</a> I guess the question is, what are they doing so right that we need a commission to say we've got to correct something going forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1553.148s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1553.709s">These</a> are questions that I think, you know, and the committee will hold. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1557.592s">Second</a> of all, I have no idea where the $10,000 figure came from.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1586.106s">But</a> the Riverbend folks, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1587.941s">didn't</a> have any kind of a cap. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1589.361s">They</a> just adjusted themselves and paid for whatever their expenses were and have been through the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1594.863s">And</a> if I'm reading this correctly, it indicates over here, um, that not only are these, uh, plot families, um, plot holders along with donations, and they're also going to be charged a fee and inclusive of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1608.706s">Um,</a> the question is if, if I had my particular garden down there and I was working on it, now I'm going to be charged the fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1617.048s">And</a> then, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1618.534s">If</a> we are putting all of these together, and I believe it says, um, and line over here, it says each community garden or group of gardens in the case of gardens, plural of eight or fewer plots, she'll have at least one representative on the commission.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1635.304s">So</a> if they have one representative on the commission, the question then becomes if they have one representative on the commission and the mayor has all five, how do you, how do you get to that one member on the commission? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1645.79s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1646.811s">But,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1647.757s">Just</a> put that aside as a separate thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1649.799s">I'm</a> just concerned over the fact that it's another tax and a fee on people who are doing something voluntarily, who are willing to take a parcel of land, cultivate it, grow it into a garden, for the purposes of which they so choose. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1664.67s">I</a> believe it's on a first come, first served basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1667.712s">And</a> I guess the Riverbend folks are the best example to show you this, that through the last 12 years, they paid for all their expenses themselves, and they've shared it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1676.217s">Now,</a> the question then becomes, if, in fact, we get all these plotters, as they're called, to have to pay an annual fee or whatever it might be, and it goes into a pool, who then makes the determination if one of these locations needs an upgrading and wants an upgrading? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1693.71s">And</a> if I'm in the river bend or X bend, whatever it might be, and I feel that I don't want that money to go there, I want it to stay right here in my own section, how are we going to address this and handle this?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1708.719s">So</a> having no form of function without the ordinance right now, if you go to the one on Winthrop Street, they're basically working on their own. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1714.981s">If</a> you go to McNally Park, they're basically working on their own. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1719.522s">I</a> think it's a good idea to have some kind of oversight, but to have it this controlled and taxing. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1728.785s">To</a> me, it's like another tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1730.578s">on</a> somebody wanting to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1732.198s">It's</a> a fee.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1737.899s">It's</a> a fee.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1739.24s">It's</a> another fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1739.9s">So</a> you're asking someone who never had to pay a fee before, now they're going to have to pay a fee, over and beyond expenses.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1750.262s">No,</a> I understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1751.782s">But</a> you've also been allowed to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1753.822s">And</a> for the last 12 years, there's a group.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1789.646s">But</a> how do you get a fee? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1790.647s">How</a> do we get to this issue of a fee? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1792.148s">Who's</a> going to make the determination of the fee?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1814.927s">But</a> if you already have a group of people that are doing that on their own, what I don't understand is you're saying going from them forward, it's going to come under a commission.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1887.969s">The</a> only real thing, lastly, the only real thing is the $10,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1892.552s">If</a> I was a plotter, and I was to see this ordinance, and I was to see it's going to be up to and not exceeding $10,000, does that mean at any point in time, at any one of these developments, any future development, if an assessment had to be to carry the next person forward, but in my small little world, whether it's on Winthrop Street or wherever, I'm going to be charged an additional amount of money to get to that point? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1916.729s">Because</a> if I understand this correctly, their fees and whatever, it all goes into a pool, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1921.633s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1922.333s">And</a> in that pool, whatever the location might need that's making the request, that's where the money's going to go if the commission votes on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1929.277s">That's</a> correct, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1929.837s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1930.337s">So,</a> like I said, if I'm in my own little world and I don't want it to go there, I want it to keep it on my one subscription, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1937.561s">Councilor,</a> I could tell you this.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1953.987s">To</a> me, a realistic figure would probably be $3,000 to start, because I'm quite sure this is all a minimal. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1959.191s">$3,000</a> is fine by me. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1961.573s">I</a> would move, Mr. President, that $10,000 be reduced to $3,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1964.915s">And</a> let's just see where this gets itself going and how the cost factor goes.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2280.785s">Mayor,</a> two members of the mayor, one from the council and one from the clubs.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2314.451s">All</a> right.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2340.706s">One</a> member from the club is in the three-year term.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2389.529s">And</a> then it revolves out. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2393.865s">At</a> the outset, the council gets one two-year term, because we read every two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2399.507s">The</a> Guiding Club gets one three-year term, and the mayor gets two three-year terms, and he gets the one-year term. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2406.029s">Starting</a> off, that's what you said.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2409.51s">At</a> the outset. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2411.311s">Point</a> of clarification, Mr. President?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3916.662s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3917.482s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3917.762s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3918.803s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3920.723s">I</a> find this very intriguing. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3922.104s">I'm</a> a very nuts and bolts guy when it comes to dollars and cents. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3924.885s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3925.365s">So</a> please just explain to me, you said it costs $6,000 to get to Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3929.567s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3930.028s">Is</a> that shared by the 13 folks that are there now?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3964.497s">OK,</a> so now with that being said, and you folks that are out there working it, what do you actually think it's going to cost to get through this first year?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4011.84s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4012.121s">Now,</a> taking what you just said into consideration, Mr. Clerk—I mean, Mr. Solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4017.485s">Mr.</a> Solicitor, could you come here real quick? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4019.306s">Because</a> she's getting to the nub of my question. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4023.149s">When</a> we talked about the original dollar amount of $10,000, and now we have it down to $5,000, and just hearing the young lady in the back of the hall just basically say what they're purchasing and buying. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4034.297s">Does</a> this mean that the fees that this new ordinance is going to have is going to cover all that so you folks don't have to pay for that or not? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4042.982s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4043.983s">So</a> I guess my question is, what is this money going to be used for for the fees?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4071.504s">I</a> guess I'm just confused because if you folks are donating all your own time, effort, and money into all of this, I think, can you just explain it better?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4139.156s">That's</a> what I think people need to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4142.238s">Thank</a> you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4142.879s">I</a> appreciate that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4146.021s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4146.281s">That's</a> good.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5061.112s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5176.073s">Membership.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5447.875s">Mr.</a> President, two questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5450.156s">Um,</a> number three says the director of office of energy environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5454.377s">And</a> since this is all on Parkland, is there any reason why this is not coming under the park board commission? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5460.132s">rather</a> than the Office of Energy and Environment?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5503.785s">And</a> the second part of number three, it said she'll have the authority in accordance with all. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5509.168s">Does</a> that mean that that individual, whoever he or she might be, can refuse a vote of the commission to make an expenditure?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5523.389s">But</a> it says here, the director of the Office of Energy and Environment shall have the authority to approve.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5533.355s">But</a> I understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5534.136s">It</a> says to approve expenditures. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5535.517s">And</a> if that individual, now or in the future, does not feel that the expenditures are warranted, wouldn't that be in contravention to the commission?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5598.201s">But</a> if this is just a matter of personal choice, that's what I'm concerned about.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5619.331s">So</a> who makes that final decision?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5997.271s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5999.645s">Carol,</a> you guys and your girlfriend, you do a wonderful job. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6002.626s">And</a> I think the idea, it's not about raising the money, it's just the awareness. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6005.228s">People</a> need to know what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6006.968s">They</a> shouldn't be afraid to talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6008.249s">It's</a> like the addiction that we have here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6010.81s">Huge</a> addiction problem, you know, on drugs and what it does to people and how it can kill them. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6015.872s">Same</a> thing with ovarian cancer, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6017.653s">And</a> unfortunately, it's something you have to deal with. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6020.574s">And</a> I think people need to live with it and people have to understand it and people have to accept it and people have to work for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6026.077s">And</a> we have great medical staff here in the Commonwealth of Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6029.165s">But</a> once again, you do our city proud by doing this, make me feel good about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6033.809s">I</a> have life experience as it relates to this, so I thank you for what you do.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6172.487s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6173.448s">To</a> let a citizen in the audience speak as it relates to a problem that she has.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6425.045s">Patty,</a> can you answer this question, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6429.207s">What's</a> the response been back to you from this Park Medford place? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6433.709s">I</a> mean, these people that are from Tennessee that are running this place.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6502.082s">I</a> think the fact of what you're saying just represents the failure within the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6510.302s">The</a> city of Medford is equally responsible for you getting those tickets, because if they're giving out more permits than the spaces are allotted, and they're not making provisos for it, what they're doing is they're grabbing the money, just like this group from Tennessee are, taking the money, and they don't really care where it's coming from and how. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6526.953s">It</a> doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6528.354s">This</a> does not cultivate a business community at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6531.856s">Bad</a> enough that the kiosks are doing what they're doing, and now they want to put kiosks in the parking lots, which again becomes another issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6537.628s">The</a> fact of the matter is that you are a legitimate business person and you should be treated the same as everyone else. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6543.193s">But</a> for that person to indicate to you because they're carrying heavy boxes, how do they know that that person's carrying heavy boxes as compared to what you carry or what you don't carry? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6552.2s">It's</a> absolutely wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6553.421s">And</a> that's the problem with this whole system. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6555.923s">It's</a> an out-of-state company and it's not in-state. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6557.865s">They</a> take 68% of our money and they run with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6560.327s">The</a> fact of the matter is, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6561.817s">It's</a> anti-business, it's anti-consumer, it's anti-friendly. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6564.738s">There's</a> no reason for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6566.758s">So</a> as a business community, I would hope that the Chamber of Commerce recognizes this because they have a big stake to play in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6572.98s">The</a> Chamber supposedly is the spokesperson for all the business people. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6576.861s">And</a> as a business person and as a member of the Chamber, if in fact this is going on, somebody needs to speak up. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6582.583s">It's</a> quite obvious you're not going to get it from the Conor office because that's his program, this is what he wants. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6587.584s">But</a> this is the only place people can come to speak about this and understand and recognize the fact <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6591.912s">that</a> this is wrong, this is so terribly, terribly wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6595.674s">And</a> if I were you, I'd probably look at the, I would probably go to the city solicitor and say, before you entertain anything legal or otherwise, this has got to stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6604.779s">Because</a> if he is representing the city of Medford as legal counsel, and the city of Medford is issuing these permits, knowing that there are not enough spaces, and they don't do what you said, which is very simple, just park on the street for the time period in question, then what are you supposed to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6621.399s">You</a> can't do anything other than get a ticket, but the city can do something about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6625.922s">They've</a> changed the amount of kiosks. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6627.664s">They've</a> changed the dollar amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6631.466s">We</a> can go on and on in this whole subject matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6633.968s">It's</a> not good, it's not healthy, and it's not business-friendly. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6636.45s">It's</a> not consumer-friendly. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6638.391s">And</a> I'll sit here and say, I apologize for your problems that you have, because this is just so terribly wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6646.357s">And</a> hopefully, after the first of the year, this will be changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=6649.563s">This</a> will be changed.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7685.21s">Chief.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7686.78s">I'm</a> going to greatly disagree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7688.34s">I</a> don't appreciate that last statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7690.481s">If</a> you have a job that you have to be out of the square in every 15 minutes, maybe you should look for a different job.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7698.002s">Well,</a> you know, if somebody wants to be in Medford Square for location, I don't care if they were in there every five or 10 minutes, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7703.323s">The</a> problem is there was a legitimate taxpayer citizen came up here to tell you her concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7708.124s">To</a> me, the nub to the whole matter is if a business person can park in front of their place, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7714.508s">because</a> allegedly they're carrying heavy boxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7717.17s">Who</a> was he or who was she to make a determination as it relates to another business person? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7721.634s">That's</a> number one.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7724.877s">You</a> heard it tonight, all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7725.858s">I</a> just heard that tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7727.019s">But</a> this is new. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7728.34s">We've</a> had a multitude of problems with this company since they've been in here, dating back to when they first started in October, when the contract was signed, and they officially took off on January 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7737.828s">And</a> then it took from January, and we heard they were going to go in March, and then we heard they were in May. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7742.408s">It</a> wound up until the end of July before they even found their way over to the senior center to explain to the seniors that they were going to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7749.793s">We</a> have kiosks on High Street, as you and I have spoken about, in front of two-family homes that don't belong there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7755.396s">We</a> have kiosks that are going to go in parking lots where the signage hasn't even changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7759.799s">The</a> parking lots are supposed to be three-hour municipal parking lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7763.542s">And</a> now you're going to put a kiosk in there with signs that say 15 minutes, 30 minutes, one hour, and two hours, all in the same parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7772.179s">How</a> is a kiosk going to address that? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7774.12s">How</a> is anyone supposed to figure that out? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7776.262s">You</a> tell me. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7776.922s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7778.624s">To</a> me, I told you, Chief, they got to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7781.235s">It</a> is unfriendly. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7782.236s">It's</a> unhealthy. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7782.976s">It's</a> poor for business. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7784.197s">We</a> are not like downtown Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7786.138s">We're</a> not even like Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7787.679s">We're</a> just like Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7788.68s">We</a> want to get ourselves back in action. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7791.001s">We</a> want to get a downtown vibrancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7792.802s">We</a> want to get all our little cities and towns, the sister cities that make up this community, to have a collage of types of businesses that entice people. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7800.667s">The</a> whole idea was not revenue enhancement. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7803.209s">It</a> was revenue enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7804.79s">And</a> if you had revenue enforcement, maybe every two hours, and that's more than enough time to be on the street, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7809.793s">and</a> the cars were ticketed, and they were tagged, and maybe they were told, the message will get out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7813.938s">You</a> don't need more than two hours in most of these businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7816.46s">Hairdressers,</a> for example, in West Medford, some of them go maybe two or three hours, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7821.226s">And</a> because of the concern that was brought up by the city, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7825.602s">that</a> it was the city people that were doing the signs and that was against the union. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7829.063s">I</a> mean, the company was doing the signs and the city should have been doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7831.864s">It's</a> a union contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7832.985s">They</a> haven't even changed the signs yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7834.765s">So</a> now you're going to be put these kiosks in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7836.386s">You're</a> going to be charging people after two hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7838.367s">You</a> got to tell them to move a car. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7840.007s">And</a> the most stupidest thing of all of this thing is how do you park yourself in a spot? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7845.09s">And</a> you only can be there for two hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7846.791s">And</a> if you put the money in there, you get a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7848.892s">But</a> you can move up one more spot, because the GPS system tells you it's OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7853.274s">And</a> you can sit there for another two hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7855.115s">And</a> if you come from out of state with an out-of-state plate, it doesn't take it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7858.137s">You're</a> automatically going to get a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7859.938s">There</a> are so many frailties. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7861.119s">They're</a> not open on a Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7862.98s">Everybody</a> else gets a ticket on a Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7865.021s">They're</a> not open on a Saturday for someone to go there and have a concern, whatever the concern might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7871.064s">To</a> me, they're nothing but out-of-state hustlers <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7873.268s">They're</a> bounty hunters, they get 68% of whatever the profit is, for what? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7877.469s">To</a> cause all this confusion, animosity, and concern? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7880.47s">No,</a> Chief, it's not good for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7882.331s">You're</a> my friend and I told you this before, this is not your job, not your responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7888.273s">It</a> doesn't belong in your bailiwick, it belongs in a commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7891.774s">It</a> doesn't belong in the diversity director of this city to be the hearings officer for someone who might get a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7898.036s">It</a> doesn't take two months for tickets to be heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7900.777s">That's</a> insanity, that's crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7903.14s">And</a> if somebody wants to go there, and it's closed on a Saturday because they can't get there on a workday, that's not fair either. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7910.447s">But</a> it's OK for them to give tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7912.268s">And</a> if you don't like it, we'll appeal it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7914.03s">You</a> know what happens on the appeal process? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7916.072s">Somebody</a> says, I'm not coming back. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7917.553s">I'll</a> pay it, but I'll never come back here again. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7919.355s">Go</a> to West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7920.596s">Go</a> to South Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7921.297s">Go</a> to Haines Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7922.558s">I'll</a> leave the name of the personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7923.839s">One</a> particular business is off 8% to 12%. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7925.3s">8%</a> to 12% because of that crazy chaos. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7929.327s">And</a> you know where they go? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7930.247s">They</a> go down the street where they say, like saying business, and there's no kiosk. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7934.429s">You</a> tell me how that's fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7935.749s">It's</a> not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7937.07s">And</a> you know it's unfair, and I know it's unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7939.811s">That's</a> why this whole thing is just not good for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7943.512s">And</a> if the city administration, before he bows out, recognizes it and says, I made a mistake, let's correct it, let's get rid of it, and come in with a program, I will stand here and publicly compliment him. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7953.456s">I</a> said that to you before. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7954.676s">I</a> will stand up publicly and compliment the mayor for recognizing the mistake that he made. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7959.587s">and</a> correcting it because he doesn't want to hurt the business people. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7962.409s">It's</a> definitely not good for the taxpaying citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7966.011s">Go</a> into the shops in Medford Square and ask them what they think about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7969.313s">Go</a> ask the customers what they think about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7972.355s">Why</a> should I go and worry about it? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7973.856s">I</a> was with a lady last Friday in Haines Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7977.118s">The</a> poor woman went into the shop to get her clothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7979.8s">She</a> comes out with her clothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7981.201s">She</a> had 18 minutes left on her ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7983.542s">And</a> right number, 18 minutes, and she still got the ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7987.004s">That's</a> not the first time I've heard that story. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7989.105s">You</a> don't like it, appeal it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7990.767s">Well,</a> that's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7991.567s">Maybe</a> there's something wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7992.528s">If</a> these things all run off the sun, maybe the sun isn't working right, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7996.89s">It</a> certainly doesn't work right for those solar compacts that Waste Management has. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8001.173s">The</a> doors are open and the rubbish is all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8004.195s">So,</a> Chief, you're my friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8006.356s">I</a> like you, but I do not agree in this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8009.778s">It's</a> a complete disaster to the operation of this community.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8139.095s">But</a> chief, if we really want to be business friendly, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8142.43s">and</a> we're comparing a business-friendly to a commuter pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8147.131s">Why</a> don't we just cut back on the commuter passes and give more of the business passes, and at least if you have given out 134, you have 134 spots.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8212.461s">And</a> West Bedford Chief, on Playstead Road, as you know, you're lucky if there's one car there during that day, that $5 parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8219.007s">And</a> all those people that were parking there now have put themselves into the neighborhood, OK?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8273.674s">I</a> think Councilor Marks alluded to this fact a few months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8276.462s">where</a> they have these handheld devices that'll acknowledge how long the car is there, and it comes up, and it just comes right off the computer handheld. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8284.745s">They</a> have that in Somerville in spots where they don't have meters because the people are walking by, and they have a person in each one of the squares.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8327.366s">But</a> Chief, all we're asking for is to start off small and just work our way up to it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=8336.414s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9206.976s">Let's</a> do this one more time. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9208.796s">On</a> an annual basis, we are charged a water and sewer dollar amount from the MWRA, correct?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9220.119s">And</a> that assessment, and that's a result of what we as a community use for water by cubic feet, and we're back charged on the sewer side at 120% of the water bill.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9244.248s">But</a> it comes out to the charge of 120% of our water bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9248.79s">Now,</a> you're asking us to vote for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9251.971s">I</a> know we have the committee to hold tonight where there was a whole bunch of explanations as to where and why these things are going. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9257.813s">And</a> of course, my question is, why didn't we just do this earlier? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9261.385s">We're</a> only sitting on $7.5 million of money, but that's beside the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9266.167s">Just</a> looking and trying to understand this, if 45% of this loan is going to be a grant from the MWRA, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9277.232s">That</a> is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9278.013s">The</a> remaining 55%, which is $1,166,000, has to be repaid. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9279.413s">That's</a> correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9279.894s">So</a> as we are repaying them, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9291.19s">during</a> the next five years, we're also going to be assessed by them in the next five years for water and sewer charges, correct?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9299.974s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9301.514s">So</a> in essence, since we're already being charged an assessment for what we're using, we're really not getting this money for nothing because we're being charged. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9314.439s">And</a> even though this is an isolated project, which is costing $2.1 million, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9319.478s">we</a> have to pay back $1,168,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9320.878s">And</a> I've been thinking about that from the time we left that room till over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9326.62s">I</a> think the city has one of two options. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9330.14s">They</a> either go this route or rather than saying, just pay it off over a five year period of time, since we're going to be taking it out of the sewer account for which is half of the water and sewer account. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9346.224s">Why</a> don't we just pay it off the first year? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9348.14s">You're</a> going to have to pay it off one way or the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9351.581s">So</a> I guess my question then comes to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9354.502s">I</a> would probably move to amend not one to five years, Mr. President, pay it off within the first year, because you have to pay it off no matter what. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9363.604s">I</a> wouldn't want to wait and procrastinate over five years and realize that I would want to know what my balance is now to go forward on any future endeavors that this might reveal. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9373.247s">You</a> said one to five years, correct?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9377.352s">Up</a> to 1 to 5 years, we could repay this back.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9384.175s">It's</a> a 5-year repayment. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9385.076s">So</a> we can pay that anywhere up to 5 years.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9392.939s">I</a> don't care about the 0%. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9394.88s">I</a> understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9396.081s">But</a> we're going to have to pay it back one way or the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9398.202s">So</a> why procrastinate and go through a 5-year, $275,000 deletion? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9402.924s">I</a> would rather have it taken out now and understand what my balance is. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9405.858s">to</a> go forward on other projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9407.919s">Because</a> if something comes up of a major concern, I'm going to then have to worry about $275,000 for year 2, 3, 4, and 5. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9415.363s">And</a> I don't want to think about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9417.224s">So</a> the more I keep thinking about it, we're already being assessed on an annual basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9422.927s">And</a> if we're going to be assessed for the next five years on the sewer charge, and we're paying them back the money that they're loaning us, we're still paying out on their sewer portion of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9434.388s">because</a> we're being assessed. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9435.509s">So,</a> with that being said, I'm going to move, Mr. President, that since we are going to accept the grant, that we pay it back year one — within year one of this five-year loan. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9447.955s">Is</a> that what you call it? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9449.016s">A</a> five-year loan moratorium? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9449.896s">Is</a> that what it is? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9450.337s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9450.437s">DeParle</a> That is a five-year loan. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9451.237s">Mr.</a> Schultz Within the five-year loan. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9454.099s">And</a> I move on that question, Mr. President, because I just think, you know, it terminates the whole issue of over a five-year period of time, and it also terminates the fact that over the next four to five years, after the first year, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9464.58s">we</a> have to delete $275,000 out of that account. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9467.942s">Since</a> we're going to have to pay for it anyway, we might as well just get rid of it up front and deal with the remaining balance that we have.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10770.399s">That</a> be paid within the first year because if we're going to delay it over a five-year period of time, I think what that's going to do, I think that's going to <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10778.901s">limit</a> whatever might become as a future project by almost a million dollars and I would rather know up front that that million dollars was gone beginning the second year and just dealing with the residue that's there because I don't want to deal with an uncertainty of a particular project in years two, three, four, or five.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10898.214s">It's</a> within the five year period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10899.955s">You</a> forgot the five years.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10902.237s">You</a> forgot the five years.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10911.332s">No,</a> that's the committee paper that was amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10913.892s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=11010.146s">What</a> had happened was, yes, the council voted for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=11012.428s">It</a> was taken out of the budget, and the rates weren't supposed to go up. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=11015.33s">But</a> the Water and Sewer Commission changed the rate structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=11019.128s">into</a> three separate tiers where before they were never. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=11021.89s">So</a> as of last year, after our vote, the mayor empowered them to change the rate structure, for which they've changed twice since last year.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=11908.012s">How</a> wide is the trench going to be?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=11936.845s">So</a> you're going to be almost in the middle of the street.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=11950.296s">I'm</a> going to put a condition on here, Mr. President, that in six months that the city review the street opening to make sure that there were no depressions, because <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=11959.822s">The</a> problem with you folks lately, not you, because you're not digging the hole, is your company comes in and digs holes, and within six months, they just become depressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=11969.108s">And</a> they sometimes can cause some of these potholes that are existing on some of these streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=11973.872s">So</a> I think we also have to look at, Mr. President, the bond amount that the city is charging right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=11982.017s">I'd</a> like to raise it to $100,000 that your company has to leave here within the city of Medford, because if these streets need to be repaired, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=11989.671s">You</a> guys opened it, you should repair it to the way you found it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=11993.753s">There</a> are so many streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=11995.134s">You</a> go up to Doonan Street, you go up to Hillside, you go up to Fulton Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=11999.716s">You</a> guys are all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12000.877s">I</a> know you have to do work, but whoever is filling your potholes or whoever is filling your trenches, you leave a lot to be desired. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12009.533s">That's</a> just me talking on another area.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12012.394s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12012.694s">Move</a> approval with that condition to the city.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12037.502s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12038.803s">No,</a> to the City of Medford, no, to the City of Medford for repairs if they become deficient.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12461.43s">12</a> o'clock, September 1st?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12538.812s">Eddie,</a> you just said, I don't know if it was a slip. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12542.473s">I</a> don't know if you made a slip. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12544.133s">Did</a> you say you can come in up to 12 o'clock on September 1st to get an absentee ballot?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12561.677s">So</a> what happens to all these <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12563.202s">Service</a> people that are overseas, they have to get their ballots when? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12567.005s">Well</a> in advance. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12569.006s">People</a> who are overseas, out of state, they have to get these ballots to you well in advance. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12573.769s">They</a> have to be there before September 1st.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12577.752s">By</a> 5 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12578.793s">Now,</a> when do you open up those ballots?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12582.995s">The</a> ballots, the absentee ballots. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12584.917s">When</a> do you open them up?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12593.04s">OK,</a> but what about the ones that you have to wait till the end of the day when the mail comes in? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12597.063s">When</a> do they count, to the next day?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12607.232s">So</a> whatever mail you get on September 1st, that day, election day, you bring to the respective polls? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12614.158s">That</a> would be too late. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12615.499s">Well,</a> then how does it work? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12619.165s">If</a> you get the mail later in the day, how do you get it to the polls by 8 o'clock for them to count it?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12627.627s">That's</a> what I just said.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12632.929s">You</a> have the mail up to September 1 on that day.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12652.825s">So</a> nothing's counted the next day. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12654.405s">Everything</a> is counted that night.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12658.966s">Overseas</a> ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12659.646s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12659.967s">That's</a> another.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13048.041s">Well,</a> we have Panera, Snappy Patty, not Snappy Patties. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13051.182s">What</a> is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13052.522s">Smashburgers.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13053.443s">Smashburgers</a> and noodles and noodles going down over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13061.184s">This</a> is really a disgrace what's going on because it's alleged that it's contaminated soil. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13066.065s">It's</a> been covered up and re-covered up, you know, on hot, warm days. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13069.906s">And</a> when the wind blows, that dirt is going all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13072.887s">There's</a> got to be a reason why. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13075.008s">or</a> a problem why that dirt has not been removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13077.65s">I</a> mean, how do you have a triple business development take place over there and have this amount of dirt stay there day in and day out, month in and month out? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13085.834s">So,</a> Mr. President, I'm going to move that the building department and our health inspector go down there, tag them, find them, do whatever it takes, because this is absolutely unacceptable as part of a business project development here in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13100.063s">And</a> if the city was on top of this, we wouldn't even be discussing this, but it's quite obvious. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13104.602s">that</a> there is something wrong there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13105.662s">They</a> just, once again this past week, covered it with more new type of clear plastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13110.604s">And</a> I don't know, I can't answer it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13112.485s">The</a> poor people across the street, the lady who's across the street, she's beside herself. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13116.587s">She</a> just can't understand what's going on over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13119.668s">And</a> so is it the responsibility of the three people? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13122.989s">Is</a> it the responsibility of the people that own the parking lot? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13125.27s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13126.19s">But</a> it's there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13126.75s">And</a> it's the first time in all my years serving that this amount of dirt <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13131.251s">has</a> hung around after projects gotten started, while the project continues to go forward, and the dirt continues to stay there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13138.016s">So</a> Mr. President, I ask that we move on this expeditiously. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13141.598s">I</a> know we don't meet until the end of September, so I don't want to wait till then. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13144.901s">I</a> think this needs to be resolved immediately, and the fines need to be assessed. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13148.603s">Go</a> ahead and do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13149.584s">The</a> city should go ahead and do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13150.725s">But</a> the fact of the matter is, it doesn't belong there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13153.507s">So</a> I move the question and roll call vote.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13160.827s">the</a> Board of Health and the Court of Enforcement, and the Billing Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13163.549s">I</a> said that, the Board of Health.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13589.094s">No,</a> we had talked about it, but I just want to make it as part of the official resolution that these kiosks that are now going in there, the proper signage has yet to be put into the parking lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13599.519s">I</a> mean, I don't know how they can do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13601.08s">Once</a> again, people are just being taxed <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13605.208s">impositioned</a> by these kiosks from these out-of-state bounty hunters. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13609.813s">And</a> there's just no sympathy being left out there for people who don't understand the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13615.879s">At</a> the same time, all they want to do is just keep taxing the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13619.182s">And</a> this is not the way our city should be going. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13621.224s">Again,</a> like I said, it's not good for business. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13624.047s">So</a> I don't know how you can set up these programs, especially when <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13627.697s">Parking</a> is supposed to be three hours in the municipal lots, and these kiosks are now going to be regulated to a maximum of two over 15-minute increments. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13635.963s">Signage</a> isn't properly put up. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13637.645s">So</a> I'm going to refer this, Mr. President, Madam President, to our parking commission and Republic Park, and also ask, as a tag-on to this, that they entertain Saturday operating hours at Park Medford on Main Street and Medford.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13657.199s">I</a> want, as a tag along to this resolution, relative toward the unacceptable use of these kiosks in the parking lots, to request also that they entertain staying open on Saturdays as a regular business working day. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13673.291s">Park</a> Medford.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13681.877s">Roll</a> call vote, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13699.389s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13699.949s">The</a> parking meters in the municipal lots are not ready to go, because the signage is not ready, which is supposed to be for three-hour parking lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13708.676s">And</a> as a result of that, I want that referred to the traffic commission.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13712.539s">Traffic</a> commission.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_eDYkuoJMIno/2025-03-21_eDYkuoJMIno.html">Medford City Council - July 21, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=610.017s">And</a> is this just like an example of having four, or is that what it's going to be just for?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=713.209s">Well,</a> your food is excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=714.17s">I've</a> been there many times. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=715.231s">And</a> I just need to ask you this last question. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=718.313s">On</a> one of your pages here, you have a blueberry muffin. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=721.933s">The</a> best blueberry muffins came out of Jardin Marsh when they were in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=726.176s">Are</a> they as good? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=728.617s">Tell</a> the people.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=907.588s">Quick</a> question. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=910.249s">That's</a> one half. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=910.969s">What's</a> the percent on the remaining portion of the loan?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1150.785s">Just</a> a point of information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1154.627s">Is</a> there any way that we can get a copy of this so you're not reading it, so we have this information ahead of time? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1159.651s">We</a> never got any of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1161.715s">And</a> two members of the council aren't even here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1164.576s">You're</a> asking for $2 million, and you're reading to us what we're supposed to be understanding now. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1170.379s">So</a> I think it would be more appropriate if we had copies of this to understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1175.221s">I</a> mean, this is a lot to digest for you selling this, so, you know.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1186.686s">But</a> it would be interesting for us to know what we're going to be voting on. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1191.668s">and</a> have all the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1193.389s">You</a> have the information there. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1194.789s">We</a> don't have it here.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1327.293s">They're</a> talking to us for the first time about a $2 million project. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1332.015s">We're</a> just hearing about this, trying to understand it while you're talking. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1337.318s">And</a> with two members not being here, Mr. President, I just respectfully suggest that we just lay this on the table until we can get our information at hand for the purposes of understanding it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1349.624s">When</a> was the grant applied for?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1360.424s">But</a> you're talking about what you're going to do.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1363.747s">Yeah,</a> and you're asking us to vote on this.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1368.41s">But</a> you're asking us to vote on it tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1370.492s">You've</a> seen it, you've worked on it, and you know what it's about.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1414.027s">which</a> is November. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1415.448s">But</a> I'll finish Louise. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1416.328s">We</a> have a meeting I think is August 11th.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1418.63s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1419.23s">So</a> we can lay this on the table, discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1421.451s">And</a> when August 11th comes, the council can vote on it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1445.923s">Is</a> there any reason why we had to wait this long?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1451.728s">This</a> past Friday? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1452.889s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1452.969s">And</a> you want us to vote on it tonight because it has to take three readings before August 20th. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1457.153s">Is</a> that what you're saying?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1460.055s">And</a> we have over $7.5 million in a surplus money in our water and sewer account. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1465.981s">I</a> have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1466.641s">For</a> which we wouldn't have to pay any interest on. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1468.988s">There</a> is no interest under this loan. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1471.449s">Why</a> are we rushing into this?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=2279.023s">We</a> asked for a copy of what you applied for. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=2283.047s">You</a> gave us something dated September 16, 2014.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3480.088s">Well,</a> if you're making the request for the money to do the work and you can come up with a figure that's less than what's needed and you're still accomplishing the job, what's the problem? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3493.114s">This</a> grant, I don't see anything in this application other than a date stating September of 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3500.732s">So</a> with September of 2014 and with the figures that are in here, are you using the figures that are in here in 2015? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3508.574s">I</a> don't know.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3519.458s">So</a> you have anticipated projects to be done with a cost proposal, correct?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3524.259s">Where</a> is that? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3524.859s">That's</a> another thing we didn't get.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3533.592s">Well,</a> you know, it's unfortunate, Louise, because you say we will make sure we're going to get them. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3537.675s">You're</a> asking us to vote for something, and you're asking us to tell us this is where it's going to be up to Project 5, and we have to ask the questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3545.519s">Where</a> are the documents? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3546.599s">And</a> you want us to vote on something. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3548.62s">It's</a> really not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3550.802s">It's</a> not an intelligent way to make a presentation asking for $2 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3556.004s">That's</a> my position.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3594.778s">Just</a> a point of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3596.278s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3597.098s">If</a> we don't apply for that, we have over $7.5 million sitting in our own Water and Sewer Enterprise account that can accomplish the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3603.7s">So</a> why would you make anyone want to think that if we don't do this, we don't have the money to do this project, when we do have the money to do this project?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3633.586s">And</a> we already have it, with over $4 million in a combination of over 7 1⁄2 million with water and sewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3638.65s">So</a> since this is a sewer part project, I don't understand what the problem here is. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3645.754s">Beside</a> not getting the information timely like we should have, <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3648.564s">and</a> having a committee of the whole ahead of time to discuss it and understand it and understanding what council along with current has just asked for taking 575 out of the retained earnings portion of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3660.527s">I</a> just don't understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3661.347s">I</a> mean, how do you explain this to the taxpayers of this community that this is the way to do business? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3667.608s">I</a> don't understand this.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3928.948s">On</a> that subject, when we talk about leverage, you're leveraging the taxpayers' money that have been sitting in a non-interest-paying account for many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3935.753s">We're</a> leveraging our ability to borrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3939.476s">We're</a> leveraging the money that the taxpayers have been paying that has accumulated approximately $7.5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3945.34s">This</a> is a very important subject matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3947.582s">Tonight,</a> we had a Committee of the Whole meeting on the CPA, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3952.225s">It's</a> a community preservation act. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3953.847s">Now,</a> if you want to compare that to the $2 million, I think the Community Preservation Act could have weighed it to August, and that could have been our Committee of the Whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3960.388s">This</a> is a matter of the process and the priorities that take place here in this community, and this is too important of an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3966.19s">We</a> have the money to spend for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3968.11s">We</a> have our reserves account of $4.5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3971.111s">I</a> just don't think the process was presented properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3974.071s">When</a> you have to come to a meeting and ask for the information, <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3977.171s">and</a> then they have to go and Xerox it during the course of the meeting and you still don't have all the locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3982.729s">And</a> as Councilor Caraviello just alluded to, <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3984.697s">with</a> the 19 catch basins. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3986.318s">We</a> don't even know which catch basins there are. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3989.32s">This</a> is such an important issue that this council has been talking about for so many, many months. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3994.384s">INI,</a> leak detection, water and sewer construction, and street reconstruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3998.527s">The</a> Winthrop Street Rotary, we had many conversations over that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4001.209s">Committee</a> of the Whole meeting's over that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4003.871s">And</a> tonight we're asking for $2.1 million, quick, quick, quick, because the MWRA is saying that if we don't have this by August 20th, we're gonna lose our-
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4050.317s">With</a> all due respect to my colleague, Mr. President, he had his opportunity to speak and I'm going to have mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4054.221s">And</a> mine is very simply this. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4055.882s">You</a> know, you're talking about talking about it for 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4058.1s">And</a> each and every—for the last five to six years, you've had an accumulated—an accumulated net surplus that never went back to the rate payers in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4065.987s">There</a> was a gentleman over here that just gave you a sighting section of the law that turned around and told you if there was a surplus at the end of the year and there was no ongoing projects—and I think the projects has to be within a 90-day startup period of time—that that surplus was supposed to go back to the rate payers of this community, so they don't have to pay a water and sewer rate increase in their bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4082.582s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4089.341s">The</a> other part of this whole situation is the presentation, the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4094.704s">What</a> do we consider to be important here? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4096.925s">On</a> this particular night, we're talking about $2.5 million or $2.1 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4103.009s">We</a> have to ask for the information, and we still don't have all the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4107.451s">I</a> think it's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4108.772s">We</a> have access to our money and the retained earnings. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4111.235s">I</a> feel very comfortable in going there, and I feel very comfortable in knowing that the ratepayers' money will now be used for something rather than sitting there, as the administration says, the more we keep it in the air, it increases our bond rating. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4122.46s">I'm</a> not worried about bond rating anymore, because the taxpayers, their streets, their sidewalks, their sewer infrastructure is beyond repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4129.343s">When</a> you talk about first time in 10 years, well, where was the city 10 years ago? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4133.665s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4134.226s">Where</a> was the city 10 years ago? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4135.568s">The</a> city wasn't doing what it should have done 10 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4138.211s">You've</a> done all the parks over three times, but you let the streets, and you let the water, and the sewer, and the ironite deteriorate to the point that it is right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4145.981s">No,</a> I'm not going to vote for this tonight, because we do have the alternative, and the alternative is taking out of retained earnings. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4151.828s">And</a> when anyone has to come to that podium and try to force and compel a city council to vote for something because you're in a time squeeze and this council didn't even have enough between itself to figure out to call a meeting rather than wait for the August meeting or the July meeting because of the importance of this, shame on this council and shame on the leadership of this council because we should have been informed about this, had the meeting with the water and sewer people, the city engineer Louise Miller and everyone else concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4178.037s">To</a> put our backs against the wall on something that we still don't know that's dated, and I don't care what anyone says, dated September 2014, still doesn't cut the mustard for me, and I am not going to take its first reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4189.162s">I'm</a> going to use the option that we have in our city revenue, in our city reserves, and the retained earnings of our water and soil.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4261.236s">B</a> comes before 8-0? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4263.857s">It's</a> the amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4265.038s">She's</a> amending the main motion.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4355.861s">Louis,</a> let me ask you this question.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4361.907s">You're</a> saying it has to take its readings. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4364.949s">So</a> if it takes its first read—if it takes its first reading and it's into its second before the third takes place in August, what's the problem? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4376.01s">As</a> long as it's taking its readings, it isn't like it's not taking its readings, it's taking its readings.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4418.544s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4421.805s">Council</a> meeting before the next meeting.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4447.133s">Mr.</a> Clerk, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4448.454s">Councilor</a> Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4449.154s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4527.121s">Mr.</a> President, I'd like to ask Mr. Rumley, if he wouldn't mind, there are a group of folks out here with some children. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4531.603s">They</a> would like to address the Council as it relates to the issue in their neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4536.166s">So</a> rather than go into Executive Session, could you just wait to let them speak first? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4541.296s">You</a> mind? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4541.916s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4542.477s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4551.822s">What</a> is this mysterious matter, Councilor? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4553.963s">There</a> are residents out there that would like to speak on the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4557.165s">Are</a> they on the agenda?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4560.247s">No,</a> you don't.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4567.991s">So</a> it isn't a trick.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6236.961s">One</a> of the things that I heard here tonight was there is an inconsistency of traffic enforcement in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6243.366s">And</a> some of the suggestions offered by Councilor Knight and as Councilor Caraviello just alluded to, these are things that definitely need to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6250.412s">One</a> of the things that I would have a special interest in would be having a truck enforcement unit within our Method Police Department, because there are just so many trucks that are traveling through our community at high rates of speed that that's a serious concern that we have here right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6266.882s">Unfortunately,</a> this administration, you know, has not wished to delve into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6271.805s">I</a> can assure you, after January, it will be delved into. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6275.808s">And</a> as a result of that, we will make sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6279.643s">public</a> safety is looked upon seriously and not just as a temporary political fix, so to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6287.069s">The</a> public safety of this community is the backbone of why people want to live here. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6291.892s">In</a> today's edition, I think it was in the Boston Globe, it said we're in the lowest third tier of people wanting to live here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6301.48s">This</a> is the latest report that just came out today. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6304.362s">And</a> as a result of, pardon me, <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6310.405s">lowest</a> tier. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6317.068s">You</a> really want to know why you're living here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6320.249s">Just</a> because your real estate values are going up, is it because of the school system? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6323.79s">Is</a> it because of the streets? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6324.871s">Is</a> it because of your accessibility to 93? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6326.311s">Is</a> it your accessibility to public transportation? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6329.373s">It</a> certainly has nothing to do with your downtown environment, because there's nothing there. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6333.834s">There's</a> no economic development in these squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6336.355s">They've</a> been laying in abyss for such a long period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6340.926s">We</a> really need to do an awful lot of work as to find out what our city's about and where it needs to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6347.89s">You</a> know, when you talk about Somerville and some of these issues, they've come a long way in a short period of time because everybody worked together. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6355.195s">They</a> put a collective effort together. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6358.036s">Now,</a> there's a gentleman sitting out there, and I don't want to embarrass him, but Mr. Chris DeVita. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6361.719s">He</a> said he was a city planner. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6363.06s">He</a> worked over there in Somerville where they had 12, 14 people at one time. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6367.002s">City</a> of Medford has one and a half people. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6369.098s">This</a> administration only kept one and a half people working full time in that office. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6373.181s">That's</a> a sad commentary to why we don't have development. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6376.343s">We</a> don't have development because there's nothing in this city to go out and develop because there's nobody out there being able to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6382.707s">And</a> I'll just leave you with this last thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6384.568s">It's</a> public safety and streets and roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6386.23s">But</a> this all interconnects with each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6389.592s">It</a> interwines with each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6391.473s">You</a> know, your roads will take you from A to B and B to C and C to D. And that's very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6397.157s">Your</a> kids on the roads, bicycles, <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6398.99s">people</a> traveling in the summertime. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6400.991s">During</a> the summertime, more speeding tickets are given up in the city of Medford because the motorcycle patrolmen are out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6407.393s">I</a> met with them last night and had a conversation about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6410.493s">I</a> think what needs to be done is to have you folks call the chief of police and ask him to put his motorcycle unit in particular areas because you folks know where the issues are. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6420.716s">They</a> try to do the best they can with what they have, but if they're being told where the issues might be, <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6426.283s">Let's</a> see where that goes, and let's just see the response that comes from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6430.004s">That's</a> a beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6430.904s">That's</a> a first step. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6432.104s">And</a> then, from there, you can take a step by saying, hey, you either were responded to, or you weren't responded to. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6438.006s">That's</a> the way we're going to fix these problems, one street, one day at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6441.927s">And</a> if we all work together, it can take place, and it will get done. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6445.067s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6515.065s">Well,</a> does your resolution address that?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9206.307s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9207.127s">Mr.</a> President, it's quite obvious that since this, uh, I believe since March of this year, that unsightly, um, issue is in front of us at high street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9216.772s">I</a> just don't know why our city administration, <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9220.257s">is</a> failing to take immediate action, corrective action on this particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9224.2s">So</a> with that being said, I would like to have the council consider, as soon as this fall comes into place, an ordinance that addresses a situation such as this. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9236.489s">We</a> have the lean and mean program. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9238.71s">If</a> somebody doesn't care for their property, you can go ahead and do it and charge them on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9243.854s">This</a> is a situation where I think the city can just go out there <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9247.016s">and</a> do what needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9248.877s">I</a> have no idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9249.717s">I</a> don't think anybody in this city knows what is wrong with the building, if anything at all, why that scaffolding is all around the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9256.679s">And</a> it's just, it's a detriment, a detriment to business, public safety and public health. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9261.301s">So</a> that being said, Mr. President, I would suggest, I'm going to suggest an offer for our September meeting and that we establish an ordinance that addresses situations such as this. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9271.885s">Now,</a> if it was an ongoing problem that just needed a delay in time, <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9275.482s">and</a> work was ongoing. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9276.462s">That's</a> one thing, but absolutely no work is being done taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9280.723s">And</a> as a result of that, that just absolutely detours from any kind of advancement in making Metro square look better than what it is right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9288.285s">So</a> I move on that motion, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9328.638s">I</a> believe the way the issue runs itself is that if work is taking place, and it's ongoing, and it's continuing — The President I understand no work taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9334.102s">Mr.</a> Sperling There is nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9334.902s">Zero.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9335.403s">There's</a> absolutely nothing taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9336.824s">As</a> a matter of fact, the other day, for some reason or another, either kids did it or something else, there was a two-by-four plank that fell off the scaffolding. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9344.128s">So</a> I don't know how it got up there, whatever it did. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9346.69s">But</a> thankfully, nobody got hurt, and it fell down. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9348.952s">So,</a> with that being said — well, beside the audience, Mr. President — strike that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9353.655s">I</a> forgot to say, I think we move immediately to have the building department take the appropriate legal action. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9358.844s">and</a> our legal department take the appropriate legal action against the landowner on this particular matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9363.947s">Very</a> good.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9535.228s">Mr.</a> President, once again, these out-of-state bounty hunters did exactly what they did on Patriots Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9540.491s">They</a> were out there tagging. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9542.132s">I</a> had a long discussion with our chief of police on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9545.435s">He</a> wasn't very happy as to what they were doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9548.557s">I</a> guess most of these tickets, if not all of them, revolved themselves into neighborhood parking areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9555.542s">And</a> it's just not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9556.943s">It's</a> not right for the taxpayers of this community to be subject to this out-of-state company that the mayor decided to bring in. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9563.49s">And</a> just hustle the citizens of this community out of their money, especially on July 4th, one of the sacred holidays that we have in our country, other than Christmas and New Year's and Memorial Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9577.657s">It's</a> just wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9578.797s">And,</a> you know, it's obvious that they're in here just for the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9581.558s">They</a> really don't care about what our community is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9585.16s">And</a> it's just the wrong thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9587.861s">And</a> I would hope, Mr. President, that we can get the chief of police just to <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9591.703s">give</a> us a report back. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9592.763s">I</a> know he said he was going to have a discussion with the Republic Parking Company about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9598.145s">And</a> as an aside to this whole thing, a lot of the folks that go to this Republic Parking Company cannot understand why they're not open on a Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9608.129s">They're</a> running it like a business, and they're tagging people in the business area, but they're not open on a Saturday for anybody to go in there and to resolve any of their problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9617.213s">So</a> a dual request here is to have the chief report back and also <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9621.015s">to</a> make a request that Republic Park can be opened on a Saturday during regular business hours, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9627.059s">Roll</a> call vote.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9635.484s">To</a> report back. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9638.386s">To</a> report back, you know.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10052.207s">Unfortunately,</a> the contract was signed on July 1st of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10057.818s">And</a> we're just finding out about it tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10059.719s">We're</a> just getting, because it was just scuttlebutt, and we're getting a copy of it here July 21st, 21 days, 20 days after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10069.563s">It's</a> just a shame that this contract, I have absolutely no idea, haven't had a chance to read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10075.406s">When</a> the public hearing took place this past May, neither the mayor nor anyone from the Medford City government appeared at that public hearing on behalf of the ratepayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10085.07s">I</a> was the only elected official there. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10087.068s">There</a> were 10 other residents from this community who spoke on their concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10090.73s">I</a> don't even know if their concerns were even incorporated into this contract, for which I've yet to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10096.192s">The</a> fact that the mayor has signed a 10-year contract obligating Comcast customers for the next 10 years, when the terms right now are roughly running anywhere from three to five years with cable contracts with renewable options, it just doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10114.443s">Since</a> the mayor decided not to hire a new public works director, letting the new mayor come in in January of this year to make that determination, why would he do the same thing for this? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10124.392s">Why</a> would he obligate the community to a 10-year contract when he has failed to do what he needed to do regarding public access here in this community? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10134.4s">We're</a> sitting on over $330,000 in public access money. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10138.484s">We've</a> never received the financial reports from the old Channel 3 station. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10142.958s">never</a> received the minutes, never received the documents from the State Attorney General's office, never from the Secretary of State's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10151.783s">We</a> don't even know if Channel 3 has been dissolved or not, whether it's been accepted to be dissolved or whether it's legally dissolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10157.207s">I</a> have no idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10159.368s">I</a> will address further on, because I'm just getting this document here tonight on peg access, where it sits and where it fits in here in this particular document. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10169.274s">But</a> it's just a damn shame that <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10171.781s">The</a> whole facade of hiring Mr. Peter Epstein from Boston, I believe he gets paid $325 an hour to sit before this community on, I believe, a Wednesday afternoon with 10 folks, including myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10183.864s">We're</a> here to testify, to give our reasons, and not knowing whether any of those reasons were addressed, whether a bona fide research, or even acknowledged to be part of the document that we have before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10196.931s">So</a> anyone who might be a rate payer out there, the only thing I can tell you is, unfortunately, this administration, this mayor, has tied up, once again, your cable contract for 10 years with Comcast, not knowing whether to be bad, good, or indifferent. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10212.48s">And</a> one of the requests were made that the issuing authority go to the legislative body, as they do in a lot of communities, and not to the executive authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10220.244s">So</a> that way, the public hearings would be able to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10222.965s">You'd</a> be able to have an opportunity to talk about it and discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10226.253s">And</a> you'd have more of a reasonable interpretation and transparency as to what could be in your cable rate, in your cable bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10232.816s">I</a> don't know if this is going to cause you an increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10235.077s">I</a> don't know if the senior citizens are going to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10237.479s">I</a> don't know if low-income people are going to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10240.08s">All</a> these things were issues that were brought up at the public hearing this past May. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10246.263s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, again, it's another sad day for ratepayers in this community being saddled with a new 10-year contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10255.096s">And</a> this mayor is just riding off into the sunset, leaving this community without even knowing what the options might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10261.558s">I</a> mean, he signed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10262.938s">He</a> delivered it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10263.798s">This</a> council wasn't apprised of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10265.839s">The</a> ratepayers weren't apprised of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10268.339s">And</a> now we're saddled with another 10-year contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10271.1s">It</a> doesn't speak well for government interpretation with the customer. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10275.501s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10276.301s">Thank</a> you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10277.061s">Councilor</a> Caraviello.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10340.022s">The</a> whole idea of having this was, it was scuttled, but at the time that I sent my resolution to be on the agenda for this week, and now knowing tonight when Mr. Finn turned around and said he had copies of it already prepared, and I'd seen the city solicitor early, and he had indicated, you know, if you want it electronically through email, but I'd rather have the hard copy. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10360.228s">I'm</a> glad we got it, but the sad, the disturbing part about this is, once again, <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10365.688s">You</a> know, why would the mayor sign a 10-year contract? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10368.591s">Mostly</a> all the cities and towns are into three to five-year contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10372.175s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10372.855s">And</a> number two, having no input into this other than the make-believe dog and pony show that took place here in May. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10380.977s">hiring</a> an attorney to come in here and just elicit commentaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10385.338s">You</a> could hire our own city solicitor to come in to do it, or the assistant city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10390.06s">We</a> don't even know if any of these things are incorporated in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10392.441s">And</a> the hour is what? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10394.441s">10</a> past 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10395.001s">We</a> just get this thing at approximately 10 o'clock tonight and to review it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10398.663s">So</a> I would like to review it, bring it up at another time. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10400.963s">Do</a> you want to do it as a separate paper? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10402.904s">Yeah,</a> do it as a separate paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10404.704s">We</a> can receive this and place it on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10406.225s">But</a> the fact of the matter is, this does not bode well <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10410.32s">for</a> cable TV subscribers who have Comcast, who's probably been rated one of the worst companies in the country to deal business with. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10417.183s">And</a> that's not from me. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10418.363s">That's</a> from the Wall Street people.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10668.49s">Well,</a> before we move to the question, if the gentleman at the podium is correct, once again, why do we have to hear this from a citizen if the mayor is already making a determination?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10691.403s">I</a> hear what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10692.284s">The</a> fact of the matter is Councilor Camuso is not the mayor in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10695.085s">If</a> the mayor is making a determination with the high school and the contractor, <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10698.497s">this</a> council which has been asking week after week, month after month, to be apprised as to what's going on, and we have to hear it from citizens in the newspaper once again to read about it, that that's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10709.519s">That's</a> not transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10710.66s">That's</a> not communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10712.96s">That's</a> the mayor once again just doing whatever he wants when he wants, and it's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10717.461s">It's</a> absolutely wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10723.222s">No,</a> I want to report back. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10724.283s">I</a> want to report back from the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10726.145s">If</a> in fact that's true, what is the mayor intending to do with peg access up at the high school? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10733.166s">Roll</a> call vote on that.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2313.606s">A</a> few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2319.028s">Um,</a> there was a discussion early on dating back maybe some two years ago talking about the sewer line from the bridge to the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2329.61s">Is</a> there a sewer line from the bridge to the square?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2342.314s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2342.834s">But</a> there's nothing that goes across the bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2344.696s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2345.556s">Second</a> question basically was, coming over the bridge, there was talk about putting a light at the intersection right there where you could take a left to go up to High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2355.684s">Is</a> there any further discussion on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2359.79s">In</a> other words, moving the traffic.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2364.814s">No,</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2365.094s">I'm</a> talking about a traffic light.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2370.298s">So</a> is there going to be a traffic light that's going to take a left on High Street?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2384.629s">The</a> question is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2385.43s">You</a> go over the bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2387.111s">And</a> you can go right into the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2390.125s">Go</a> straight, or can you take a left to go up High Street without having to go all the way around? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2395.607s">That</a> was one of the concerns.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2399.788s">That</a> is not? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2400.989s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2402.289s">You</a> indicated your reconstruction project goals, opportunity to upgrade existing utilities over the bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2412.293s">How</a> and what are they? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2413.873s">What</a> are these upgradings you're going to be giving?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2427.134s">So</a> you're saying that all these utilities are going to be upgrading a long overdue? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2430.716s">Is</a> that what we're saying? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2431.896s">I</a> mean, I mean, it would be nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2434.617s">I</a> mean, these are questions I'd like to know.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2437.178s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2438.439s">Do</a> you know when the first time was when this whole issue on the Craddock bridge came about? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2442.32s">I</a> was not present. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2443.301s">It</a> was in 2002 and it was offered by council long ago regarding <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2447.162s">the</a> safety and the concerns of the Karatek Bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2449.423s">This</a> is now 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2450.043s">That's</a> a long time to wait about all these concerns, if safety is an issue as it was back then. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2460.508s">Let's</a> go to... You talked about under construction on the traffic management plan, you talked about accommodating traffic, pedestrian and buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2470.473s">And</a> you indicated, quote, it looks like it's going to go underneath the bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2473.794s">You</a> folks have no control over bus routes. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2476.002s">This</a> Medford City Council controls where the bus routes go. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2479.404s">And</a> I think that's something that really needs to be considered, because this council has maybe different ideas, maybe the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2485.707s">But</a> to say that you're going to put it underneath the bridge, where a lot of seniors at 99 and 121 now will have to not only walk down to that ring road and then cross over the bridge to get to it, it would be a lot closer and easier for them if they went to Medford Square and they put it temporarily on River Street, turn that into a one-way. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2504.925s">I</a> believe it's nothing more than a three-and-a-half-minute change in a route that accommodates the people, when, in fact, your construction is completely disrupting the entire business community. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2516.607s">I</a> do not believe the temporary relocation has been finalized yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2520.628s">Well,</a> we had asked for someone from the MBTA to be here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2523.169s">Is</a> there somebody in the audience from the MBTA here? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2528.27s">Is</a> there any reason why that was not communicated to them? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2531.841s">This</a> is an important part. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2533.441s">This</a> is a very important part of this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2536.002s">The</a> bus route. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2537.062s">It</a> accommodates, according to your information here tonight, 300 bus trips a day go through Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2543.383s">That's</a> an awful lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2545.083s">That's</a> an awful lot of people that need to take a bus to get to work or go to whatever they need to do during the course of a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2551.605s">And</a> there are options out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2553.825s">And</a> I wouldn't want anyone in this room to think, and anyone who might be watching, that you folks are going to change that bus route, because you're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2560.157s">This</a> Medford City Council will make the recommendation to the MBTA, because we're the only ones that have the power to make and change bus routes. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2566.981s">So</a> I would hope that you go back and you review that as a very serious component. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2573.966s">Also,</a> talk about, and this is really mind-boggling. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2580.209s">We</a> can go back to 2011 when you said the project was gonna cost 2.5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2583.772s">Then</a> in 2012, it jumped to 8.5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2589.975s">Then</a> in April of 2013, it jumps to $12.7 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2593.896s">Then</a> in June of 2013, it goes down to $10.7 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2598.156s">And</a> now here we are in June 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2600.897s">It's</a> approximately $11 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2602.797s">Does</a> anybody know what the real number is? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2607.018s">The</a> bid price is $11 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2609.118s">So</a> that's the bid price. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2610.198s">That</a> is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2610.698s">So</a> all this in the interim from 2006 coming forward was just speculation. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2614.919s">Those</a> were estimates. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2616.219s">Estimates.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2617.32s">It's</a> a hell of a jump in estimates from 2006 <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2620.059s">$2.5</a> to almost $11 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2622.941s">That's</a> a big change. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2624.501s">Also,</a> one of the concerns, and I believe you're the contractor, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2628.804s">You</a> are, but I mean, he's the contractor. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2630.244s">Has</a> there been any discussion about mitigation here for any damages or anything to help and offset the business community that might be affected by this? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2640.77s">Has</a> mitigation been discussed with either one of you or through the Department of Transportation?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2647.493s">Do</a> you, sir, know anything about this?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2670.036s">So</a> I would have to say no. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2675.239s">So</a> you're saying a project at this scale of $11 million that's going to disrupt <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2680.361s">tie</a> up the city of MidFitness downtown area for approximately three years, and nobody's going to have any empathy, so to speak, toward any type of business or any one business or multiple business that might be either disrupted or put out of business because of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2695.484s">We</a> have a great deal of empathy for the people.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2699.906s">But</a> there's no mitigation.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2705.688s">Sir,</a> we're talking about three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2707.569s">This</a> isn't a one year project. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2708.729s">You're</a> talking about three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2709.93s">I</a> understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2711.03s">That's</a> a long period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2712.771s">Yes,</a> it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2713.912s">You</a> also indicated that you clean up after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2718.053s">I</a> think it was Councilman Mox who asked a question about dirt and dust and disruption and this and that. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2723.678s">Have</a> you folks been before the city's Conservation Commission?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2729.16s">Pardon</a> me?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2731.32s">Today?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2731.9s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2733.241s">But</a> when other businesses have been working in abutting the Karatek Bridge, straight down the river, they had to go to the Conservation Commission first to be told how and what their construction would be and the effect it would have on the river itself.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2758.583s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2759.424s">But</a> while the construction has been taking place so far, nothing has been, you folks or whoever you're employing have done nothing the same as other businesses that had to make sure that anything that fell off the building, any dirt or any rubbish or anything did not go into that, did not go into that river. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2774.647s">It</a> has not taken place yet.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2788.51s">I</a> see it every day.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2792.032s">But</a> you've been there before this morning.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2801.715s">Today</a> is when they first came. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2803.656s">You</a> should have done this before, when you first got the job and you was first awarded. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2807.71s">And</a> you should have known the rules and regulations were on any type of work that abuts that river, that affects the birds and the fish that are in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2818.198s">Like,</a> last weekend, there was tons of fish that were dead in that water after your work took place.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2824.843s">Secretary</a> Nielsen Well, don't tell me please. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2828.686s">Second</a> of all — and lastly, Mr. President,
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2835.09s">Well,</a> you don't have to be insulted.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2836.891s">Well,</a> I'm sorry, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2838.092s">I'm</a> telling you what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2839.233s">So</a> are you telling me I'm not seeing it correctly?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2841.615s">Well,</a> I think you're insulting too, OK? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2844.017s">If</a> you can't stand here, if you can't stand here and answer the questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2847.661s">Councilor,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2849.062s">Yes,</a> sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2849.422s">Now,</a> one last question, and that's this. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2852.084s">And</a> maybe you can answer it or someone from the Department of Transportation can answer it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2856.148s">Can</a> you explain why it's taken almost three years to do 121 feet?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2868.29s">No,</a> the bridge is only 121 feet.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2870.33s">And</a> to do three years for what you're saying.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2921.252s">I'd</a> just like to make one last comment, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2925.493s">I</a> appreciate the fact that you folks are here. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2928.395s">But</a> this council has asked for a long period of time to be updated as to where we're going on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2934.577s">And</a> it's unfortunate that you've started the job, and now we're getting the information after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2939.239s">But</a> I do appreciate the fact that you're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2941.26s">I</a> think you hear what all the concerns might be — public safety, road, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2945.498s">displacement,</a> business displacement, if in fact that be the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2948.88s">And</a> if the gentleman that walked away from the podium is insulted, I apologize, but I'm not apologizing for my comments because my comments are what I've seen and heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2958.345s">So</a> with all due respect to that gentleman, I don't know what to say to you because I would have never walked away from a podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=2967.29s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=4836.932s">The</a> unfortunate part about all of this is the council's asking the questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=4839.814s">There's</a> no one here from the city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=4841.395s">There's</a> no one here from the Office of Community Development. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=4843.577s">And</a> if they are, would they please stand up? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=4846.099s">This</a> is very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=4847.099s">And</a> that's the part that I think is a little bit disturbing right now, because this information, whether it be for public safety, whether it be for the bus routes, whether it be for the parking, or just the fact that I have a telephone number to call, this meeting didn't happen overnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=4859.489s">Thank</a> you for your point of information, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=4860.95s">This</a> meeting was pointed out. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=4861.91s">Councilor,</a> can I just ask one more thing, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=4865.368s">You</a> made his point of information console Sir Councilor yes, you asked for point of information And I would appreciate it and I think would have been appreciated by anyone who watching would have had either the number Officer community development or somebody here from the city administration That's how important I believe this issue is. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=4890.752s">Thank</a> you console console longer current are you through?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5128.605s">I</a> believe there was some questions asked by the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5130.325s">Can</a> we move that we get an update on this bridge process on a monthly basis? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5135.187s">And</a> can we have a phone number that we would be able to have in a project person as a contact person? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5140.978s">So</a> if anyone were to call us or the city clerk or any citizen, um, and they can't get ahold of anybody because they close here at 12 o'clock on a Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5148.806s">So</a> for the weekend when it's closed, if they want to call a Councilor on the weekend, and if emergency happens, they can give any one of us a call. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5155.353s">So</a> the number will be made available. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5156.914s">I</a> think that's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5157.755s">Mr.</a> President on that motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5168.749s">A</a> monthly update, the phone number, and the location of where the office is going to be, and the contact person.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5511.441s">I'd</a> like to thank Councilor Caraviello for bringing this up because when he discussed this last week, I don't think anybody really knew the magnitude of the impact that this could have on neighborhoods, and especially if you're abutting this particular situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5524.645s">And</a> through his follow-through with the community of Plymouth, I think he just highlights the fact that sometimes, unfortunately, when pieces of legislation are written and they're enacted, one little word can just change the whole agenda of what somebody might have to offer and what they want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5541.59s">I</a> want to thank you, Councilor Caraviello, for going forward with this, because I think what it does, I think it's a safeguard into our community, into our neighborhoods, into the little children who might have to be exposed to this, because this is an enterprise that's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5553.712s">This</a> is a scandalous for-profit enterprise by people who have no care about our community and the concept of morals that our community should have. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5564.037s">So</a> with that being said, and I know our city solicitor is here, I'm quite sure you're going to be looking into it, and I'm quite sure that we can come up with something.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5575.182s">It's</a> a residential.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5585.984s">And</a> the sad part about this, as we're talking about it, the one that's on Central Ave, if you were to drive by, the windows are all covered. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5593.005s">You'd</a> have no idea what the heck's going on over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5595.986s">And</a> some of the individuals inside, some of the people that are running it may not be that nice to you if you were to ask them questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5602.907s">Why,</a> and what are you doing, and what are you asking questions for, why are you taking pictures, and whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5607.288s">So</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5607.768s">This</a> is a good move. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5609.069s">This</a> is what you call a good neighborhood protection move. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5611.545s">It's</a> a good public health and public safety move between our chief of police and our city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5616.309s">I'm</a> quite sure that we can manage, as plummeters manage, to write something that, unfortunately, until the state decides to change its law and its state statute, we can do it here in our local community. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5626.136s">So,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=7068.678s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=7069.858s">You</a> made a comment about next to Bistro 5, you could put a strip joint. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=7073.132s">City</a> of Medford has what they call an entertainment zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=7075.214s">There's</a> only one spot in the city and that's on the end of Mystic Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=7078.117s">That's</a> the only place that something like that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8289.328s">I</a> think Mr. Sincardi asked the clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8292.595s">There's</a> only there's two ways you can record yourself here in the city as a corporation or What was the second one? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8302.78s">But</a> if you get a business certificate it has to have an address on it and has to give you the name of the person Okay, so apparently our index at City Hall does not go by name It doesn't go by it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8313.285s">Can</a> it go either way by name or address?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8327.652s">No,</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8328.773s">I</a> think what he's saying Eddie is the fact that is there any record that shows that somebody either is a business operating or.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8343.602s">It's</a> not the type. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8344.423s">It's</a> the name of the business and the street location. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8346.684s">So</a> if you don't, if you can't get it out by the name of the business, can you go by, if you went into our office right now, could you put up a two, uh, what's the name? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8354.888s">What's</a> the address over there? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8355.929s">Well,</a> it's, it's 34 Riverside and your business and your business thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8361.452s">Would</a> it come up? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8362.532s">Can</a> you get something come up on your computer?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8382.945s">And</a> do they have a name on, do they have anything at that address?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8390.987s">No,</a> the owner, that's not the owner of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8392.447s">That's</a> the renter of the rent, right?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8413.792s">Then</a> the question is, is there a city solicitor? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8415.473s">Is</a> he still here? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8416.194s">Mr.</a> Mark. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8422.659s">I</a> know you came in after the fact, but we went through with the chamber some years ago, painstaking to change all these ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8429.721s">The</a> covering of the window, 40% was max.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8434.043s">The</a> sign ordinance, excuse me, 40% was max. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8435.664s">I</a> don't know if you've been down there, but this is completely sprayed. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8439.125s">You</a> cannot see nothing on this one here in Central Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8442.527s">Is</a> that in and of itself enough of a public safety issue and a violation of our municipal law?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8797.825s">No,</a> I just agree with Mr. Sincarly because I've been over there to see and I saw it in Medford Square and I don't understand where the state legislators are on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8808.728s">I</a> can't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8810.068s">This</a> is something that would take it out of their bailiwick and they wouldn't have to worry about it as a state piece of law. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8814.369s">It'll</a> come back to the local community and the local community. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8816.729s">would</a> make its decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8817.969s">You're</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8818.329s">And</a> then it would be on the back of every one of the seven councils or nine or 11, depending on what the form of government might be and the legislative body might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8824.751s">I</a> mean, this has no redeeming social, economic, financial, no value at all to any community for whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8831.973s">This</a> is not Las Vegas if you want to go out there and engage in this type of business and pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8836.614s">So</a> with that being said, I think the council is quite uniform on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8841.735s">I</a> think the council should send a vote to our state senators. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8844.866s">and</a> our three representatives that are part here of the city of Medford, and ask them to file a bill, take a leadership position on it, file a bill to eliminate this particular clause that's in the state law, and for whatever the terminology might be, just bring it back here to local control, and maybe whoever the other gentleman was that came up here and talked about changing our zoning ordinance, maybe we need to take a look and revise the wording in our zoning ordinance that not only addresses this, or any other type-like businesses that might appear in the future, because they may take the word Asian out, and may call it international, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8874.745s">Who</a> knows what it could be? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8875.906s">And</a> if they do that, they beat around the law, and they don't have to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8879.329s">So</a> I think this is one issue that completely belongs in the control of the local community. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8884.113s">And</a> you can't say it any other way. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8887.055s">That's</a> where my vote would go. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8890.999s">Move</a> approval, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8892.22s">Roll</a> call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8892.88s">Have</a> it forwarded to our state senator and our three state reps. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8895.562s">I</a> move the motion to make a motion by Councilor Gabriello, as amended by Councilor Penta,
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10211.297s">Councilor</a> Pente. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10213.038s">A</a> few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10214.519s">Louise,</a> one of the things that we had asked for was our electrical department. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10219.112s">that</a> the superintendent wise, um, contact national grid to address the lack of lighting at Wentworth street rotary. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10225.596s">The</a> response is that the lack of lighting is due to the removal of one street light for construction reasons and will be reinstalled. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10233.281s">The</a> other answer was one street light was struck by a truck and has been struck on more than one occasion. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10237.964s">National</a> grid is evaluating, evaluating whether or not to reinstall due to this location. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10243.527s">Now,</a> have you ever gone to Wentworth circle at nighttime?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10247.75s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10248.711s">Well,</a> if you go there at nighttime, you think you're in the woods, because there's absolutely no lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10253.775s">It's</a> as dark as can be. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10255.837s">It's</a> a huge public safety issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10258.559s">We</a> had asked Mr. Randazzo for whatever it takes to put additional lighting in there while this whole construction is going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10266.085s">Now,</a> I know that they're repaving part of the street in Winthrop Street, but they're still working over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10271.429s">And</a> to have National Grid tell us that they're going to evaluate whether, in fact, they're going to put a new light up, that doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10278.632s">And</a> that's the type of an answer I would have not responded to by saying that. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10283.396s">I</a> would have went out of my way to make sure national grid did put the light up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10286.618s">It's</a> a public safety issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10288.139s">It's</a> a huge factor over there and that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10292.843s">Also,</a> there's some concerns that I had in this budget from four particular departments, engineering, the library, the building and the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10300.329s">And</a> I think we were all educated, at least I was immensely during this past budgetary process, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10305.208s">that</a> these four departments in particular, when asked about their wish list, for which we've been asking each and every year, well, judges knew, as you're aware now, they were all very enlightening to turn around and tell us that they did ask for certain things. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10320.311s">The</a> engineering department in particular, when the engineering director was asked what her wish list was, and she had been asking for this for four years, and how was it done, two times it was verbal, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10334.864s">And</a> two times it was in an email, and she was told by her predecessor not to include it in the budget, because you weren't going to get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10342.986s">Well,</a> how do you deny having four people use one telephone call, one telephone? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10348.727s">How</a> do you deny giving them an extra table to work on, file cabinets, and a computerization system to bring them up to date, or at least to keep them up to date, for a $30,000 to a $40,000 hit? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10358.249s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10361.757s">Paul</a> Mulkey from the building department, when he came up, he was asking for something very simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10365.579s">He</a> wanted to become modernized and more computerized. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10369.142s">And</a> that was costing him maybe $30,000 to $40,000, asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10371.423s">Is</a> the chief still here? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10375.626s">I</a> don't want to put him on the spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10376.767s">But</a> the question was asked of the chief relative to his wish list. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10380.409s">He</a> had never been asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10381.79s">And</a> when it was asked of you on the night of the budget, you indicated that you had just heard it that morning from the chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10388.814s">And</a> here is the department. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10390.258s">that</a> has cars and a building and a whole gamut of issues still not being addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10399.364s">The</a> library, for four years, the poor librarian, and including myself, have been all over him because he's not putting these things into the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10407.689s">And</a> it took a cast of characters from our community to say that they wanted that library fixed and they wanted their recertification to come forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10419.256s">And</a> what had happened? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10420.937s">When</a> Mr. Bryan was there, he was told not to say anything and not to put in his library by your predecessor. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10429.301s">For</a> six years, we went without being certified. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10431.743s">We</a> kept getting these variances and these special privileges from the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10435.845s">That,</a> to me, did not represent what a true budget is all about, because that $225,000, $30,000, or whatever it should have been, should have been part of the daily operating budget that that department needs to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10448.211s">And</a> then lastly, I think the question was asked to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10450.806s">And</a> I don't think I was the one that asked the question, but I believe the question was asked to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10455.329s">Would</a> you have presented the budget the same way you got it to be presented? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10459.913s">And</a> you said no, you would have presented it different. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10462.495s">Because</a> I think you heard about our wish list, a page that had about expensive, a page about salaries, and a page about the whole operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10471.302s">To</a> me, that spoke volumes. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10473.403s">Taking</a> a quick look over to the school department, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10477.948s">whether</a> Roy wants to agree with me or not, for whatever it might be, we had a conversation about the Curtis Tufts School. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10484.589s">Now,</a> the Curtis Tufts School, to some degree, has been a little bit of a bone of contention. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10489.03s">But</a> our own superintendent at that meeting indicated they had to make some changes because it wasn't going in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10494.971s">You</a> can correct me if the words are wrong, but I think that's what you said. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10497.992s">It</a> wasn't going in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10499.532s">So</a> you had to bring in somebody new. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10501.352s">That's</a> okay for 19 kids that are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10504.193s">I</a> believe between 11 administrators and teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10507.334s">But</a> you reward the fellow that's been there for 32 years with a $97,000 brand new job up at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10514.178s">To</a> me, that's not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10515.419s">I</a> don't think that's fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10516.32s">That's</a> $97,000 that could have gone toward education, to a teacher, to books, to materials that teachers probably need. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10523.945s">Maybe</a> you have a difference of opinion with the superintendent, but I wouldn't have done that. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10527.767s">I</a> look at it an entirely different way. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10529.929s">I</a> also look at the fact that when these new school buildings were built, there was a 5% annual <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10537.114s">supposed</a> to be in there for each particular budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10539.135s">Now,</a> Councilor Caraviello, I believe it was three years ago going into his first year, produced a document, not from him, but the school department that showed $1,203,000 of repairs that were needed in that school. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10554.159s">The</a> reason why the schools got themselves in trouble in the first place was because they never kept maintenance up. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10559.921s">And</a> at the rate we're going, we're going to find ourselves in the same situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10563.762s">All</a> I ask for each school, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10565.492s">to</a> be broken down individually to have a 5% inclusion of each school rather than all the schools together and try to figure out how this thing is going to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10575.739s">And</a> the other part for which I, again, disagree with my superintendent, and I consider him to be my friend, but we have a difference of opinion, I just think the entrance to Medford High School does not present itself very good for an educational purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10589.549s">If</a> I'm bringing my child up there from the eighth grade going into the ninth, and I look at that front entrance of that building, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10595.07s">And</a> I'm not going to accept the fact that it was a poor winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10597.992s">It's</a> been like that for a while, with bricks that are broken, door handles that are off the thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10603.515s">And</a> you walk into the, it's not very welcoming. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10606.517s">Medford</a> High has a huge talent pool of students and teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10611.62s">It</a> gives a good education to the people in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10614.962s">But</a> of all the schools that Medford has, that high school gets the bad rap for its appearance. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10621.206s">And</a> as we all know, an appearance can tell a huge story. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10625.657s">I</a> just don't think right now, the way this budget's been presented, and knowing and seeing these department heads tell their particular stories, I don't feel that we're really getting what you call an accurate budget, especially since we just went two weeks ago to have over $1,200,000 in transfers from one department to another. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10643.727s">Are</a> some transfers needed? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10644.967s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10645.548s">No</a> question about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10647.109s">But</a> when one, two, three, four, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10649.974s">five</a> department heads come in there and tell you that they couldn't put in their budget what they really wanted so we as Councilors could understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10657.376s">Maybe</a> we wouldn't have accepted any of them, but all we've asked for for the past many years is show us what your wish list is, tell us how much it's going to cost, and maybe explain to us how you think we can fund it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10669.159s">But</a> when your predecessor tells them not to put it in there and they don't put it in there, that to me is wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10675.821s">And</a> because of that, I'm having a hard time right now telling you <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10679.53s">You</a> know, Louise, whether I'm going to vote for this budget tonight or not, because I don't think it reflects an accurate presentation of what department heads need. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10686.675s">I</a> don't see anything coming back here that says the electrical department's going to get its $40,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10692.52s">So</a> every single employee has its own phone rather than one phone for four people, and a table to work on, and a file cabinet to store things. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10700.906s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10701.266s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10702.507s">I</a> don't see anything in the electrical department that makes me feel satisfied that that one circle is going to be safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10708.165s">All</a> I'm getting is a report back that somebody's accepting somebody else's opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10712.846s">Well,</a> that opinion isn't good enough for me when public safety is at issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10716.566s">When</a> I hear a librarian tell me that for four years he's been stifled from putting in what he wants, and you hear the people from this community who brought the charge back, which forced Amir to automatically, mysteriously find $250,000 from a construction job, when we're sitting on $6.5 million in free cash, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10737.58s">I</a> have a problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10739.46s">And</a> when Paul Moki from the building department tells me all he needs is about 30, 40,000 to upgrade his department to computerize it, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10746.882s">But</a> we didn't hear that. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10748.042s">And</a> when I hear our chief of police tell me as of the morning of the date of the budget, that's the first time you and prior to you, your predecessor never had the opportunity or being invited to talk about these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10759.905s">That's</a> bothers me because I think a lot of the times through the past, this council was led to believe, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10764.914s">When</a> the budget was presented, okay, all the department heads agreed upon it, and maybe we should have asked more detailed questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10772.297s">But</a> this year's budget was very enlightening. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10774.738s">So</a> enlightening to the point that I honestly feel that what you were given for a budget to serve is not a true and honest and accurate budget, because if you're transferring a million dollars at the end of the year, as we've had for so many years in the past, and you just keep adding to your free cash, there is something wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10792.275s">I'm</a> not worried about the bond rating of our community right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10795.696s">What</a> I'm worried about is how the taxpayers are going to be continuously taxed and taxed and taxed. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10802.438s">And</a> I'll just leave you with this one thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10804.598s">We</a> have so much development taking place in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10807.639s">We</a> were told that when in Wellington Circle, when stations landing in there, that was going to be such a boom to the city of Medford and to the taxpayers of this community, we would probably not be looking at a tax rate increase maybe for a few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10821.634s">We've</a> had so much development since then, and again, we are taxed and taxed, increase, increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10828.138s">So</a> maybe development for the sake of development is not working in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10832.701s">Public</a> safety, public works, public accommodations, plowing, all municipal services being put on the backs of the taxpayers to accommodate all this development and their taxes are not going down. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10846.03s">So</a> I thank you for taking on your new role. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10849.632s">I</a> know it was thrust upon you. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10851.874s">But</a> unfortunately, I can't buy what's in front of me right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=10855.555s">That's</a> just my opinion.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11944.685s">Councilor</a> Penter. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11947.087s">A</a> couple of things pop out. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11949.689s">The</a> issue on the kiosks in the square, citations have gone up. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11954.413s">They</a> haven't gone down. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11955.233s">January</a> was 590, February was 1,800, March was 2,393, April was 2,689. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11957.135s">Just</a> in the month of May, it went down by some 300 citations, but they're still issuing over 2,000 of those a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11971.652s">That's</a> an awful lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11972.673s">It's</a> an awful lot of citations. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11974.734s">And</a> as the chief has indicated, and I believe in his report back to us, that some 400 of the 1,100 citations that were appealed were either reduced or they were abated to some degree. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=11988.782s">This</a> kiosk program, as we all know, has been a handicap, in my opinion, to businesses throughout the community as it relates to not being business friendly, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12001.507s">when</a> in fact we could have engaged in a revenue, I mean, strike that, a traffic enforcement program rather than a revenue enhancement program. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12010.029s">I</a> hear what some of my colleagues are saying, but the hard part about supporting a budget like this is the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12018.791s">Louise,</a> you were there because you presented this budget and worked on it with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12025.612s">Is</a> there any reason why in the electrical department for their $40,000 that they were looking for, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12032.135s">not</a> to strike the electrical engineering, the building department probably almost around the same amount, at least the police department, even if he got a couple or two or three cruises, you had a fight for the $5,000 and the Council of Aging budget, you had a fight to get the $227,000, and you added on to make it $250,000 for the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12052.903s">Is</a> there any reason, since you knew that these were concerns from the Council, and before this came back tonight, that you couldn't have come back <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12060.471s">and</a> added this in the budget, and some shape me in a reform, because the budget did increase by $4,800,000 from last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12066.875s">This</a> is almost two years in a row that this budget's increased by approximately $5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12071.617s">So</a> an increase in the budget by $5 million are close to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12074.819s">You're</a> maxing out 2.5% to the max. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12078.722s">And</a> as Councilor Marks just alluded to, what you're doing is, well, we don't want to see this next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12085.365s">But</a> I've heard that rhetoric before about not seeing it next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12088.528s">I'm</a> seeing it here right now for the first year. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12091.989s">And</a> this is not to put it on you, because this is what was handed to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12096.151s">But</a> if one, two, three, four, if five department heads are all saying the same thing, and even if you increased each one of these departments by $30,000 each, that's what, $150,000 that you can't find in the budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12108.835s">When,</a> in fact, you just transferred over $1,200,000 at the end of the year? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12119.231s">I</a> just don't buy into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12121.112s">And</a> just what's happened, unfortunately, with the kiosks and the business people in the community and the last horror show of a lady yesterday with the kiosks and the machine and being yelled at when she went to Park Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12136.475s">And</a> tonight, getting a report back from someone who had to wait two months to get his appeal answered, when I thought the appeal was taking place in this building and Park Medford is still doing the appeals. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12148.029s">I</a> don't know how this works, Chief, but if Park Medford is doing the appeals, when we were told it was being done in this building, there's still something wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12156.672s">I</a> just don't think I'm going to vote for this budget, because to me, it does not represent a budget that represents the quality of life that the people of this community need. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12165.596s">That's</a> just my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12167.037s">I</a> think I'm going to stick to it, because, like I said, this has been very insightful to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12175.603s">to</a> talk to you and tell you things that we never heard before, that bothers me. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12180.547s">It</a> bothers me. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12181.307s">And</a> it should bother you, too.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12289.05s">But</a> in all fairness to you coming on late in the process, had these wish list issues been discussed? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12295.432s">Now,</a> you just got through saying in the building department, you needed more info. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12299.333s">So</a> if this was brought up in February, which I believe is when the building department, why would the questions asked then of him? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12306.095s">Why</a> should he have to come up with it? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12308.375s">If</a> he's telling you what he'd like to have, then isn't that what the budget director does or an assistant to the budget director going into the engineering department? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12316.878s">She's</a> been asking for this for four years.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12335.931s">But</a> when all these department heads indicated that they made the request and they were told not to include it and not to talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12342.375s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12343.596s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Camuso.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12378.859s">Louise,</a> on the library issue of getting ourselves certified, for the last six years we've been getting waivers. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12385.304s">If</a> the money had been included in the budget not to get away, it's good for the first, second year, okay, maybe there was a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12390.989s">But</a> why wasn't the $225, whatever the appropriate dollar amount, included in the budget as part of its operating cost of doing business in the budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12400.216s">Why</a> did it have to be a group of concerned citizens coming forward that finally put the pressure, and with the help of the council, put the pressure to make sure <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12409.028s">They</a> got their money, their certification, and they got more employees, and more of an upgrading in the building.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12431.047s">But</a> that's the whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12432.068s">I</a> mean, if we're supposed to be operating according to laws or rules and regulations, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12438.052s">We</a> shouldn't be looking for a waiver each and every year and just go on a wing and a prayer, because eventually it's going to come to an end. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12445.036s">A</a> true, actual, factual operating cost of that library is its recertification, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12452.2s">Not</a> depending upon a waiver. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12454.422s">And</a> not to have a department head be worried about saying anything, because he's going to get in trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12459.745s">That</a> to me is wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=12461.586s">And</a> I think you know it's wrong, too.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13160.108s">Quick</a> point. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13162.908s">Well,</a> I do, you know, but Councilor Longo just enlightened me about something. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13168.17s">Roy,</a> are you here? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13168.81s">Are</a> you still here? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13170.988s">Quick</a> question for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13172.99s">These</a> are the lowest people on the totem pole, and they haven't had a raise in over eight years, the lunch mothers. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13179.335s">You</a> said you were going to check into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13181.117s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13214.44s">Louise,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13216.001s">I</a> want to ask a question to Louise. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13218.703s">Because</a> I didn't find it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13222.406s">I</a> just went through everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13225.561s">Is</a> there going to be increase in the water and sewer rate? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13228.142s">And</a> I believe you didn't have an answer for us and I haven't received an answer from anybody.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13240.969s">Last</a> year at this time, when we discussed our budget, there was an $800,000 additional monies in the budget to pay for the increase from the MWRA water and sewer rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13251.795s">So</a> are you saying now that the city,
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13355.921s">So</a> you're saying that the water rate, I want to get this straight, that the water rate in the budget that's projected to pay the MWRA is the same? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13362.805s">The</a> sewer is being reduced? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13366.961s">by</a> $117,000?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13380.124s">OK,</a> wait a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13381.024s">But</a> you also said the sewer portion has been reduced by $117,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13383.365s">That</a> is correct, from the MWRA. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13385.506s">So</a> it's not the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13386.326s">So</a> the water is the same, but the sewer is $117,000 less than what's in this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13392.687s">That</a> is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13393.447s">OK?</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13394.368s">So</a> as we speak right now, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13396.347s">According</a> to this budget, if it's passed, there's $117,000 that we haven't been apprised on because we're voting on a budget that's going to have a dollar amount that's $117,000 more than what you're saying right now.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13412.358s">So</a> right now, then that's an inaccurate budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13414.66s">The</a> total amount is inaccurate by $117,000 because you just got saying it was reduced.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13440.758s">The</a> vote of the Council has only been predicated on last year, for example, of the rate increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13445.941s">We</a> right now are voting on this water and sewer portion of the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13449.972s">not</a> knowing what the fee is even going to be, if there's going to be an increase or a decrease. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13453.694s">So</a> that would mean you're going to have to come back at another time if there's going to be an increase, because the Water and Soil Commission don't set the rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13463.26s">They're</a> only giving you the dollar amount what's necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13465.702s">So</a> even with your $117,000 reduction here, if the city decides, after reviewing its consumption and its getting rid of the water, there's going to be a $300,000 increase to pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13479.514s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13479.634s">You're</a> all going to have to come back to the council and ask this council, whatever the dollar amount might be, for an increase.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13515.319s">So</a> now let's just say it doesn't cover it and you need more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13519.482s">You're</a> going to then have to come back to the council.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13522.244s">And</a> right now we're sitting on $7.5 million of surplus money in the water and sewer enterprise account. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13529.43s">That</a> is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13529.931s">Council</a> can still choose to recommend that that money, whatever the increase comes out of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13536.417s">I</a> would move, Mr. President, that the budget as presented with the dollar amount attached be reduced by $117,000.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13622.254s">So</a> on the motion for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13627.496s">Did</a> you or did you not just say that the sewer portion is being reduced by $117,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13631.358s">You</a> just said it from there, correct?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13637.4s">And</a> that would be $117,000 less than what was given to us in that budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13641.462s">That</a> is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13642.499s">So</a> the dollar amount the budget is coming forward with needs to be reduced by $117,000 to accurately reflect the water and sewer in this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13652.126s">Is</a> that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13652.727s">The</a> sewer portion only. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13654.228s">Yes,</a> the sewer portion. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13655.869s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13657.19s">Motion</a> to sever.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13670.36s">Very</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13671.501s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13673.138s">We're</a> not cutting the line items. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13674.499s">I</a> believe the budget director just indicated, and again, she can correct me if I'm wrong, that you just got these figures now, correct?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13682.923s">And</a> the dollar amount in this book that represents the budget is now $117,000 less, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13687.705s">That</a> is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13690.066s">And</a> for this budget to be accurate with its numbers as presented now with the 117 before this vote, this total dollar amount of the budget of $150 million needs to be reduced by $117,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13703.027s">Is</a> that correct, Louise?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13704.848s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13705.708s">It</a> needs to be reduced.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13715.512s">That</a> dollar needs to be deducted from the total.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14456.942s">The</a> 117,000 that represents the actual numbers of the budget presented.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14475.626s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14475.906s">Miller</a> just got through telling us that she just got today, for which none of us knew about this, $117,000 is a number less than what's in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14485.073s">So</a> to have these numbers to be accurate as presented, it needs to be deducted by $117,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14489.317s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14489.437s">Take</a> the vote.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14571.753s">Wait</a> a minute, wait a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14573.434s">It</a> can't be an amendment because the amendment lost.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14708.081s">We</a> just got this. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14709.542s">We</a> just got this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14710.743s">We</a> just got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14711.644s">Yeah,</a> so how can you vote for approval if you just got it? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14714.246s">We</a> didn't get it just tonight.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14724.147s">We</a> just got this tonight.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14728.55s">Just</a> got it now, handed it on my desk tonight.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14746.182s">On</a> the motion, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14750.144s">I</a> think it would be beneficial if you reviewed it to the public so they'd have an idea of what this prevention coordinator is going to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14757.77s">It's</a> been long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14759.191s">People</a> have been waiting for this, so I think you can hit the highlights of it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14857.088s">Job</a> or salary?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14868.634s">So</a> it was in the sixties.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14871.495s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14872.435s">Could</a> you just read at the end, um, the physical requirements?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14897.9s">Yeah,</a> only for one reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14899.362s">The</a> one thing I'm, it doesn't talk about driving to a destination. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14903.625s">And</a> I'm just wondering, is this particular job going to just be completely in-house or is this job going to allow somebody to go to a different location or
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14961.827s">Move</a> the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14962.667s">And</a> I want to thank you for passing this up tonight, because this is the first time I see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14966.089s">Chief,</a> I'd just like to ask you one question in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14967.87s">It</a> makes reference to the police department.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14992.261s">Chief,</a> do you have a copy of this or not?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14996.683s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14997.443s">It's</a> section over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=14998.144s">It</a> says develop jointly with the police, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15000.714s">Programming</a> to decriminalize and foster relationship with those with substance abuse disorders and their families using evidence based upon principles and practices. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15009.416s">Support</a> police on programming and any grant activities related to substance abuse. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15014.477s">What</a> was your interaction with this for this to be included? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15019.739s">In</a> this program.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15049.456s">So</a> for the purposes of this position, are you going to oversee <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15054.898s">these</a> particular police officers who might be designated? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15057.799s">How</a> is this going to work?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15237.262s">How</a> long does it take to advertise? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15240.245s">Was</a> it three weeks, ma'am? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15241.185s">After</a> the third reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15244.908s">After</a> the first reading.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15248.991s">So</a> it can be advertised.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15317.645s">Eddie,</a> you're saying you have the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15320.006s">You're</a> saying you're putting this in a classification program, but just the case, just the headline are all these words. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15326.828s">The</a> headline we had, we don't even understand this.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15414.92s">But</a> we're talking about the classification, not this description, correct?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15424.445s">Can</a> this be added or subtracted to it? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15426.805s">We're</a> going to vote for the classification, but can recommendations be added or subtracted to this?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15462.143s">Roll</a> call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15463.023s">For</a> the classification. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15464.404s">Marks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15465.045s">For</a> this to be classified in the city's compensation plan.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15473.47s">We</a> don't have anything.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15482.437s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15848.802s">Question,</a> Mark.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15850.083s">Quick</a> question. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15851.924s">Are</a> we as a city advocating that we want these things, or can somebody just come in here and set themselves up?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16084.047s">This</a> is almost like a preemptive strike for what we were talking about earlier with the folks about these massage parlors or whatever you want to call it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16090.751s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16091.171s">You</a> know, we're preparing for it, and I would hope <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16095.865s">When</a> you get this information, the same energy will go forward so that we can come up with an ordinance that basically we don't have to deal with folks in residential neighborhoods, unfortunately, that won't have the same luxury as something like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16109.134s">So</a> with that being said, I've got no problem having us go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16112.936s">But</a> my only other question is, you suggested that they could maybe come in under the term horticultural.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16136.506s">But</a> when you say the word cultivation, is that going to mean growing? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16139.188s">Yes,</a> it does. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16139.729s">Having</a> a hothouse and all of that? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16141.19s">Yes,</a> it does.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16255.207s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16255.648s">On</a> that particular motion, number one, we talk about local access. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16261.171s">It's</a> got some access alluded to. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16262.532s">You're</a> looking at a location that's centrally located. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16265.894s">Medford</a> high school is not centrally located. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16268.836s">And</a> from my most recent talking and understanding, I believe that the whole project is on hold right now because they don't have a, they don't have anyone that, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16276.997s">submitted</a> a bid that would be acceptable to the city.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16294.904s">Mr.</a> President, from the information that I've been able to ascertain, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16299.16s">It's</a> on hold, number one, for the time being, because I don't believe that they had more than one developer who made a request to go up there, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16306.503s">We're</a> not talking about the architect. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16308.764s">We're</a> talking about the tax-exempt non-profit that would be making the bid on the program.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16319.548s">Mr.</a> President, the tax-exempt non-profit, I believe that they only had one bidder at the present time, but that's not the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16325.65s">The</a> fact of the matter is simply this. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16327.351s">It's</a> not centrally located. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16328.821s">It's</a> not a place where somebody can go and take a bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16331.062s">It's</a> not a place where you would want to send an adult at nighttime to have them traverse up there and walk an extension part of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16340.028s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16340.709s">Number</a> two, the fact of the matter is, if it would be in a centrally located place, it would be easily accessible to not only students, but professional people. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16349.834s">And</a> those folks would want to be educated and have the high school become the satellite to the central location somewhere in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16356.979s">We've</a> talked about two locations possibly. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16359.235s">One</a> at Cheviro Auditorium, the other one, as Councilor Caraviello alluded to, at the public library. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16363.958s">A</a> great opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16365.259s">The</a> city is sitting on over $350,000 of that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16368.521s">But</a> the real fact of the matter is this, there is no public access operating right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16372.403s">Whether</a> you're a council running for office, whether you're running here for re-election, for whatever it might be, the mayor is intentionally stifling public access by not having it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16381.072s">And</a> at the present time, that is absolutely not fair because each and every rate payer on every single month in their bill, Verizon and Comcast, is being charged for public access for which they're not getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16391.657s">It's</a> going to take some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16393.098s">If</a> you read the report that the three-member commission that the mayor empowered in February this past year talked about it being centrally located, easily accessible for people to get to, and to be educationally and technologically available to students and for business people and for residents and for taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16409.416s">We</a> had six people come here on a particular night and talk about the value of what public access could be if, in fact, it was an operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16416.338s">But</a> it isn't an operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16417.838s">And</a> this administration, unfortunately, has not only fallen asleep on this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16422.62s">When</a> you had the public access here in June, the public meeting on the 10-year contract with Comcast, not one person from the city administration was here to talk about, never mind public access, but to defend the ratepayers of this community for being charged for something. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16436.123s">Where</a> do you have it? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16436.683s">Two</a> o'clock in the afternoon when people are working. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16439.187s">That's</a> not the time to have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16440.548s">That's</a> not being open and communicative. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16442.53s">And</a> what does the city hire? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16443.831s">They</a> hire an outside attorney, pay him $350 an hour to sit here and take notes for the 10, 12 people who came and spoke on that particular day. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16450.996s">I</a> spoke on that day because I think public access, and more importantly, our cable access bill is very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16456.861s">And</a> to have a 10-year contract go out with the lack of amount of public interest and input, that is wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16462.505s">That's</a> wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16463.405s">And</a> that's what public access is about, having somebody have the opportunity to come up, whether you agree or disagree, to express their opinions. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16469.907s">That's</a> what we don't have here in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16471.967s">Not</a> worried about what's going to go up in the high school, that's so far out into the future, way beyond an election coming forward, way beyond whether we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16480.009s">July</a> 3rd is right around the corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16482.23s">This</a> mayor has up until July 3rd to make his decision whether he's going to sign another 10-year contract with Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16488.954s">And</a> he was asked on that particular day, not only by myself, but other people, not to sign it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16493.796s">The</a> same way that the mayor is not going to hire a new director of public works until the new mayor comes in in January of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16499.699s">Well,</a> he should be doing the same thing as it relates to Comcast and to find out where we're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16504.542s">The</a> contracts now that are being extended go anywheres no more from three to five years max. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16509.864s">And</a> after the third year, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16511.155s">There's</a> supposed to be community input. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16512.315s">There's</a> supposed to be a community survey, for which never took place, as to what do you think about Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16517.456s">You</a> know, the aliquot and the specialty programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16520.137s">None</a> of that has taken place, for which if you read the contract, it was supposed to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16524.077s">And</a> if you read the guidelines from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Department of Public Utilities say those are the ingredients that are necessary in each and every one of contract renewals. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16532.779s">This</a> city did not follow any of the guidelines, none of the renewal quotes, and as it relates to that, and as a result, that's why we don't have public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16540.45s">Because</a> if this mayor was so interested in having public access, he could plaster himself all over it, like he does in Channel 15, and let everybody have an opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16549.575s">It's</a> not his station. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16551.135s">It's</a> not Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16552.556s">He</a> doesn't own it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16553.837s">And</a> that's what's wrong.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16572.24s">Mr.</a> President, the reason why, you know, lying is a strange word around here, because I think sometimes the maker of the commentary should review his comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16585.003s">The</a> reason why we wanted to get rid of Channel 3 was because it's despicable actions. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16591.287s">It's</a> a lack of accounting for money. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16593.449s">It's</a> a lack of keeping minutes of records. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16596.051s">It's</a> a lack of allowing people to come and speak, and it's a lack of doing the community work. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=16601.214s">And</a> for the people who were running it at the time, their complete abuse and misuse of their 501c3 prerogative, that's what is wrong.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_V22AEle-x6o/2025-03-21_V22AEle-x6o.html">Medford City Council - April 28, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2290.601s">Lauren,</a> you sent us a letter on April 24th, and in that letter on the second paragraph, you state as follows, for communities that are part of a regional housing consortium, the entitlement community must participate in a regional consolidation plan, which must describe and address the community development plans of all community development block grant entitlement communities that are members of the consortium. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2311.949s">So</a> my question to you is, are we a member of the consortium, number one? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2315.771s">And</a> number two, where are the monies, or are we giving monies to other communities that are in this consortium, unlike projects?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2398.069s">No,</a> not really. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2399.23s">Are</a> you saying that we are or we are not eligible?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2403.277s">So</a> since we are eligible, are we going to be taxed at any point in time from another community development plan because you're part of this consortium?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2414.403s">Are</a> we going to have to give up some monies that benefit the plan and another community?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2450.538s">Second</a> question is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2453.595s">This</a> idea of giving the housing authority $15,000, of all the people that have applied, they are sitting on hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenues. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2462.903s">Why</a> would you be doing that? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2464.004s">I</a> mean, I'm not worried about trying to develop a relationship with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2467.968s">They</a> never even got back to us after the feds went in there and did an in-depth investigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2472.431s">And</a> we were supposed to get a report back as to whether they were or were not adhering to the rules and regulations of not only federal practices, but also accounting practices. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2481.415s">for</a> which, again, we have yet to receive anything back. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2484.437s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2485.178s">But</a> why would you give money to someone who sits on hundreds and thousands of dollars of revenue that they receive both from federal and state when you have so many other small little agencies who are trying to work their butts off to offer services in a myriad of ways within this community? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2502.951s">I</a> can't buy that. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2504.192s">I'm</a> sorry.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2556.684s">Well,</a> maybe they should transfer the monies that they just approved for parks and recreation and for new courts in the same area and use it for the air conditioning and make that the priority.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2591.167s">Lauren,</a> you may say it's a small amount of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2593.609s">It's</a> $15,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2594.61s">That's</a> not a small amount when you're taking less than $1,000 away from other benefactors who are looking for the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2600.475s">Mr.</a> Clark. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2601.228s">I'm</a> going to move to eliminate the $15,000 from the house from this budget for the housing authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2606.67s">Also,</a> you, you talked about planning and administration for $286,000 in that $286,000 there is a comment that says whenever possible, the city will make every effort to attract discretionary and formula grant funds from federal and state sources to meet community development objectives. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2630.388s">Now,</a> if I understand that correctly, that's telling me that either A, you're going to hire somebody, or B, you're going to hire a consultant who has the ability to go out there and get additional monies, either through a grant or through some type of discretionary fund for me.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2650.682s">So</a> why the wording is in there is- Well, maybe the next mayor coming in will take a look at all of this and understand that a two-person office can't do this, and I understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2659.416s">But</a> I'm more concerned over if this is what the objective is to hire someone.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2674.044s">And</a> that's what's not in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2675.105s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2675.345s">That's</a> what's not described here as part of the 286.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2711.31s">Mr.</a> Clark, you who Mr. Clark, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2717.196s">Is</a> he paying attention or not? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2718.797s">Mr.</a> Clark, the council has a question, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2725.722s">If</a> you ran the meeting like you're supposed to, I'd like to put an addendum on there that we get a complete breakdown of the $286,754 for the purposes of any and all salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2738.367s">Well,</a> it's more than that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2741.328s">Any</a> consultant that has to- No, I'm talking about employee salaries in this building.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2752.253s">I</a> said any part of the $286,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2753.373s">That</a> goes towards salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2755.234s">That</a> goes towards salaries by name and by title.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2760.156s">And</a> the office of security development. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2761.256s">Do</a> you have that? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2764.678s">Who?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2767.219s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2768.093s">No,</a> I'm talking to him. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2771.554s">Mr.</a> Clerk, did you understand that?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2778.956s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3122.706s">I</a> just... They've never been refused money by the state, have they?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3126.926s">They've</a> gotten money each and every year for their state projects.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3290.032s">Why</a> are we spending money into a center that was already rehabbed before when you're leaving the 124 units still without air conditioning? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3300.92s">I</a> think they need to answer that question.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3328.213s">So</a> then maybe they are, if you looked at the minutes of their last meeting, you can look at the parks and the developments that they're doing on the outsides of pieces of the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3336.096s">If</a> I was a senior citizen and I was living there, and I haven't had air conditioning for all these years, and I all of a sudden <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3341.638s">your</a> air conditioning and community center that I don't sleep in at night time because I'm going to have to go and during the course, I'm not going to spend all day in the community center. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3349.986s">Maybe</a> they should be putting a program together to show how they're going to air condition those units that the people live in day in and day out. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3357.353s">They</a> give them heat in the winter time, we'll give them air conditioning in the summer.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3370.658s">Maybe</a> they should come before us, Lauren, before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3374.04s">I'm</a> going to stick to my issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3376.921s">If</a> you want to lay it on the table for a week, let the council go over it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3380.243s">No,</a> I mean, let the council go over it, subject to whether they get the money in on the issue.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3459.952s">That's</a> a point of further information, clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3462.853s">When</a> the dedication took place at the Fond du Carreau Center, the place was air conditioned at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3467.135s">So</a> what happened to the air condition from then until now? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3469.476s">Yeah,</a> I think the heat pump, is that what they call it, the heat pump? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3471.857s">I</a> have no idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3473.368s">But</a> they should have been better prepared when they made their presentation before the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3476.47s">Councilor</a> Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3477.511s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3637.074s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3638.315s">Warren,</a> you made the comment that we could vote to take it out and always put it back in. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3643.437s">Correct?</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3664.304s">And</a> I don't think it's a matter of waiting in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3666.125s">I</a> think your assistant there just got through saying that, you know, you're probably getting $50,000 more from the state this year.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3679.549s">See,</a> that's the whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3680.35s">When</a> they came before us that night at that meeting, they were so ill prepared. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3684.17s">to</a> talk about where they were going with the projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3686.732s">They</a> just wanted our money. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3687.873s">They</a> just wanted the community block grant money. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3690.115s">They're</a> sitting on hundreds of thousands of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3692.137s">They</a> have grant writers over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3693.558s">They</a> have specialists that could do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3695.639s">And</a> to take the money from other deserving projects here in the city, I think it's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3699.963s">That's</a> my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3700.664s">I</a> hear you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3742.487s">Laura,</a> let's go back and ask the question again. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3744.488s">If</a> in fact we go back to this $50,000 number at that point in time, could you pull this money?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3835.584s">All</a> we're doing is securing information, Paul. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3837.186s">We're</a> not asking you to take the money out. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3839.168s">All</a> she's going to do is report back if they're getting the money, and if they are getting the money, whatever the council so chooses.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3848.917s">Why</a> would you not want to get information?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3879.077s">That</a> becomes the whole issue, Paul. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3880.598s">So</a> let's give them as much money as we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3882.679s">That</a> becomes the whole issue, because all they're going to be doing is keep putting Band-Aids and Band-Aids and Band-Aids. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3886.8s">They</a> need a complete rehabilitation down there.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3940.782s">But</a> I think one of the issues, you're talking about the Green Line. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3943.843s">That's</a> not a definitive thing, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3945.403s">Number</a> two, that's not even looked upon by the president administration to spend another $150 million.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3954.407s">Talking</a> about the State House administration, that's where the money is going to be coming from if the Green Line extension is going to come forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3961.834s">So</a> you're going from the post office in South Medford all the way to Route 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3965.999s">That's</a> not a done deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3966.94s">Then</a> you have the area metropolitan area planning council.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3975.565s">The</a> Tufts University, Tufts University, Tufts University.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3979.447s">So</a> you take that. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3980.708s">I</a> believe there's also a report, Lauren, that came back from the metropolitan area planning council that has itself supposedly at the end of route 16 for 165 units of affordable and low income housing for which the public hearing on that particular night that took place in room 207, there were many, many residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3997.587s">from</a> the West Method area that were very upset about that because of the traffic, the congestion, the cars that would be parking there. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=4003.011s">So</a> there's a multitude of issues that are going on with this whole idea of the screen line extension. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=4007.374s">I'm</a> more concerned about your housing authority, the housing, not yours, the housing authority that has not come forward with any type of a game plan for that walkway court. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=4015.821s">And</a> all I see is patchwork, patchwork. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=4017.735s">patchwork</a> and I think it's totally unfair.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=5019.749s">A</a> quick question, John. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=5022.15s">You</a> had indicated some time back that the City of Lynn, I believe, fronts shows with money and the shows produce the money back.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=5031.997s">To</a> the community.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=5107.678s">So</a> how could you make your argument successful for the city administration to front the money up front to get repaid back? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=5115.622s">And</a> there might be some losses in the beginning, like you said, until it gets to the point that it's repaid.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=5191.342s">We're</a> not really losing. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=5192.183s">We</a> can win in the long run.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=5228.69s">You</a> know, real quick, you just mentioned the Stoneham theater and you know yourself, they were struggling in the beginning to get themselves going. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=5234.553s">And</a> it was the type of shows that they brought in that's basically saved them. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=5238.215s">And</a> now they're, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=5239.258s">They're</a> for profit.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7298.489s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7299.599s">Mr.</a> President, this is a very important position. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7301.76s">As</a> we all know, this will be the first time in so many, many years that this office is going to be vacated by the incumbent mayor, Michael McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7311.507s">As</a> I said before, I wish him well for whatever endeavor he so chooses. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7315.509s">And</a> I would hope that he would be finishing out his term and not leaving ahead of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7320.172s">But</a> be that as it may, that's not the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7323.334s">Right</a> now, the second highest position in this building, which is the Director of Budget and Personnel, has made an announcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7329.895s">that</a> that individual is going to run and seek the office of mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7333.336s">I</a> believe that was done some seven days, six days after the mayor made his announcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7338.597s">And</a> I believe that was on April 20th. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7341.658s">And</a> as a result of that, a further announcement has been forthcoming as it relates to that individual now going to relinquish that position on May 15th. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7354.881s">And</a> today, I believe we received another press release, which was dated April 21st. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7359.912s">as</a> it relates to the fact that the Director of Budget and Personnel is going to be leaving effective May 15th, even though the announcement was made on April 20th. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7370.797s">In</a> the second comment of the letter that states, I would not want the Office of Mayor to encounter any appearance of any conflict of interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7377.921s">And</a> I think there is a, a, a miss there. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7379.722s">It's</a> not the Office of Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7380.982s">I</a> think it would be the Office of the Budget Director because unfortunately, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7385.373s">This</a> individual is the one that presents the budget to the city council and goes through all the finances to make the city's council's budget come forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7393.776s">At</a> the same time, it's also the person that's in charge of personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7399.097s">There's</a> only been one person that I've been able to find in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the person comes from the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7406.3s">And</a> when this person, many, many years ago, made his announcement that he was running for attorney general, he resigned his position as vice chairman <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7415.098s">of</a> the Ways and Means Committee of the State House, that was George L. Sacco, former representative George Sacco. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7421.241s">And</a> that always stuck out in my mind when somebody running for jobs of such high authority, if you're going to be that committed to it, they relinquish their position, at-present position. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7431.946s">In</a> that time, vice chairman of Ways and Means was a very important position. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7436.269s">But</a> when he resigned that position, that was the day he made his announcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7439.85s">And</a> I would personally believe, and I would think, and I would hope, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7443.782s">that</a> a budget director would reconsider her position and resign immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7449.446s">To</a> have the luxury of reviewing a budget right now ahead of time or getting prepared for it, and I believe that the new person taking the budget director's place is now the procurement officer, and she will be assuming the budget director's position effective three days after May 15th, I think the conflict of interest is sort of like outstanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7470.02s">That's</a> an undue advantage ahead of time of any other candidate that might be running <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7473.938s">for</a> that position, and in all fairness to all parties concerned, I think May 15th doesn't serve any purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7479.903s">I</a> think it needs to be done immediately in all fairness, because if in fact, if in fact, that person were to become elected mayor of the community, and that person would be working with a mayor, I would strike that, would be working with a budget in advance that no one else would have had that advantage, advantage point two. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7496.175s">So</a> with that being said, with all due respect, I understand the position she's in. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7500.806s">I</a> understand that she's the budget director, and also the budget director in charge of personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7505.348s">And</a> if I'm looking at the second press release that was offered here today, it says that the procurement officer will only assume the position of a budget director, but not of personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7515.912s">So</a> I guess there'll be an addendum. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7518.433s">Someone</a> is going to pick up that position in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7521.274s">So</a> with that being said, I would like that position to be made loud and clear, and all fairness to all candidates, whoever they may be, he or she, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7529.632s">that</a> if the second highest position in this city has that authority for which that person has in here, I think in all fairness, they should be resigning immediately, not till May 15th, to get their ducks in order, just in case that person does, in fact, become the mayor of this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7548.142s">And</a> you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7549.043s">I've</a> spoken to members up in the State House, and they have basically said the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7555.066s">Judge</a> Sacco set the precedent. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7557.205s">of</a> resigning his position when he decided to run for Attorney General, because that's how committed he was. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7562.53s">He</a> was willing to give up that for which he had to go forward and campaign for that position of Attorney General. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7568.115s">And</a> that's what stuck out in my mind all these years. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7571.057s">And</a> then when I saw the situation taking place here right now, and reading today's press release, I just thought that that would probably be the fair way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7579.225s">And</a> fairness to the person herself, to just leave <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7584.337s">and</a> move forward because you've already committed to a date. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7586.539s">Why</a> did you commit on May 15th? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7588.0s">I</a> don't know if it's to get the budget in order and hands it down to the next president. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7593.344s">Again,</a> totally unfair and big advantage and a big conflict as far as I'm concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7599.469s">Councilor</a> Camuso.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7649.353s">Yes,</a> in response to Councilor Camuso, I didn't challenge her integrity and I didn't challenge her high caliber. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7655.538s">What</a> I'm saying is the potentiality of a conflict of interest existing. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7660.381s">I</a> have, I hear what you're saying and I don't disagree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7664.845s">But</a> I'm more concerned about the appearance of a conflict. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7668.088s">Second</a> highest position in this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7670.63s">That's</a> how I'm looking at it right now.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7858.052s">Councilor?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7859.994s">Mr.</a> President and anyone who might be watching, but more importantly, business people in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7864.945s">that</a> have to abide by the rules and regulations set forth by the council, the billing department, and the liquor commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7872.148s">I</a> observed something that's written in the local news food blog issue he made on March 16th, 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7879.291s">It</a> says snappy patties will get a whole lot bigger with the new patio. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7885.914s">And</a> then it goes on to say that snappy patties in West Method is going to expand with 50 more seats. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7893.202s">And</a> they're going to put an outside, upscale, contemporary American food of world influence, which they'll be putting outside for a service. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7903.385s">And</a> they're going to more than double their capacity with the addition of a 50-plus seat capacity, including an outside bar, according to the job postings for positions on Craigslist. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7916.209s">Now,</a> the unfortunate part about this, I think both for Councilor Caraviello and myself, on two separate occasions, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7922.919s">weeks</a> apart from each other, were informed that Snappy Patty's was serving alcohol, not beer and wine. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7929.503s">And</a> such reports were submitted to the Liquor Commission and for which on both times, the Liquor Commission had to tell the Snappy Patty people they couldn't do that because they wouldn't be in jeopardy of their liquor license. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7941.71s">Well,</a> after the first occasion, they should have been fined because they knew that they wouldn't, they shouldn't be doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7946.833s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7948.145s">I</a> believe last week at some point in time, they were out there in the backyard with the backhoe or whatever, digging up the backyard. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7956.669s">That</a> in and of itself prompted the building department to go down there and tell them that they had to stop, whether cease and desist, or they were going to be fined. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7966.094s">They</a> continuously are just being obstinate to the rules and regulations as to what's going on in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7973.357s">There</a> are many businesses here in this community <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7977.08s">that</a> abide by the liquor license laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7979.261s">As</a> a matter of fact, I think most recently during, I would say early December or thereabouts, there were, I think, eight restaurants in this community that the Liquor Commission went in to make sure that the folks were doing what they were supposed to be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7991.024s">And</a> I think two of them unfortunately got warnings because of the serving of the alcohol. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7996.105s">And</a> I believe in those situations, they were to minors. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7999.326s">But</a> this one here, they brazenly are serving hard alcohol beverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8005.034s">at</a> Snappy Patty's in total violation and total violation of the liquor laws here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8011.559s">Now,</a> if we all remember, we had a discussion most recently regarding Bertucci's wanting to expand and go with an outside dining capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8020.887s">And</a> by doing that, I believe they gave us a demonstration and they gave us a schematic of the tables that were going to be in the restaurant needing to be at least two to three feet apart to allow a wheelchair to get by and also <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8033.31s">to</a> have the accessibility of a handicapped bathroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8036.972s">I</a> strongly suggest that now Snappy Patty's has put themselves into a spotlight. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8041.774s">I</a> think their present location needs to be looked at as it relates to, is there room wide enough for a wheelchair to make an accessibility way in and out of their floor arrangement to a handicapped bathroom? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8054.94s">And</a> at the same time, this sole proposal for this expansion of 50 plus seats <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8061.171s">which</a> I think takes into question, is it even going to go on city property? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8065.213s">And</a> if it is going to go on city property, for which we all know we're still waiting for the results, for the report to come back on the contamination of that particular parking lot that's back there. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8076.279s">So</a> I'm going to ask, Madam President, that the building commissioner report, well, they gave us an initial report here tonight, that they put things down for which Snappy Patty's needs to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8087.785s">I</a> believe what they need to do is first, before they do anything, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8090.888s">They</a> have to commit construction documents to the building department. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8095.472s">They</a> haven't done that. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8096.653s">They</a> have to apply for a building permit, for which they haven't done. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8099.615s">They</a> have to send in a certified plot plan, for which they haven't done. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8102.938s">They</a> have to submit a floor plan showing the detailed description of the proposed work area, for which they haven't done. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8108.703s">And</a> they haven't applied before the council for an outside permit to have their business. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8113.547s">So</a> how does this business take it upon themselves to go forward, start construction, start digging up, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8120.289s">advertise</a> what they're going to do in total violation of the rules and regulations of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8125.95s">If</a> that's the case, Mr. President, and they continue to go forward, and they don't submit the appropriate paperwork and do what they're supposed to do, then I think the council needs to—and if I—Mr. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8134.112s">Clerk,</a> you can correct me if I'm wrong—do they have a common vigilance license from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8139.653s">They</a> do. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8140.313s">I</a> think the council should have a show cause hearing on their common vigilance license for a violation of how they're operating, and at the same time, the request would go to the Liquor Commission <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8150.275s">as</a> it relates to their violation of the liquor laws of the city of Medford, and it's quite obvious now, dated April 28th, that the building department is well aware of what they're doing and what needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8161.458s">You</a> know, this is absolutely unfair to every other single business person that's had to come into this community to go by the rules and regulations as outlined by the building department and by this council, if in fact they have to come before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8175.401s">But</a> to let this one particular business just do what they want to do <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8179.318s">advertise</a> what they want to do, don't have the right proper documentation, that's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8186.303s">So,</a> Madam President, I'm referring this both back to the building department, to our liquor commission, and to our council waiting for a report back as to what they're going to do resulting from the building commission sending them their notices that they're violating without proper authority.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8441.695s">I</a> forgot. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8442.075s">I</a> mean, and the Craig list announced, uh, it basically says, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8446.059s">They're</a> doubling their capacity with an addition of a 50 foot seating capacity, including an outside bar. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8452.48s">I</a> mean an outside bar. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8455.021s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8455.461s">So</a> put that all together. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8457.761s">And</a> how do you advertise like that on, on March?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8463.122s">March</a> 16th. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8463.803s">It</a> was on Craigslist in the food service blog.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8595.888s">When</a> you say you don't further, we don't know where the city property begins or where the city property ends. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8600.171s">And</a> I think the city's engineers got to get down there and figure out what belongs to us.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8889.511s">Madam</a> President, we all know, and I guess at the beginning, I thought it was to the great betterment of the school department that they got a $2 million increase on their side of the ledger. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8903.864s">for</a> the 2014-2015 budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8908.387s">But</a> after doing some initial investigation, it appears like those monies did not find their way into something that I'm going to revert back to Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8920.355s">When</a> you first came on, I believe it was at the end of your first term, you indicated there was $1.2 million worth of corrections that were needed in the Medford public school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8931.51s">And</a> I don't see any report coming back on that, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8935.652s">Number</a> two, the $1.2 million in corrections, having been talked upon, it's only been talked, if they've done something, it would be nice to get a report. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8946.596s">But</a> approximately 27 positions have been involved or impacted as a result of this $2 million increase, which I believe, if my numbers are correct, is approximately seven new positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8959.785s">And</a> these seven new positions have jobs that are in the $90,000 range, if not more. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8965.368s">And</a> I don't think that's what the people of this community are looking for when they see increases in the school department budget, when there is a lacking of teachers in certain specific classes, in the classroom looking for whether it be books or supplies or things of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8984.118s">Just</a> because you haven't had an assistant principal in some school for years, now all of a sudden <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8988.57s">because</a> you got the $2 million, you're going to go back and put an assistant principal in, which could be nothing more than maybe a political job, a favor to give to somebody. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8997.817s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8998.798s">But</a> I just think it's kind of like wrong that these 27 positions or thereabouts that have been impacted, of seven of which are probably brand new or thereabouts are brand new, with $90,000 salaries, if not more, represents the $2 million increase into the school department budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9014.17s">I</a> don't even know if the city can afford another $2 million this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9018.341s">to</a> sustain the $2 million from last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9021.424s">So,</a> what I'd be asking for, Mr. President, is — Mr. President, I'd be asking that the superintendent of the school department — oh, let me tell you another story. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9029.951s">I</a> went up to the high school the other day, and I walked into — walking into that high school in the front. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9035.416s">It's</a> a war zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9036.396s">It</a> looks like that school has gone through a war. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9039.939s">The</a> cement is all broken. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9041.621s">The</a> bricks are — <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9043.258s">The</a> bricks are just shuffled. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9044.999s">There's</a> loose pieces of concrete. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9046.701s">The</a> door's walking into the front entrance. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9049.483s">It's</a> an embarrassment, if you were a taxpayer to this community, to walk up to that school and say, this is my high school, and this is the high school where I want to send my children to. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9058.15s">I</a> don't understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9060.151s">I</a> just can't understand what they don't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9064.815s">The</a> young lady who came up here a little while ago, she talked about taking 5% of the budget for each building. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9070.343s">Well,</a> if we remember correctly, on the new school buildings, there was supposed to have been 5% on an annual basis until those buildings were paid off. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9078.146s">But</a> of course, the State Department of Education didn't have auditors to come in to check and see if 5% on an annual basis was being reinvested each and every year on those school buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9087.591s">And</a> now all of a sudden, whether it's a million two, could it be up to a million four? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9091.552s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9092.513s">Maybe</a> we should get a review of that also, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9095.934s">Just</a> what are the damages that need to be corrected in these buildings? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9100.266s">But</a> it's quite obvious that this $2 million has now become a political football in the school department wherewithal for the purposes of jobs and whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9111.976s">I</a> thought and I believed that the $2 million was going to be for educational purposes, teachers, books, supplies, things that are desperately needed, and maybe monies to be used to repair some of the buildings <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9127.505s">that</a> have been so delinquent for so long and not getting repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9131.767s">And</a> that's not happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9133.268s">So</a> I'd like to report back, you know, I don't know where the school committee is on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9137.83s">You</a> know, I think they have an obligation to explain this. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9140.671s">And</a> also, and also, and I don't know where we're going with this, but the scuttlebutt now is, and I'll wait one more week before I put this on the agenda, but the scuttlebutt is now, and it would be nice if we were told about this, that the high school is trying to merge the vocational school <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9156.655s">with</a> the high school and only leave three or four certain classes that are certified and make the other classes nothing more than electives. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9165.077s">The</a> Medford Vocational School has been a wonderful asset to the community of the city of Medford for students who just are not college bound. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9174.879s">There</a> are students that want to be plumbers, auto repair person, auto mechanics, workshop folks, whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9184.482s">whatever</a> the trades people are looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9189.205s">And</a> now for the school department to be talking and thinking of merging and only leaving three or four certified positions up there as it relates to these type of work entities and have the rest become nothing more than, you know, electives that kids in the high school can go back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9207.036s">It</a> defeats the whole purpose of a vocational school education. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9210.858s">So</a> I'm going to make this in three counts, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9215.177s">I</a> think maybe we should just meet with the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9217.859s">Maybe</a> we should have a joint meeting with the school committee for the purposes of investigating not only the $2 million, but discuss the $2 million, discuss the problems of the city, and discuss the makeup of that, and also to discuss just what are they trying to do with the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9235.372s">Merge</a> it? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9236.473s">End</a> it? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9238.115s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9239.144s">But</a> you have teachers that are very confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9240.685s">You</a> have students that are really upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9242.326s">You</a> have parents that are upset, because when they talk to me, I have no idea what they're talking about, because apparently this has been going on, and it hasn't been advertised, and nothing's been written about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9252.112s">So</a> this is a major change to our public school education, if the vocational school is now going to be transformed into some type of community school within the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9262.118s">That's</a> not what vocational education is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9265.2s">Absolutely</a> not. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9266.781s">So</a> I'm going to ask, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9268.459s">that</a> over and beyond having a joint meeting with the school committee, I'd like to have a report back as to A, number one, the $2 million that have been spent for this year's budget, names of individuals and salaries attached to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9283.266s">Two,</a> the repairs that Councilor Caraviello brought to the council, I think it was some three years ago of approximately $1.2 million that we get a list of all the repairs and the projected costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9296.353s">Three,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9298.458s">What</a> are they doing about this vocational school as it relates to changing the purpose that it presently operates under as to merging it with the high school? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9310.902s">Fourth,</a> why is the front entrance to Medford High School in such a terrible state of affairs? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9321.385s">And</a> lastly, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9322.682s">to</a> have a joint meeting with the school committee on all these matters.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9561.076s">Well,</a> all you have to do is look up at the ceiling over there and you wonder what's taken so long to get that fixed, whether it's the stairs in front of the police station, the stairs in front of the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9572.442s">This</a> is the whole idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9573.403s">How</a> would the priorities are set? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9574.903s">Just</a> reverting back to Councilor Longo-Curran when she talked about, you know, look at the lunch mothers who haven't received diddly in years for a pay raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9585.009s">And</a> they're there every day taking care of the kids in the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9588.443s">And</a> if I understand some of these bumps that the $2 million afforded, they gave people in management positions pay raises or they escalated their pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9599.277s">But</a> I don't understand how you can do that if you've already had a budget that was voted upon, which your salary is supposed to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9605.082s">And</a> I don't know if you can turn around and do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9607.144s">I</a> mean, that's what needs to be explained to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9609.466s">This</a> is kind of like crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9611.188s">If</a> you're getting paid $60,000, $70,000 a year, then how can you turn around and get another $6,000 or $7,000 or $8,000 out of this $2 million? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9618.955s">Whether</a> you're an administrator or rank and file, it doesn't cut the mustard. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9623.299s">This</a> $2 million was supposed to be for education. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9626.998s">not</a> for personal engrangement for certain people that work in that building. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9632.264s">It</a> should have been for teachers, classrooms, books, supplies, and maybe at the outset it should have been for repairs to the school buildings, because that's what's desperately needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9643.615s">You</a> spent $112 million for new buildings, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9646.783s">And</a> as of two and a half years ago, there were a million two in need of repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9650.426s">God</a> knows what the amount is right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9652.508s">But</a> they know how to feather their own nest, their own pocketbook with their own pay raises without acknowledging this. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9658.293s">I</a> think this is a very crucial matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9660.576s">You</a> have people on the school committee wanting to run for the city council and not acknowledging any of these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9666.961s">These</a> are the issues that are every day that are confronting the city and the taxpayers and the students that go to that school. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9673.83s">You</a> have whether they're the lunch mothers, who sometimes say they're the lowest ones on the rung because they don't get acknowledged, or you go all the way up to the superintendent, who gets the highest pay of anyone in the entirety. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9684.558s">Something's</a> got to be understood and explained, and not just at the budget time. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9688.821s">And</a> we have asked so many times ahead of time to have these joint meetings between the school department and the council and vice versa. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9695.246s">So</a> you have four separate issues here, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9697.888s">And</a> then you have a fifth issue to have a joint meeting <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9700.189s">with</a> the school department, so it would be great to get all these answers ahead of time so we could have our joint meeting, so we could have some sense of understanding to know where we're going, rather than walk into a meeting and just look at each other like a bunch of dopes. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9713.534s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9714.674s">Councilor</a> Langley-Curran?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9769.516s">Yeah,</a> on the point of information regarding the motion to sever, and Councilor Knight can do whatever he wants as it relates to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9774.978s">Fact</a> of the matter is this city council makes the final vote on the city and the school department budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9779.735s">And</a> this city council was informed that the school department was given a $2 million increase during our budget with absolutely no explanation as to what and how. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9787.54s">And</a> now that this has now been surfacing and people are asking questions and there are some concerns as it relates to how and why the $2 million was spent and now which precipitates all these other issues, whether it be the vocational school, whether they're merging, they're not merging, whether it's people getting raises, schools are getting raises. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9803.413s">whether</a> the entrance to the high school is gonna be, it is our bailiwick, it is our responsibility, and it's the school department's responsibility to talk about it and acknowledge it, and they haven't.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10204.353s">Let's</a> be clear about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10205.714s">When</a> we were presented a budget and we were told that the school department had an increase of $2 million, there was nothing presented in the budget as in the entire other part of the budget of the school department budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10216.599s">Each</a> department was broken down. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10218.403s">with</a> the names and the salaries of each and every individual. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10221.205s">So</a> this is on and after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10223.266s">So</a> this information that's being requested is nowhere to be found in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10227.228s">And</a> I think it's our, I think we're entitled to have it as we were getting everything prior to the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10234.613s">So</a> on that motion, all those in favor.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10321.946s">Yeah,</a> the front main entrance, the front entrance, you know, an update on this, an update as to, you know, how they intend to fix it, when. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10329.133s">and</a> how it's gone into such poor repair.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10484.553s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10486.575s">Yeah,</a> just reflecting back on what Councilor Lungo-Koehn alluded to on this Thursday coming up in the high school on the continuation of the drug issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10494.12s">Today</a> there was a forum that was held publicly outside here in front of the city hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10498.7s">at</a> three o'clock with some 50 plus individuals as it related to NACAM and the fact that they're still waiting from the police department and the fire department for coming forward and whether they're going to allow or whether they're going to use NACAM. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10513.924s">Um,</a> the unfortunate part is there's still no response back. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10518.225s">Supposedly</a> it's a union issue that they're waiting to negotiate. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10521.685s">Um,</a> you know, there's nine cities and towns around us that haven't, um, what the negotiation entails or includes, I don't know, but, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10529.008s">We</a> all know from the vigil that took place about a month and a month and a half ago, um, that we were led to believe that by the end of March, um, and this, uh, it was March or April, excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10538.556s">It</a> was going to be, um, set in motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10540.637s">Let's</a> put it this way.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10550.785s">Let</a> me finish. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10551.546s">The</a> gentleman from Armstrong ambulance indicated that they have administered it. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10555.867s">but</a> the surrounding, the nine surrounding cities and towns who have police and fire that likewise administered, sometimes they are there before the Armstrong ambulance, and sometimes they're in a position that no one else is in where they could possibly save someone's life. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10569.717s">So</a> what the detail and hanging up is, I don't know, but I think we need to get a report back from both the fire department and the police department on just where are we on allowing them to, or allowing them to have NACOM <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10584.732s">on</a> their persons, so to speak, on their property when they're on duty for the purposes of an overdose. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10591.775s">I</a> guess you can't use that. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10592.795s">Part</a> of the clarification.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11540.622s">We</a> also received a paper that was requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11544.384s">Um,</a> it goes back to, I think council Caraviello's original original request to summer 23rd asking for a report regarding the finances as to what they have taken in, um, for the period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11555.648s">So</a> for the month of January, February, March, they have taken in $223,964. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11562.86s">Um,</a> citations issued in January were 1,035 and February was 1,834. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11567.721s">And</a> in March it was 2,396 expired meters were 41% permitted zones was 19% snow bands is 13% and over time on the meters was 4%. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11584.326s">The</a> one thing that seems to be very telling here in their description notes, it says changes in the meter enforcement hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11591.3s">from</a> 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11592.04s">to</a> 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11593.241s">to</a> 8 to 6, significantly reduced meter and citation revenue potential. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11599.064s">And</a> unfortunately, that's okay as far as I'm concerned, because these bounty hunters need to leave this town anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11605.227s">Chris</a> Cappe. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11606.268s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Knight.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11618.12s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11619.26s">I</a> believe also, Mr. President, I believe also that, um, Chris Capri, um, who was a hairdresser in Medford square also has in her possession in excess of, I believe over 225 signatures, mostly all method people who come to her shop who are not only opposed to this, but it doesn't serve in the best interest because again, the signage is still yet to be posted, um, as it should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11646.94s">We</a> also know that the chief was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11650.182s">Unfortunately,</a> the mayor or his representative was not there. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11653.103s">Our</a> budget director, who was also a part of this, was in her office during this whole meeting and left the building after this meeting took place when, you know, she was one of the people that orchestrated this whole parking program. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11665.39s">And</a> this is the problem with this administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11668.011s">They</a> don't want to own up to the things that are taking place in this building that they were a part of. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11672.194s">Defend</a> it if you want, or not defend it. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11674.375s">But</a> the fact of the matter is, the purpose of this meeting <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11677.23s">was</a> to have an intelligent discussion, hopefully with the people within the administration that could either make the right decision or correct the decisions that need to be corrected. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11686.532s">The</a> unfortunate part to all of this, Mr. President, I don't know where we're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11690.052s">I</a> think the council has been pretty adamant, and they've acknowledged, you know, where they want to go as it relates to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11697.634s">And</a> the clue that doesn't seem to — they didn't tell you, and I believe it's — they have 600. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11706.524s">citations</a> that they had to negate because of the wrongness of the citations being issued. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11712.287s">Over</a> 600 — that's 200 a month, if you average it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11716.99s">That's</a> a phenomenal amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11719.071s">And</a> I believe, also, Mr. Nash acknowledged at the time when I asked him the question, they were supposed to have a job fair, and they didn't have no job fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11725.854s">They</a> were supposed to advertise over the Internet, and they didn't advertise over the Internet. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11729.136s">They</a> were supposed to publicly advertise, and they did. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11731.037s">The</a> only thing they did was advertise <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11732.708s">and</a> the local press. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11734.49s">So</a> that was amongst other major breaches to this contract that relates to Republican, the city of Medford, for which the council voted five to two, two weeks ago to have them time for them to leave the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11747.621s">And</a> I, and I, and I stick by that, Mr. President, it's time for them to leave the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11752.545s">They're</a> serving no purpose, but to cause aggravation and concern here, the bounty hunters coming in here, sucking off the taxpayers of this city, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11761.203s">to</a> make a 68 to 70% profit on the returns, leaving the city with a diddly amount of money.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11847.96s">Madam</a> President, Ruth Balzer is a State Representative from Newton. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11852.361s">And</a> she filed this bill after consulting with other local <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11856.944s">folks</a> and communities as it relates to local access. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11859.506s">The</a> bill requires that any monies received by municipalities for PEG access cable television be distributed to PEG access cable television. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11867.373s">That's</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11868.153s">If</a> a municipality fails to forward the funds, then it must provide an accounting, and the accounting has to go public. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11874.539s">The</a> bill requires cable TV providers to locate PEG channels in close proximity to broadcast channels. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11880.724s">It</a> requires cable TV providers to provide PEG channels with access <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11885.278s">high-definition</a> or other technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11887.079s">It</a> also requires cable TV providers to provide proper mapping of channels. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11892.802s">Now,</a> this seems to be kind of interesting, because last week, as you know, I introduced some information disclosed by a group of individuals, legally chartered, called Stop the Cap. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11907.97s">And</a> Stop the Cap is a group of people throughout the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11910.931s">It's</a> a <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11912.623s">Broadband</a> Comcast, it's a broadband watchdog group promoting better broadband, it fights data caps, usage-based billing, and other internet overcharging schemes. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11922.666s">That</a> for which Comcast is presently doing here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11926.427s">As</a> a matter of fact, Comcast, if you read it now in the Better Business Bureau, is now being regarded as one of the worst corporations in this country for the purposes of public service and for its charges. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11937.851s">Two</a> weeks ago, I believe, we introduced before the council <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11941.094s">our</a> State's Attorney General going after the community of Lynn for their misappropriation of money, lack of keeping proper records and minutes, and a host of other issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11951.62s">Most</a> recently, as of April 26, the city of Lynn now has asked for a receiver to go in and take over the channel the public access chase in following months of turmoil and alleged financial breaches that have triggered lawsuits and the arrest of the husband on the board <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11968.113s">and</a> a description of the use of the monies that have gone to people working there and the misuse of salaries coming out of the funding from the local access station. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11978.457s">Similar,</a> quite similar to that for which is taking place here in the city of Medford, for which the mayor has been not only dilatory, but he has failed. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11986.68s">He</a> has failed in recognizing that the sham of a filing of a dissolution <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11993.792s">by</a> the Channel 3 board back in, I think it was October or September of 2013, has never been completed, has never taken place. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12003.459s">And</a> as a result of that, what we have here is a combination of now coming up next Thursday, an ascertainment hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12011.766s">Two</a> weeks ago, last week, this council, I asked this council to vote to change, to make the, change the meeting from 2 in the afternoon to 6, 630 at night, because who the heck can go <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12021.585s">at</a> 2 o'clock in the afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12023.246s">The</a> mayor re-advertises the hearing for next Thursday to be held at 2 o'clock in the afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12028.208s">So</a> nothing has been accomplished as it comes to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12030.85s">But</a> the fact of the matter is, in Somerset, in another locality, like I said, in Belmont, in Somerset, having these ascertainment hearings, these ascertainment hearings are done in advance, well in advance, before the renewal of a contract takes place with the cable provider. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12047.697s">We</a> are operating here in the city of Medford with no contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12050.699s">We</a> have no contract right now because the contract time has come and ended as of April 20th. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12055.822s">And</a> with that being ended yet, we're having an ascertainment hearing well after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12059.885s">So</a> Comcast is nothing more than a tenant at will, so to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12063.507s">The</a> unfortunate part about all of this is when we were led to believe that for whether we agreed or disagreed, public access was going to find its new home up at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12072.713s">Come</a> to find out that the new home at the high school, for whatever it might be worth, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12076.553s">everything</a> has now been put on hold. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12078.653s">So</a> the monies that allegedly are sitting in the coffers at City Hall in excess of $300,000 that ratepayers have paid to access is now not going to be used for a facility up at the high school, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12091.096s">Number</a> two, the mayor is now not going forward with the public access station for the purposes of saying, you know, we're going to have public access here in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12101.458s">This</a> would make two elections in a row that this mayor <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12104.218s">has</a> intentionally denied the taxpayers of this community and people who might be running for office the ability to be on public access and to tell your story for whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12115.022s">And</a> it's also denying taxpayers and rate payers in this community the use of public access for educational and social purposes, because that's what public access is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12124.126s">Now,</a> when Comcast went before, and I think it was this past week, Comcast was denied its merger with Time Warner by the Federal Trading Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12132.602s">because</a> they felt there was too much of a conglomerate, that they would have too much of a control taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12138.164s">But</a> the mayor was one of 52 mayors in this country that signed the letter supporting Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12145.387s">And</a> in the commentary in the Broadband News Journal, the mayor and the 51 other mayors were considered to be shills, shills for Comcast to have this go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12157.432s">And</a> they have a delineated description of what these mayors got as perks <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12162.167s">particular</a> parks. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12163.348s">From</a> the best of knowledge that we have right now, the mayor got on an annual basis $2,500 for his golf tournament, and he got an annual $10,000 a year for his lights and whatever he wants to do in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12174.735s">No</a> other ratepayer gets that privilege. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12176.836s">They</a> don't get these privileges when they buy their Comcast privilege, or their Comcast, you know, whatever you call it. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12187.013s">Internet</a> service or whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12190.859s">Why</a> should the mayor get this personal park for himself? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12193.524s">for</a> signing a 10-year contract, a 10-year contract, that now, if you go into it and reading about all the advances that are out there and all the technology that's waiting to be served, Apple started with it, Amazon is into it, and there's a whole host of other ones that are telling you, not only through streaming, but through the way that they can bring cable television into the communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12216.717s">We</a> don't need another 10-year contract getting ourselves locked in. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12220.019s">And</a> the fact of the matter is, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12221.855s">It's</a> the upstreaming of the rates that we're going to be saddled with for another 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12227.201s">It's</a> bad enough you got a 10-year contract that was renegotiated for the waste management. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12231.705s">You</a> got a 10-year contract that was negotiated for this stupid republic from Tennessee. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12236.288s">And</a> now we're looking at possibly another 10-year contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12239.009s">And</a> I would hope that this mayor does not sign this contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12242.23s">He</a> is going out of business. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12244.23s">He</a> is retiring. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12245.33s">He</a> is no longer the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12246.791s">The</a> same way he is holding off hiring a public works director and letting a new person come in, he should likewise do the same thing on this particular issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12255.975s">This</a> ascertainment hearing is nothing more than a dog and pony show. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12259.257s">It's</a> just a sham because the fact of the matter is there is no public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12263.739s">The</a> public access that was recommended by his three-member committee was to have a local front door place where people could actually see it, not to be putting it up in the wildernesses up at the high school where at nighttime when it's dark, you go into the back of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12278.827s">And</a> now God knows what's going on up at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12281.088s">Like</a> I said, I hope we get this answer back if there is some kind of <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12285.483s">Something</a> going on, that there's some kind of a merger between the high school and the vocational school, and this isn't even going to be a part of it, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12293.066s">But</a> the fact of the matter is that needs to be discussed, as we know, as a separate issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12296.888s">But</a> Representative Bowser, I would hope that she gets in touch with Representative Gobley, and Donato, and Christine Barber, and also Senator Jalen. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12313.52s">and</a> seek their support for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12315.481s">Public</a> access is on the throes of being challenged throughout the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12319.443s">There's</a> 1,800 locations throughout the country right now that Comcast and Verizon are challenging whether to accept them or not because they feel it's a cost demand upon them. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12331.41s">They're</a> not realizing what the value that public access has. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12334.872s">The</a> unfortunate part that we have a 5% charge here, this city has a 5% <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12341.585s">inclusion</a> in Comcast payments. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12344.366s">Three</a> percent goes to the city's general funds, one percent goes to public access, and the other one goes to the high school for educational, and the other one goes to the police department, which is the old Channel 16, which is now, I think it's what, Channel 22. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12359.629s">Maybe</a> the review needs to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12361.549s">Get</a> rid of the three percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12363.009s">Keep</a> your public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12364.53s">Give</a> a chance to have the rate payers have a reduction. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12367.357s">and</a> absolutely give no perks to any one individual that signs this contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12371.338s">I</a> don't see any one councilor over here getting a perk, getting a perk as the mayor has for his years of serving with Comcast and the perks that he gets maybe with waste management, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12384.542s">But</a> I know that there is a $5,000 inclusion in the waste management contract that the mayor has to use at his leisure at any part of the city for whatever he wants to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12395.068s">He's</a> only signing that contract because he's supposed to be looking out for the best interest of this community, not for the best interest of him or her or whoever it might be in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12404.31s">That's</a> what these contracts offer. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12406.09s">These</a> are the inducements that these big guys come in and offer for whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12410.891s">I</a> would hope next week, when we have the ascertainment hearing, folks do come. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12415.952s">Unfortunately,</a> it's going to be next Thursday, the 7th. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12418.772s">I</a> believe it's going to be 2 o'clock in the afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12421.112s">And</a> my recommendation is to make the issuing authority the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12425.166s">not</a> the chief executive, because the Medford City Council hears the pulse of the people, they can understand what's going on, and there is a rationale of reason that can take place without having the singular person, he or she, make that singular decision on behalf of 18,000 ratepayers between Comcast and Verizon.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12785.862s">On</a> the motion, the legislation, I think, is very succinct where it gets to the second page. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12790.565s">It</a> basically says, whereas residents across the Commonwealth wish to keep in touch with their local government by viewing their city council or selectmen meetings, school committee and other commission meetings, chamber events, high school sports, regional and statewide legislative affairs shows, groundbreaking ceremonies, retirement dinners, dance recitals, school plays, and much more. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12810.556s">And</a> whereas the culture and definition surrounding <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12814.1s">Cable</a> television is changing rapidly, and community media is only supported through the cable television franchise agreements. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12822.187s">That's</a> in essence what this is, whether it's amended up or down. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12827.491s">Wait</a> a minute, can you let me finish? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12829.533s">What,</a> are you in a rush to go home? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12831.355s">For</a> God's sakes, just slow down. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12834.437s">This</a> is part of the thing before we have our motion to table.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12839.299s">You</a> know, you guys are really a class act. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12842.881s">You</a> know, people want to talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12845.022s">Just</a> let us talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12846.103s">If</a> you don't want to vote, you don't have to vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12849.124s">Just</a> cool your jets, will you? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12851.785s">This</a> is what the legislation is about. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12853.566s">This</a> is just a scenario. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12858.008s">This</a> is the gut of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12859.369s">If</a> they want to amend it, if they don't want to amend it, add or subtract or go right ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12864.319s">There's</a> nine people already on, that's why I said, hopefully our local legislative body and our state senator will jump on board with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12872.181s">They</a> are the ones that have been talking about public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12874.862s">Here's</a> a perfect example for them to be part of it, and I respect Councilor Lengel's concern to lay it on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12881.043s">I</a> got no problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12882.423s">But,</a> you know, just listen it out, that's all. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12885.964s">Just</a> because it's late, that's what your job, that's what we're getting paid $25,000 a year to meet once a week for, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12894.16s">Just</a> be a little courteous to your colleagues, all right, Councilor Dello Russo? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12898.981s">And</a> to you, too, Councilor Knight.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12923.059s">We're</a> going to follow the rules or not, but it's been laid on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12927.162s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12927.422s">A</a> little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12928.763s">We</a> don't never get stopped. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12930.104s">I</a> don't understand this.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12938.471s">Yes,</a> I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12938.911s">There's</a> one correction that needs to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12945.276s">It's</a> on paper 15 three 95. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12947.258s">The</a> word kiosk should be plural wise. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12948.919s">It's</a> kiosk. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12950.152s">Should</a> be an S. You have it as singular. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12953.195s">Yeah,</a> pluralized.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12958.4s">No,</a> it's plural.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_6QfAtkhSJ7g/2025-03-21_6QfAtkhSJ7g.html">Medford City Council - April 21, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=138.486s">On</a> that motion, some years ago before council and I came on the council, this was an issue that was brought up at that point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=148.315s">And</a> I believe one of the concerns we had was that our building department were getting complaints from people who were renting out rooms, if not spaces, within the homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=161.843s">And</a> some of them went to college kids, some of them went to transients, and some of them were just for the purposes of, you know, raising some money. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=168.167s">I</a> believe then, at the time, when Councilor Burke was on the council, she had offered a resolution as it related to the fact of maybe <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=178.24s">going</a> forward in addressing this particular matter so as to make it a revenue-producing part of the real estate that the rental properties were on. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=188.403s">Now,</a> the comment that you made, Councilor Knight, is basically the same thing that came back then when the conversation took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=196.065s">I</a> believe there was a side mechanism that could be involved in that, and that would be through zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=202.747s">If</a> the zoning does not or does allow for it, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=207.113s">then</a> I believe it becomes an issue that you don't need the Department of Revenue to indicate whether it's legal or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=214.396s">We</a> were supposed to then at that point in time get an answer back. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=217.037s">I</a> don't know, we might even have something in our law department on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=220.899s">But</a> I'd like to amend your motion to go one step further to have a report back. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=225.781s">If</a> we were to do this, can we do this through our zoning ordinance change, make a change specifically in the zoning ordinances, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=234.502s">that</a> would either allow or disallow that type of a, of an issue to take place.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=246.39s">I</a> would like to amend counts and nights resolution to look into having a law department look into the legalese, so to speak, of whether to allow or whether we can allow or disallow depending on which way you want to use this mechanism. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=262.072s">to</a> be included within specific or particular zoning areas in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=267.074s">So</a> that way there, let's just say someone has a two-family house, or they want to rent out a room, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=273.576s">I</a> believe if you look at our zoning charts, it'll not be allowed, or it is allowed, or whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=279.037s">But</a> if it has to be included in there to make itself regulatory for the purposes of taxation, you can do that through zoning.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=370.004s">One</a> particular addendum to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=371.765s">One</a> of the concerns that were brought up at that point in time when this was discussed <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=375.779s">some</a> years back was if, in fact, you are renting out that room or a particular part of the house, the parking situation as it relates to cars and within the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=384.764s">And</a> I think that's something that, again, through the law department, I think that's one of the things you need to have addressed.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=636.148s">Mr.</a> President, members of the council, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=638.432s">and</a> also our citizen taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=641.253s">I</a> think the resolution goes a little bit deeper than the highlight that's basically saying there. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=645.755s">I</a> know tomorrow night we are supposedly having a meeting as it relates to the parking meter system here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=653.518s">And</a> we all know what's been going on as it relates to this mayor's parking program here in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=661.501s">Just</a> a couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=662.522s">The</a> meeting is going to take place at six o'clock tomorrow night. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=665.283s">Allegedly,</a> our chief of police, the mayor, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=668.374s">The</a> people from Republic, from Tennessee are going to be there, and hopefully any and all interested citizens who have a concern as it relates to what this is all about and how they've been impacted. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=681.437s">But</a> during this past week, and then once again, I don't know where we begin and where we end with all of this, because it's becoming a nonstop issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=690.658s">I'll</a> jump on to you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=693.499s">On</a> the issue with the meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=695.233s">They</a> still say 7 in the morning to 7 at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=697.975s">OK?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=698.535s">And</a> as a result of them saying 7 in the morning to 7 at night, the fact of the matter is, I still see people trying to put the money in the machine. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=706.74s">They</a> were supposed to correct it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=707.681s">That's</a> nothing more than simple terminology. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=710.643s">They</a> haven't changed the screens, and that's another issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=714.185s">Speaking</a> with the folks down in Riverside Avenue today, just today, because I unfortunately haven't been around for a while, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=722.467s">speaking</a> of the fact, the rudeness of the individuals, the rudeness of the individuals, and how they talk to the patrons utilizing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=730.23s">They</a> finally, from what I understand, just finally highlighted the back of the van that basically says, this truck makes frequent stoppings, and that's all to be included here in the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=742.654s">I</a> want to thank one of our citizen taxpayers, Michael O'Jerry, who comes up here almost every week <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=748.05s">And</a> he's been very insightful, and he's been very helpful to me, because in my discussions back and forth, we have labored over conversations as it relates to contents within the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=758.997s">But</a> the contract has very specific sections as it relates to performance duties and responsibilities that not only the city has, but more importantly, the operator has. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=769.484s">And</a> those duties and responsibilities do come within the first 90 days of the contract, or within the first year, depending on how you want to read this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=777.499s">and</a> take advantage of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=778.939s">But</a> we all know what took place yesterday, which is absolute disgrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=782.48s">These</a> people, these out-of-town bounty hunters from Tennessee, yesterday were tagging people all across the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=788.822s">City</a> Hall was closed yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=790.623s">There</a> was no rubbish picked up yesterday in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=793.363s">Nowhere</a> in government was there to be operating. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=796.844s">And</a> what do we have? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=797.584s">We</a> have out-of-town bounty hunters going around, tagging people and making their lives miserable here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=804.526s">I</a> think we all received, if not all of you, at least I received, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=807.816s">Three</a> of them, through the email today, would pitch us not only of the tickets, but of the tags, and the people saying, I'm not even going to appeal it, I'm going to pay it, but I am not going back to that place of business again, because it's just absolutely wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=820.582s">If</a> this is what we have denigrated our community to, I just think it's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=827.126s">It's</a> absolutely wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=828.847s">I</a> had made a resolution, I believe some four weeks ago, and then I had brought it up again at another time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=836.476s">And</a> then I was asked not to force the council or put the council in a position to take a vote until we have this meeting tomorrow night. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=844.661s">You</a> folks as Councilors, you can have this meeting all you want tomorrow night. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=848.043s">But</a> I am moving here right now, tonight, as a result of this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=851.965s">And</a> I believe you have my paper up there too, as it talks to under suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=856.708s">I</a> am sure you can introduce it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=859.59s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=859.93s">Put</a> it in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=860.991s">Yep.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=876.679s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=877.479s">And</a> this is what we're briefing upon it because right now the briefing upon this is very, very brief as far as I'm concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=885.005s">I</a> am not going to go any further with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=887.246s">And</a> before I go over to my colleague, Councilor Camuso, I just want to <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=893.882s">say</a> to Councilor Marks, I mean, it was his insight dating back some five years ago with the committee that he served on that basically said we should have nothing more than a traffic enforcement program. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=906.093s">Let's</a> start it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=907.194s">Let's</a> see where we're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=908.755s">When</a> my resolution came up, I think it was three weeks ago, and you asked to lay it on the table, which I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=913.92s">I</a> believe at that point in time, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=915.472s">It</a> was your druthers council's marks that said, you know, maybe we should, if we're going to get rid of it, maybe we should think about having a traffic enforcement program, set it small, keep it in house. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=925.054s">And</a> at that point in time, take it to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=927.875s">I</a> am, I want to, I'm going to move on my resolution as I had. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=931.716s">And</a> council Camuso, he can speak on it as well because we've discussed this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=935.977s">I</a> am going to move that the city of Medford drop out whatever the proper terminology might be to cease its operations with Republic. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=945.29s">because</a> of their multiple violations, for which I won't acknowledge here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=949.732s">I'll</a> put it in writing if the clerk wants it or if the city solicitor wants it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=952.953s">The</a> multiple sections of the contract that have been totally violated by the operator and for which the city and for which our own chief of police has publicly acknowledged that he has warned them, advised them what to do, what to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=965.738s">I</a> have brought in here week after week with pictures. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=967.539s">I</a> have brought in the fact that they haven't honored their contract for lettering of their trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=971.421s">They</a> haven't honored their contracts for the kiosk, for the Times, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=974.822s">the</a> collections of the money, and after yesterday, I think that was the ultimate straw. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=979.566s">So</a> I'm moving, Mr. President, that the council take official position to A, terminate its contract with Tennessee, and B, to support the resolution offered by Councilman Marks, which basically says that the city look at and investigate its own traffic enforcement program for the purposes of the parking, the signage, which is two hours, 30 minutes, whatever it might be, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1002.078s">at</a> least take that position and then begin to go forward.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1009.262s">No,</a> I said advising the Mayor to terminate the contract.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1375.397s">Councilor</a> Camuso, it wasn't the people I spoke to. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1377.818s">It</a> was the people working the streets, not the people at the office. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1380.319s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1380.999s">Number</a> two, I believe inclusive of that resolution that you have in there, there is also a request for my resolution for a roll call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1389.342s">And</a> that's the thing that was laid in the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1391.142s">Now</a> we have two of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1392.563s">So</a> if you get to the, if you look at the official minutes and if you look at the record on the resolution, there was a request <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1399.258s">The</a> one that just took off the table, Eddie. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1400.698s">The</a> one that came off the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1401.599s">The</a> one that came off the table had a request for a vote.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1830.196s">Mr.</a> President, I thank my colleagues for their comments, but once again, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1835.567s">One</a> of the issues that were brought up in this thing is the parking spaces in the permit parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1841.011s">And</a> on page two of the contract, one of the things that really, I think, have riled some of the neighborhood folks is, A, maintain and update permit database. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1849.096s">B,</a> redo, hold, revoke, and reinstate, reactivate permits. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1853.178s">C,</a> update all permit files. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1855.62s">D,</a> inquire into permit data. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1857.691s">and</a> E, billing and payment for permits. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1859.452s">And</a> all of those issues, those five issues, have been really bones of controversy with the parking program and the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1867.555s">I</a> mean, we have folks from South Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1869.675s">We</a> have people from Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1870.736s">We</a> have people on streets that have permit parking that are getting tickets, and they have the stickers right on their cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1877.058s">We</a> also have the fact that into the contract, it basically says that the city has its exclusive right within its initial time period, which I believe is the first three months, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1887.466s">for</a> the purposes of, hey, taking an investigation and looking at and reviewing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1891.528s">And</a> by looking and reviewing, we're not going anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1894.589s">The</a> fact of the matter is, Councilor Marks, you just hit something on the head that probably we should have brought up before, and that's this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1901.151s">People</a> said there are more spaces now available than there was before. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1905.813s">Where</a> those spaces that are available, go to the stores, go to the merchants in front of the stores where those spaces are, and ask them if those spaces are helping or hurting their business. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1915.788s">And</a> I think the answer is very pronouncedly, no, it's not helping their business at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1920.39s">You</a> know, this is, you know, on page four of the contract, in the event that the operator terminates the agreement or, quote, ceases to perform its obligations herein prior to the completion of the initial term, that's the beginning, that's it, they're out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1936.137s">And</a> I think with that being said, and I'm not going to rehash it, I'm moving to terminate it, thank Councilor Camuso for being part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=1943.502s">And</a> the resolution, I believe, speaks for itself, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2496.293s">Mr.</a> President, in regards to Councilor Knight's remark, I'd like to refer back to our city clerk, Ed Finn. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2502.357s">I</a> think it was last Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2503.858s">I</a> had called Mr. Finn up and I asked him for something that the council included in the resolution that we brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2509.341s">I</a> think we had asked for all the resolutions that had been sent to the traffic commission for the purposes of their action and those that have not been acted upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2517.306s">Did</a> that ring a bell, Mr. Finn? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2523.33s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2524.51s">And</a> the request was to have it for our packet this weekend so we could review it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2529.674s">The</a> chief responded back, said, it's not ready yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2532.596s">Then</a> the second letter went out and asked them if we could have it before or on tonight's meeting so we do not go to tomorrow's meeting ill-prepared. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2541.103s">And</a> that's just symptomatic of what you're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2543.805s">I</a> don't know what it takes for people to respond to resolutions and requests, but every part of this program is just not working. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2551.591s">It's</a> just a disaster from day one.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2743.405s">I,</a> Rick, we've had multiple conversations about the cars not being properly signage, the back of the cars not being properly signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2751.79s">the</a> kiosks themselves not having proper signage, people putting money in the meter after 6 o'clock at night up until this past week, OK? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2760.217s">These</a> are multiple issues that have been ongoing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2766.542s">Well,</a> that's their problem for not doing it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3446.894s">To</a> clarify the point that Councilor Longo just alluded to is, number one, I believe what we're referring to was Councilor Marks's suggestion, is that if, in fact, we were going to terminate or eliminate, correct me if I'm wrong, if you're going to terminate or eliminate <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3461.072s">the</a> Republic Company, then we should look into having our own in-house with signage and whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3468.256s">If</a> the confusion is taken away and we just stick to the resolution itself to eliminate and terminate the contract, the first one, the second one is offered by Councilor Camuso and myself because of the breach of the contract, I'd be willing to let everything else go. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3480.982s">Because</a> you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3482.202s">One</a> of the things the mayor said in his newspaper editorial is to <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3486.37s">One</a> of the reasons why he is no longer wanting to serve is because of his inability or his lack of getting along with this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3494.933s">He's</a> never sat down with this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3496.834s">He's</a> never discussed our concerns relative to these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3499.955s">He's</a> made the outrageous statement that he's never received one complaint about this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3506.057s">Well,</a> I mean, if he hasn't received one complaint, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3508.913s">Where's</a> everybody, blind in City Hall that they don't know what's going on? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3513.978s">Of</a> course, of course it's an issue that it's outstanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3517.161s">And</a> if he wants to leave office magnanimously, and he could stand up here and say, you know something, we all make mistakes, and I made a big mistake by bringing this company in, but I'm going to rectify it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3528.351s">I'm</a> going to listen to you, Council, or I'm going to pull the plug, and we're going to sit down. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3532.234s">Because</a> if he said something correctly, Councilman <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3534.553s">Didn't</a> he say that he's been working on this for five years? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3537.715s">He's</a> been working on this program for five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3540.656s">And</a> you people put a report together. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3542.517s">You</a> people put a report together in September of 2009. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3544.799s">This</a> is now 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3547.1s">What</a> did it take him five to six years to put together? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3553.183s">An</a> out-of-state bounty hunter country company to come in here and disrupt our community? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3559.45s">I'd</a> be willing to forego all the amendments to the resolution, stick to my original one, Councilor, Councilor Camuso, if you want to stick to yours, vote on both of those resolutions, and everything else will work itself out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3572.419s">Because</a> whether he's going to sit down with us or not, it's immaterial. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3576.342s">He</a> hasn't even called us up. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3577.843s">He</a> didn't even give us the courtesy that he wasn't even going to run anymore to bring his legislative body in, the council who approves his budget year in and year out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3589.147s">whether</a> we agree or disagree. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3591.368s">We've</a> had many good days. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3593.369s">We've</a> had, I think, more bad days as of late because of the lack of communication, the lack of conversation, the lack of the wherewithal to put eight heads together instead of one. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3603.754s">And</a> that's why we're in the problem that we're in right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3606.595s">And</a> I believe it was you, Councilor Camuso, who said right from the beginning, you would have favored meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3610.717s">And</a> I think if meters were in, people would have absolutely understood a meter, instead of this crazy, outlandish parking kiosk that you can't see at nighttime, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3618.402s">You've</a> confused every single senior citizen in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3621.142s">You've</a> had people falling down in the snow, having to get an emergency ambulance to go to a hospital, and everything else that's been associated with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3628.304s">So</a> if you're willing to do that, I am willing to forego all of my amendments there, stick to my resolution, Mr. Fenn, as it relates to terminating the contract, and then subsequent with Councilor Camusos, for the same reason, and move on the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3642.586s">And</a> let the chips fall where they may.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4323.028s">I'm</a> leaving my original motion on the indeterminate <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4325.842s">in</a> concert with Councilor Camuso's joint resolution with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4334.204s">For</a> the breach of the contract and to, what's my resolution, Mr. Clark? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4339.166s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4351.649s">We're</a> the one that asked to eliminate, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4355.468s">Wait,</a> that's the... No, it's right there.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4398.342s">15-307.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4398.402s">On</a> the tabled paper, take my resolution to terminate the contract, and then take Councilor Camuso and Councilor Penta's resolution for the breach of the contract.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4410.885s">I</a> made that as an offering if everybody's satisfied. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4413.325s">I'll</a> withdraw mine, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4427.806s">What's</a> the resolution that you have there of mine that was tabled?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4508.791s">That</a> can be the substitute language for that resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4512.574s">On</a> the motion of Councilor Penta,
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4551.397s">He</a> already has them.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4554.719s">That's</a> the resolution.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4899.948s">Wait</a> a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4901.249s">Does</a> the word terminate the contract in there? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4904.952s">Wait</a> a minute, where's the word terminate at? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4906.653s">Wait</a> a minute, where's the word? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4907.493s">Wait</a> a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4916.696s">To</a> remove the kiosk and terminate the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4920.337s">Put</a> that in the end edit.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4928.1s">Fourth</a> with. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4930.04s">Remove</a> the kiosk and terminate the contract fourth with. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4936.97s">That's</a> the key, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4937.911s">That's</a> the key. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4938.631s">That</a> was going to be a key paper or a separate motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4945.375s">Why</a> do you want it to be part of this?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4950.718s">You</a> have it, Eddie? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4951.198s">All</a> right, read it now.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4955.92s">And</a> to terminate the contract forthwith.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4960.323s">No,</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4961.283s">After</a> the word, read the last sentence.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5440.764s">Did</a> I hear you correctly? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5441.944s">Did</a> you said that you would want to edit what goes onto the city website rather than getting the actual true content?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5451.401s">What</a> did you say? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5452.762s">Maybe</a> I misunderstood.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6233.732s">I</a> want to thank counsel a night. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6234.973s">You</a> just lead me into my conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6237.575s">This</a> ascertainment hearing that is scheduled for next Wednesday at two o'clock in the afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6241.931s">makes</a> absolutely no sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6244.173s">Number</a> one, the contract that the city of Medford has with Comcast Cable has already now been terminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6250.237s">It</a> ended on April 20th. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6252.758s">April</a> 20th has now come and gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6255.24s">An</a> ascertainment hearing, if anybody follows it, is for the purposes of gating information that one would have within a community as it relates to a forthcoming renewal to a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6269.81s">For</a> example, in Belmont, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6271.797s">the</a> Board of Selectmen, who happened to be the issuing authority, and I would hope next Wednesday at that hearing, and I'm going to make the request tonight that the hearing take place at 6.30 at night rather than 2 o'clock in the afternoon, making it available for people. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6284.24s">But</a> the ascertainment hearing, which was offered by the Board of Selectmen, because they were the issuing authority, had a whole bunch of people who came forward that explained what they felt was needed in the community, for example, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6297.861s">Some</a> people complained that their reception was poor. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6301.082s">Other</a> people complained, was it possible to get channels without commercials? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6305.003s">Another</a> one complained, can senior citizens have a special break? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6310.905s">Movie</a> channels were also taken into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6313.966s">They</a> also talked about cable subscriptions and the lack of some cable subscriptions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6319.728s">Another</a> resident complained about the unavailability of people to respond to their phone calls instead of a voicemail message and requesting people to leave messages. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6328.112s">Another</a> resident complained about the lack of a food channel and the Fox channels. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6331.995s">And</a> another resident complained about continual increases in the cost for cable services. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6337.238s">And</a> another resident complained about... And we can go on and on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6340.5s">The</a> idea, if you're getting it, is the fact that people had an opportunity to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6344.443s">And</a> for the purposes of them having that opportunity to come, they would be able to explain what was wrong within the cable system within their community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6352.648s">Now,</a> hunting all of this down, in some of the contracts that Comcast has, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6357.808s">There</a> are provisos in the contract that says within a 15-year period of time that a contract takes place. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6365.893s">So</a> that would give you a span of either one or two contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6369.936s">A</a> public survey needs to be done or should be done by Comcast, in this particular case, because we're talking about Comcast, within the community for which they are securing their renewal to the license. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6382.764s">And</a> in that survey, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6385.416s">They</a> would be asking all kinds of questions as it relates to the needs within the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6390.68s">What</a> would you like to see? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6392.241s">What</a> do you think that Comcast could do better? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6394.583s">How</a> do you believe that they could be a better provider within the community? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6398.646s">And</a> with that being said, and I don't believe Medford has ever had it, and with that being said, Philadelphia is a perfect example. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6405.772s">The</a> city of Philadelphia did it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6407.093s">They</a> had a great response from the rate payers within that community, and they got a better reception as it relates to <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6414.863s">you</a> know, the services that Comcast was going to give them. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6419.646s">Also,</a> this merger taking place, the proposed merger to take place between Comcast and Time Warner is really a deadly issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6431.755s">There</a> is a group of a non-profit organization of individuals, it's called Stop the Cap, and these are a citizens-activated watchdog group. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6440.681s">They</a> promote better broadband, they fight data caps, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6444.413s">usage-based</a> billings, and other internet overcharging schemes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6448.414s">And</a> in this particular case, only 52 mayors, only 52 mayors throughout the entire United States of America signed off on this merger. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6458.797s">And</a> who do you think one of the two, one of the 52 mayors was? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6463.119s">It's</a> our mayor and the city of Medford, Mayor McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6466.239s">And</a> what he and the other 51 mayors did, they brought together and they signed a letter <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6472.137s">And</a> in this letter that they signed, that they sent to the FCC, they unfortunately made a big mistake. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6478.56s">Because</a> what they did is it was a terribly misleading letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6482.401s">Because</a> what they did is they took facts and figures from the Comcast proposal that was used as part of their press release. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6492.725s">And</a> the letter was signed, and the text was taken almost, quote, almost entirely from Comcast's own talking points, and the letter <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6502.079s">was</a> misleading in the parts because the facts were inaccurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6505.76s">Now,</a> one other thing a lot of people don't know about, that Comcast and Time Warner have what they call cross-marketing agreements with Verizon. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6515.343s">And</a> right now, the three of them do work together, and especially in the western part of our country, and California, and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6522.485s">And</a> the 52 mayors, which includes Mayor McGlynn, advocating for this multi-billion dollar cable merger is not good for the cable subscribers. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6530.273s">Because</a> if this merger succeeds, rates will increase, your delivery and your service will increase or decrease, depending on how you're viewed it, and you'll have no place to turn because you're going to be involved with what they call compulsory user allowance. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6549.24s">And</a> what compulsory user allowance means that whatever Comcast decides to make a decision on, and if this decision goes through with Time Warner, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6558.93s">and</a> Verizon, because they're all working together on this, rate changes and rate charges. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6563.433s">And</a> if they get into this term called compulsory usage allowance, that is going to precipitate the rates and the charges that people are going to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6574.999s">Now,</a> we here in the city of Medford have a very unfortunate circumstance. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6579.902s">We're</a> dealing with a contract that's already been signed. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6583.284s">And</a> if I understand the contract that's already been signed, that's presently existing, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6588.81s">not</a> its renewal, it's part of a three year lapse over from the original contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6594.713s">So</a> we're dealing with the contract that is 13 years old here within our city of Medford, 13 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6602.998s">And</a> what have the rate payers gotten out of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6605.96s">Personally,</a> they've gotten rate increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6610.242s">If</a> you notice on the second box and the second, third and fourth box of the rooms, they've now gone up from 199 to 299. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6615.466s">If</a> you look at the building, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6618.207s">They</a> secretly went up. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6619.867s">But</a> what's interesting here, there's only one person who's had a political gain out of all of this, and that's the mayor of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6626.869s">Because</a> each and every year, while this contract has been in effect, he has received $2,500 for his annual golf classic, for the mayor's golf classic. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6637.911s">Now,</a> does anybody in this council, in the school committee, is there any rate payer out there that gets $2,500 from your cable provider for your golf classic or for whatever you want to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6648.382s">And</a> if, according to the records under the Freedom of Information Act, disclosed, he also gets an additional $10,000 a year for his celebrations committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6657.187s">And</a> what he does with that money and how he celebrates, we don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6661.409s">But</a> isn't that interesting? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6662.79s">We</a> pay our cable rates, and this mayor gets $2,500 a year annually for his golf tournament, and he gets an additional $10,000 for his celebrations committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6672.935s">Now,</a> I ask every member of this council and anyone who might be watching at any rate <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6677.758s">Do</a> you have that luxury and do you have that privilege? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6680.88s">Because</a> the mayor of this community under the present contract is the issuing authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6685.803s">Why</a> should he be given that luxury? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6688.124s">And</a> more importantly, how bold and brazen can he be to let a contract be signed and then he now calls for an ascertainment hearing for next Wednesday at 2 o'clock in the afternoon in the dead of day when people are working <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6703.105s">Who</a> are going to be able to come here? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6705.166s">And</a> then what are you going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6706.507s">Have</a> the poor people come and park behind City Hall and not understand that there's a kiosk there, and you're going to give them a ticket for coming to an ascertainment hearing that relates to their cable bills? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6716.674s">I</a> don't think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6718.155s">So,</a> with all due respect, Mr. President, I just think it's — we have two big issues here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6724.72s">We</a> have one of 252 mayors throughout the entire country <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6730.016s">Only</a> 52 mayors signed off on this merger because maybe those 52 mayors, maybe those 52 mayors were getting special privileges like our mayor was. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6739.844s">I</a> don't think he or anyone else deserved to get a special privilege because he signs a contract in behalf of ratepayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6746.87s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6748.252s">And</a> on the other part, Mr. President, the ratepayers have no vantage point here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6753.376s">I</a> think we need to know what does Verizon, what is Verizon giving to the city of Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6758.838s">What</a> special perks, if any, does the mayor derive from Verizon toward any of A, his charities, or whatever his wants need to be? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6767.702s">Because</a> they're only enhancing his political background and his political career. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6772.585s">And</a> it is an interesting, because this year here, he normally gets this money midway through the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6778.667s">But</a> this year, I believe he got it early on, because he probably knew he was retiring or getting out of office. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6784.99s">And</a> he took that money as a use for his <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6788.728s">you</a> know, for his political wherewithal, wherever he wants to put it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6792.07s">I</a> think it's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6793.39s">I</a> think Mr. Peter Epstein, who's the attorney who represents the city of Medford for cable issues, whose failure to tell this council when asked if there's going to be a hearing, I don't even know if he's going to be here to do the ascertainment hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6808.558s">But</a> how do you ascertain something after the fact? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6813.6s">Can</a> you tell me that? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6815.101s">I</a> don't think you can answer that, because in your profession, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6817.298s">You</a> can never ascertain anything after the fact, because your clients are already, unfortunately, deceased. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6823.161s">But</a> these people, who are alive and well, don't have that ability. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6828.024s">They</a> don't have the ability to know why and how. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6832.266s">I</a> strongly suggest that anyone who wants to come to the meeting next week, and I hope this council votes that it takes place at 6 o'clock at night, not 2 o'clock in the afternoon, but they eliminate any special perks and privileges <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6846.45s">associated</a> to the issuing authority, whether it be the mayor, the city council, whoever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6853.612s">The</a> fact of the matter is, over $300,000 right now is still sitting in the city's coffers because there's been no public access, I believe, since September of 2013 because of the mayor's failure, and I say intentional failure, to do his job to make sure that the board of directors of Channel 3 <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6875.449s">performed</a> what they were supposed to perform in their motion of dissolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6881.394s">I</a> got to give Martha Healy, the new Attorney General, credit because she went right after the town of Lynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6886.458s">And</a> she put together an absolutely beautiful document going after them for failure of records, failure of minutes, inappropriate spending. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6897.292s">in</a> basically lying about their jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6899.853s">And</a> that's what took place here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6902.114s">And</a> Judge Jackson, who was paid almost $15,000, wrote that in her report, that if those guys and girls did not get their act together, they should be removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6910.158s">And</a> the mayor is yet, and he has never removed them. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6912.959s">He's</a> been afraid to confront them. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6915.06s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6918.241s">The</a> motion is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6919.002s">Relax.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6919.462s">Don't</a> get nervous. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6920.462s">The</a> motion is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6922.183s">The</a> next week's ascertainment hearing be changed from 2 o'clock in the afternoon <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6926.938s">to</a> 6 o'clock at night to give every single Medford taxpayer who was a rate payer to Comcast Cable an opportunity to speak.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7677.338s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7680.328s">Upon</a> reviewing our resolutions that we've had in the past, and I don't know, you know, where you go with this, I don't know who has a sense of priorities around here or not, but going back, I believe it's the first week in March, and this is now almost getting to the last week of April, those lights in Medford Square are still out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7700.461s">That</a> public safety issue still is looming, and I don't know what it is that this administration doesn't see about the issue of public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7710.67s">We</a> heard the chief of police say that the biggest sense of priority and security for a business person is to have a light in front of his. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7717.433s">There's</a> eight of them out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7718.514s">There's</a> eight of them out and all within the close proximity to each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7722.736s">And</a> it just doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7725.137s">Beside</a> not having any lights on the Route 16 parking lot, for which this is now the 16th time that we're talking about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7733.261s">You</a> know, I don't understand why the mayor was getting out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7736.663s">Maybe</a> I do understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7737.703s">He</a> doesn't want to deal with these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7739.348s">because</a> he maybe doesn't know how to handle them. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7741.029s">He</a> doesn't know how to tell people to go down there and change the street light in a matter of public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7746.972s">But</a> it's OK for us to talk about it and talk about it and talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7750.694s">As</a> you've acknowledged, Mr. Council President, when you were sitting on there, on the 13th time we talked about the lights on Route 16, and they're still not done. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7760.038s">So</a> I don't know what it's going to take. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7764.892s">And</a> I don't even know if a new administration can make these changes unless there's a completely new attitude where it's directly people-oriented, not me, myself-oriented, people-oriented, taxpayer-oriented. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7779.162s">You</a> know, we just spent—we increased our school—we increased our budget last year by over $2 million for the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7785.526s">And</a> what did they do? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7786.087s">They</a> went out there and hired administrators, more administrators. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7790.442s">You</a> know, you're looking for quality education, sound education. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7797.549s">You're</a> looking at the herculean issue of Common Core, where it's going here in Massachusetts, and how it's affecting families, and the whole educational process. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7807.039s">What</a> are we going to do this year when the budget comes in? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7809.221s">If</a> we don't have that $2 million extra, where's the cut going to be? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7814.226s">You</a> know? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7815.173s">So,</a> with that being said, Mr. President, you know, lights are a very important issue to me because they signify public safety, you know, at a minimum. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7824.996s">And,</a> you know, this is now going on two months for those eight lights to be out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7828.337s">And</a> maybe the mayor didn't pay the electric bill this month. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7830.958s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7832.038s">He</a> got his $2,500 ahead of time from Comcast, you know, for a golf tournament. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7837.86s">So,</a> I don't know when he's going to have that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7839.9s">You</a> know, I just don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7840.96s">I</a> don't know what goes through that guy's mind anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7843.042s">You</a> know, maybe you do because you talk to him because he doesn't, you know, didn't he make one of the comments, the reason why he's getting out because he can't get along with the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7851.067s">There's</a> no communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7852.328s">Well,</a> the reason why there's no communication, he doesn't want to talk to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7855.51s">I'd</a> be more than happy to talk to him anytime. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7857.752s">If</a> he came before this podium right now and indicated that I'm going to do that, I've been a little bit remiss. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7863.335s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7863.656s">Mr.</a> Mayor, if he acknowledged that he made a mistake with the kiosk, I would be perfectly happy with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7870.706s">If</a> he turned around and says, okay, I've been a little dilatory on having public access, but this is what we're going to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7875.849s">You're</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7876.469s">It's</a> a real need. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7877.649s">I</a> would be okay with that, but we don't have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7880.231s">We</a> don't have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7881.691s">What</a> are you thanking me for? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7882.652s">You</a> thanking me for my comments? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7883.932s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7884.913s">I</a> know they're good comments, and they're made on behalf of the taxpayers of this community.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_pkk5OxKuY6w/2025-03-21_pkk5OxKuY6w.html">Medford City Council - April 7, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=30.562s">Present.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=62.744s">Mr.</a> President, I move suspension of the fools to allow a citizen to speak as it relates to her concern.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=451.947s">You</a> made a comment that related to the fact that you have a handicap placard and you've been tagged three times?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=459.0s">And</a> you, did you relate that to the chief of police?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=526.12s">This</a> is, Mr. President, and anyone who might be listening, this is just symptomatic as to what's going on with Republic's attitude here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=533.426s">We</a> have a resolution further on into the agenda that will address some of these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=538.271s">But</a> attacking a person, so to speak, with a handicapped spot <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=543.782s">These</a> people, it's obvious that they're not trained properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=547.003s">They're</a> out-of-towners. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=548.243s">As</a> far as I'm concerned, they're bounty hunters. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=550.124s">They're</a> just coming in here to make as much money as they can at the expense of the taxpayers and small business. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=555.185s">So,</a> when we get to this conversation, Mr. President, as I asked you before, when we have our meeting in some two weeks, this is a serious issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=563.107s">Tagging</a> people, especially people that have a handicapped placard, that's just not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=567.187s">And</a> that shows a complete dereliction of somebody's duty to their job, knowing who they should tag and who they shouldn't tag. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=574.114s">So</a> I thank you for bringing that forward.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=851.77s">Just</a> real quick on Councilor Lungo-Koehn's comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=854.03s">I</a> have pictures here of just this past week and as late as yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=858.744s">with</a> these trucks driving around, driving around, unmarked, in particular locations within the city, on the ring road, and designated spots where they're not supposed to be, giving out tickets at 7.38 a.m., which is supposed to not start until 8 o'clock in the morning, and we can continue on and on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=879.721s">This</a> is in complete violation of the contract on page four of the contract that they have with the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=887.257s">You</a> know, I know, Mr. President, you're having the meeting on the 23rd. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=890.559s">You</a> know, I don't know how much can be resolved by then. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=892.96s">But</a> it's quite obvious. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=893.761s">And</a> I'll just end it by saying this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=895.182s">You</a> know, they had the contract signed on October 10th of 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=899.424s">And</a> they had the luxury from October 10th, 2014, to January 15th, when it was supposed to be implemented, and strike that first day of implementation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=907.009s">And</a> on February 3rd, it was Councilor Caraviello's resolution offered before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=911.511s">Because</a> at that point in time, from January 15th to February 2nd, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=914.898s">The</a> screens were so light and hard to read. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=917.619s">The</a> resolution was put on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=919.039s">And</a> as we speak today on April 7th, they're still the same way, hard to read, almost illegible, especially if the sun is out. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=926.441s">And</a> we can go through a whole litany of other things beside that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=929.022s">So</a> it's just obvious. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=930.022s">And</a> their public relations, it just doesn't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=932.703s">And</a> maybe they had no human resource background on teaching the folks that are going to work here in this city how to handle the people, talk to the people, whether it's permit parking, whether it's just giving people out tickets and what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=945.253s">I</a> think this has been a complete disaster, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=948.334s">This</a> is Mayor McGlynn's program. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=950.095s">He</a> owns it lock, stock, and barrel. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=952.156s">And</a> if anyone has a concern, as you continue to have concerns, please call his office and tell him that you're dissatisfied and you want resolution to these problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=960.098s">Because</a> I think the council is speaking up each and every week on behalf of the taxpayers, but the mayor is the one and the only one that can resolve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=966.661s">He</a> signed the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=968.041s">This</a> is his ballgame. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=969.442s">Thank</a> you, councilor.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1358.197s">Lachey</a> Senescar, number 5.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1782.544s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1997.252s">Alan,</a> you indicated that you've done a host of issues as it relates to hopefully remediating the noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2009.032s">at</a> that particular point. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2011.514s">My</a> question to you is this, as I'm talking, I'm looking for your email. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2016.557s">I</a> believe that you sent to one of the residents as it relates to noise being loud enough or disturbing enough that you folks would be offering space in your hospital for her to run her business. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2034.878s">What's</a> the difference between that time till now if the noise issue is still the same?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2210.897s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2212.298s">Mr.</a> President, through you to the chair, I have a letter here dated September 6, 2013, for which you addressed to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2221.682s">And</a> in that letter, you addressed two particular issues, one regarding the positive effects if, in fact, the Lawrence Memorial Hospital does go in effect into a merger. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2229.706s">And</a> then you have an unending paragraph. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2231.467s">It</a> says, on a second matter, which is about the noise emitted into the neighborhood from the Lawrence Memorial Hospital, we have contracted with a firm to install covers over the air intakes at LMH. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2242.212s">The</a> installation is scheduled for next Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2244.213s">It</a> should reduce the sound a great deal, and we hope it will provide relief to the neighbors needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2251.067s">So</a> there is an acknowledgment dating back to 2013 that the hospital acknowledges that there's an issue of noise in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2259.433s">Now,</a> if the state is coming in or the city is coming in, and maybe they're not there on a 24-hour basis, they may be just coming in there and putting up one of those ear monitor machines and seeing if they hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2272.681s">I</a> personally was in the hospital in a doctor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2276.235s">that</a> faces the Lawrence Road side. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2279.998s">And</a> I could hear it in the doctor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2282.22s">Was</a> it consistent? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2283.3s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2283.841s">But</a> it did run in intermittent periods of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2286.763s">Now,</a> I believe it was some two to three weeks ago, the resident, Mrs. Casey, appeared before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2292.327s">And</a> I believe, and I could be wrong because I know she's sitting there, she had what she had, what I believe, which is an independent contractor who would be willing to come in and service, I believe it was a $400 or $500 fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2306.352s">I</a> could be reading this wrong, but my impression was that I believe that she would accept and hopefully the hospital would accept whatever the findings might be that would make resolution to the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2316.938s">And</a> Mrs. Casey is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2319.619s">She</a> can speak for herself, but I think that's the way I understood it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2323.902s">And</a> that should not be at her cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2326.603s">It</a> should be at the hospital's cost because the track record exists that you folks at the hospital before you became CEO, and I wish you good luck. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2334.301s">Um,</a> but more importantly, you know, the neighborhood right now is an issue and it's, it'll always be an issue as long as that hospital is there.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2377.947s">The</a> only difference is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2379.687s">You</a> make a lot more money than we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2381.528s">That's</a> the difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2383.248s">So</a> you have to do a good job to stay in your position. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2386.669s">The</a> people can throw us out at any time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2389.029s">But</a> you're stuck there with a good salary.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2444.607s">Your</a> own e-mails acknowledge the fact that a noise problem did exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2448.249s">And</a> however they've been resolved, mitigated or whatever they might be, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2452.292s">But</a> can we have Mrs. Casey just answer that question? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2455.294s">I</a> think this will resolve the whole problem.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2458.576s">Sure.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2500.599s">Nobody's</a> saying that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2501.26s">I</a> just, just want this problem resolved and to go away. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2505.782s">So</a> could we just, can we have Mrs. Casey just answer that question?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2713.408s">Well,</a> I don't think it's that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2714.288s">I</a> think it's just getting to a final resolution and maybe this outside independent of both of you can bring <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2720.088s">resolution</a> to the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2721.289s">And</a> I think she would be willing to accept it as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2723.51s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3254.427s">Alan,</a> one of the things that came out of the report from the new Attorney General Maury Healy was not only the concern of maybe lack of competition, but I believe that there were 50 other medical <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3270.077s">senior</a> people, doctors in hospitals, who indicated that there was no belief that those prices were going to go down. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3276.879s">And</a> I think that was one of the major issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3279.66s">Another</a> concern, if I understood it correctly, is the fact that even if this merger is or were to have taken place, the guarantee that the Lawrence Memorial Hospital would become part of the Mass General or the Partners Group did not have a beginning date. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3296.525s">They</a> had that five-year window, so to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3300.48s">And</a> I think one of the concerns, because in my letter that I addressed to both attorney generals and to the judge, is that if this were to take place, I think that the licensure should become operative immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3314.527s">So</a> that way the city of Medford knows that the Lawrence Memorial Hospital is not in a holding patent, and we're not going to be just shuffled around. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3322.323s">so</a> to speak, because I'll speak for myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3324.924s">My</a> opinion is the Melrose-Wakefield right now seems to have gotten the bigger bite of the apple of what could possibly be had here for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3332.708s">So</a> I don't think the Lawrence Memorial is out of the ballgame at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3336.21s">I</a> think it's still in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3337.67s">But</a> I would strongly, and I would write it again, and I would repeat my letter to whoever the attorney or the judge might be, that the Medford licensure for the Lawrence Memorial Hospital has to become an immediate decision <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3352.127s">Uh,</a> not a decision breaker, an immediate decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3354.929s">So</a> the patients, the administration, the doctors, everybody knows that this hospital is alive and well, and it's not on a holding patent because that was the one thing that you did not read in the decision that was, that was rented by Martha Coakley. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3370.118s">That</a> licensure was not in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3372.319s">And</a> I know Maura Healy has a different, a different position on that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3453.884s">My</a> apologies, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3455.165s">Judge</a> Saunders, in her written opinion, was very specific as it related to the cost containment not being able to be proven by partners, and also, I believe, the competition that the cost containment <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3470.786s">could</a> not prove that it would be able to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3473.188s">I</a> think in the decision that was rendered by the Attorney General, the first one, Coakley, I believe there was a five or a six year gap in there or a window that they said that they wouldn't raise rates.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3490.88s">And</a> I think when Maura Healey, the new Attorney General, was looking for something that would be more of an establishment, that it would be well recognized and it could be amortized out. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3499.146s">And</a> I think that was one of the things that was <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3502.103s">That</a> was deficient in the report that Martha Coakley, the original Attorney General, who rendered her opinion on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3510.666s">But</a> the licensure issue is the key.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3519.689s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3520.809s">And</a> I think whatever your negotiations might be right now with partners, I think that should probably be premier right on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3527.432s">We'd</a> like to be a party of this, but we have to have an understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3532.088s">that</a> we have doctors that are well-respected in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3534.99s">You</a> know, we don't want them to leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3536.191s">We</a> certainly don't want the citizens of Medford to leave the Lawrence Memorial Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3540.013s">And</a> for whatever and however, it's going to be left as an established hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3543.535s">But</a> if we don't have our license or our licensure, however you want to term it, in hand, then we have to wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3549.999s">That's</a> just going to prompt these people to leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3551.781s">It's</a> going to prompt your nurses to say, hey, wait a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3554.582s">Where</a> am I going to go?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4313.768s">I</a> know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4314.609s">On</a> that issue with the bushes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4315.87s">There</a> was an agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4317.211s">No,</a> no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4317.871s">The</a> unfortunate part about that, the folks at the nursing home cut the bushes down by mistake. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4322.535s">I</a> understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4323.736s">Or</a> whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4324.777s">And</a> it was at the behest of the residents that forced the issue for which <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4329.788s">the</a> hospital, the nursing home, had to put the bushes back. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4332.509s">So</a> no fault of the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4334.069s">I</a> didn't say that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4337.63s">Well,</a> you indicated through a mutual agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4339.73s">There</a> was no mutual agreement.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4348.192s">But</a> you just said now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4349.313s">We</a> made our point of clarification.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4392.166s">Point</a> of information, Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4393.427s">I</a> believe it was this council that made a request that have either Maura Healy or someone from her office attend a city council meeting to explain that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4401.509s">And</a> I believe also a request to have someone from the hospital to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4405.33s">I</a> don't want to be that presumptuous to say to go ahead and support it because the new plan may not be advantageous to the Lawrence Memorial Hospital.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4579.409s">Uh,</a> and amendment, uh, request from Councilor Penta that the, uh, emotion also be amended to, to read that the, uh, Medford city council supports an immediate licensure approval for the Lawrence Memorial hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4591.159s">Uh,</a> how do we say it? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4593.321s">You</a> know what I'm trying to say rather than having it approved and you have five years to work within it, that the license is effective for the hospital immediately to become interactive with the, um, uh, partners. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4603.87s">Um,</a> what would the proper terminal? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4605.332s">Oh,</a> that, uh, that,
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4822.144s">The</a> chair recognizes Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4825.105s">Number</a> 2B, the lighting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4827.126s">Can</a> you explain where is this lighting going to be? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4830.708s">Please</a> state your name and address for the record, sir.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4867.19s">Just</a> on that issue right there, you're going to have that shooting off the building or are these going to be individual stanchions shooting down?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4898.842s">So</a> through the chair, if you're saying that you're going to shut the lights off at X amount of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4902.504s">No,</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4903.164s">We</a> didn't say we're going to shut the lights off. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4905.951s">Well,</a> I thought the whole idea was to give you the... Go ahead.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4919.394s">That's</a> inside the building, I'm talking about outside.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4922.955s">So</a> then how does that complete the purpose, as Councilor Marks alluded to in the beginning, of people just coming in there and wanting to hang around, because they're going to see the lights on outside.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5954.383s">Um,</a> I'm just a little bit perplexed on, on the motion to be honest with you, because we are now asking to get ourselves involved in a private institutions <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5967.835s">right</a> to do whatever they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5969.275s">And</a> the social justice part of it, for which I understand, is very compelling, not knowing whether the jobs are going to be here or the jobs are not going to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5979.178s">But</a> I've never seen the Medford City Council make the same argument for employees within this building, whether they're going to get laid off or not going to get laid off. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5990.141s">And</a> this is not within our purview. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5992.702s">If</a> you're looking for a vote that basically says it's not right, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5997.738s">I've</a> never seen Tufts University come down to this podium and tell us what to do and how to run our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6003.564s">It's</a> not their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6004.765s">It's</a> not our job to be telling them what to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6007.448s">Do</a> we feel bad about it? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6008.729s">Sure</a> we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6010.351s">But</a> I don't think this belongs within the realm of the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6014.695s">If</a> the council individually wants to take it upon themselves and write a letter, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6018.945s">to</a> the school and indicate to the school, to the new president, Barbara Rubell, the public relations lady, that we don't think this is right, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6028.529s">But</a> the fact of the matter is, they are a private institution. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6032.49s">They</a> don't come under any control of this Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6036.032s">And</a> for us to go out of our way to try to say, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6039.907s">You</a> know, I would hope that they would save whatever their jobs might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6044.628s">So</a> be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6045.108s">But</a> I don't see them coming down here and telling us how to run our government. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6050.37s">Mrs.</a> Beatrice just came up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6051.71s">I</a> don't see them coming down here and telling her how to invest those monies that she has a responsibility and the trust fund for. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6058.532s">I</a> don't see that happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6061.933s">I</a> just think we're going into a territory that's, you know, as far as I'm concerned, it's never been charted before. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6068.395s">I</a> just don't think that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6069.964s">It's</a> going to serve any purpose, other than the fact of Tufts University, they get a resolution from the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6076.988s">Well,</a> I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6077.589s">Is</a> it Somerville City Council? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6079.03s">Are</a> they doing the same thing? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6080.05s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6080.37s">April</a> 9th. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6083.432s">With</a> that being said, Mr. President, I just don't think we're going in the right direction on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6088.756s">And</a> while I feel bad, and I don't know whether the jobs are going to be cut or not, I mean, if they're having such a large expansion, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6096.404s">Common</a> sense would tell me if they're going to be expanding more of their footprint, why would they be laying off rather than not hiring more to take care of the buildings of their new footprint? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6105.448s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6106.708s">And</a> with that being said, I just can't support this right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6112.131s">I</a> don't think we have everything in front of us that we really need for the facts. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6116.492s">I</a> think it's emotional right now as it stands, and I can understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6120.354s">But</a> if you're spending all this kind of money for all this expansion, which is in the multi-millions of dollars, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6126.078s">Well,</a> I mean, why should they even be considered to be losing their jobs? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6129.1s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6129.921s">Maybe</a> we should have somebody from Tufts University come down here and explain it to us, and then maybe the vote will have more of a substance rather than the emotion that it's going to have right now at the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6140.57s">Mr.</a> President?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6954.263s">Mr.</a> President, I'm looking at the recommendation, and I will admit that it does have merit. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6959.725s">There's</a> a word in here that I didn't realize was in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6962.246s">I</a> was reading it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6963.047s">Maybe</a> I read it wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6965.192s">I</a> have no problem saying that Medford City Council respectfully recommends, because I think that has a different tone to it, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6972.794s">And</a> the word reassess is not telling them exactly to do it, but I think it's implied. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6977.275s">So</a> with that being said, and I agree with Councilor Marks, you know, I think this is, it's a good resolution, because again, like I said, I don't think we're out to hurt anybody, but the fact of the matter is, you know, we have to look at our own building, what goes on in this entire building here between and amongst ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6993.448s">We</a> have positions that are understaffed and we have positions maybe that are overstaffed, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6998.99s">But</a> as far as that goes, I would like to, after the word Medford City Council, put the word respectfully recommends. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7006.813s">Because</a> usually that's what a Medford City Council resolution does. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7009.334s">They</a> respectfully recommend.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7187.465s">Mr.</a> President, it's another wonderful Medford business person who, through the years, has helped so many individuals in this community make sure they got their tickets to enjoy sporting and community and family events, whether they be at the Boston Garden or other locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7203.978s">So</a> I just think it would be a nice way to say hello, give them a recommendation, and a happy birthday. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7209.122s">The</a> President Great guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7210.323s">And</a> thank you for that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8184.951s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8185.852s">Um,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8186.732s">Counsel</a> Lingo, because I, I, it does, it touches everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8189.594s">Uh,</a> this past Friday, a good friend of the family, 25 years old in New Hampshire doesn't make any difference where it comes from. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8196.617s">Died</a> of an overdose. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8198.298s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8199.118s">It's,</a> it's, it's, it's a sad situation, but I just like to travel back in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8203.881s">And</a> if you remember when we had this mini epidemic that was going on in the schools and the elementary grade, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8210.67s">with</a> the stamps. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8211.971s">Remember</a> when they were licking the stamps and there was drugs in the stamps and the kids got hooked on it? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8217.855s">I</a> think you may have been on the school committee at the time, Councilman LSD, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8222.398s">And</a> they were giving it to the kids for nothing back then to get them hooked on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8226.34s">And</a> that's just so such a, it was a sad state of affairs back then. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8231.063s">And</a> I think parents and the schools, everybody got involved with it and stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8236.118s">When</a> you talk about education, Councilor Lingo, I think every teacher, from kindergarten all the way up, needs to be educated on this particular subject matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8245.423s">It's</a> an educational course that's not English or history or social studies. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8249.805s">It's</a> an educational course of everyday life that's taking place in their classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8255.108s">And</a> the child, other than having their parents at home, it's the teacher in the classroom that probably has them more at a confined time and period <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8263.685s">than</a> any other time in their life as they're growing up. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8266.968s">And</a> the teachers need to recognize all the shortcomings. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8270.29s">Now,</a> the fact of the matter is, and I don't know, somebody out there mentioned the fact about, you know, the criminal aspect of it, and it's true. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8277.136s">There</a> needs to be, that component has to be attacked just as well because there has to be something that destroys the idea of having a seller give these drugs out or kids get themselves addicted to it and what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8292.158s">I</a> believe that there's a law out there right now that says if you have any kind of a drug or you sell it within 1,000 feet or is it 500 feet of a school, it's a mandatory two or three years, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8303.787s">You</a> know, there's been proponents for years going up on Beacon Hill saying that anyone who gets caught selling drugs to a student should have a mandatory five-year sentence. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8311.493s">Then</a> there was some as high as 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8313.894s">Whether</a> that's the issue to stop it or not, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8316.176s">But</a> the fact of the matter is that they're out there selling it, and there are more people using <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8320.785s">harrowing</a> now than ever before. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8322.325s">And</a> I think that day, it couldn't have been any more telling when that lady stood up there at that vigil and told us that she didn't lose one, but she lost two sons. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8330.267s">And</a> she lost a second son after he was four years clean. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8334.968s">This</a> is — it just doesn't go away. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8337.249s">And</a> it's something that a parent has to live with, day in and day out. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8341.41s">We're</a> all around this rail subject to — whether it's our own kids, our grandkids, or relatives within our family, or friends outside the family. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8348.792s">You</a> know, it's out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8350.56s">And</a> I think the police department, whether it's local, state, or federal, they have a big job in their hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8355.464s">And</a> what they need to do, and what the judges need to do, they need to step up to the plateau. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8359.887s">Instead</a> of giving them a slap on the wrist, or giving them suspended sentences, they need to send them away and do their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8366.333s">And</a> maybe they should build the jails in Wellesley, and Newton, and Lexington, and the high-priced towns where a lot of these people are doing the selling, and that's where they're coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8374.759s">It</a> affects every single body, and every single life, and every single community, rich, poor, and indifferent. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8379.915s">So</a> I thank you, Councilor Langel. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8381.476s">But</a> you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8382.057s">You</a> know what I'd like to have you do? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8383.358s">I'd</a> like to put an amendment on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8384.659s">I'd</a> like to have you have the superintendent of schools report back to this council, and I'd like to have you give him a time period that what he is doing within his school system with his teachers, so we all have an idea as to what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8398.55s">And</a> I think that puts the pressure on that, hey, if you're really serious about addressing this thing within our school system, because this council is serious about it, because we've all affected it, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8408.323s">We've</a> all been affected by a loss by someone, immediate or otherwise, then we're doing something about it, and we want to see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8415.788s">We</a> want to see it in the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8417.41s">We</a> want to see it in the budget of the school department, and we want to have it come and televised and publicized to every single taxpayer in this community what they should be on the lookout for, because the school department's going to do it, and the parents should be apprised of it as well.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8591.365s">And</a> as, strike that, have it amended that the superintendent respond back as <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8603.702s">to</a> what his plan is for each and every one of the teachers in the school system.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8620.795s">Yeah,</a> prevention.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8665.649s">On</a> that particular resolution, can we also have a copy of that resolution sent to the governor's opiate, I can't think of the exact title of his commission, because what they're looking for is input from cities and towns as it relates to their concerns as it relates to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8682.355s">I</a> don't know the exact <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8684.037s">name</a> of the commission, but he has a commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8689.338s">It's</a> the Opium Addition Tax Force, because if we could send a copy of that to them and keep them apprised.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8707.467s">No,</a> no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8707.907s">He's</a> just a co-chairman of a committee, but I don't know what he's doing.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8713.491s">No,</a> no, I'm not on that committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8714.571s">Are</a> you on that committee, Councilor Penter? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8715.612s">Not</a> on that committee, no.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8721.756s">Well,</a> when he gave that comment at the vigil, I think they said they were- Did he dispose of the matter already? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8726.298s">He</a> said he was working on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8727.399s">I</a> don't know what he's doing.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9243.72s">The</a> card and shelf, this is probably, I think, maybe the 14th time that this council has addressed this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9250.243s">And</a> I just don't know why the mayor just doesn't want to listen. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9253.004s">Four</a> months now, I mean, four weeks now into downtown Medford Square, and again, the lights are out. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9258.507s">And</a> you can go to all the squares, and it's epidemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9262.229s">You</a> know, National Grid, which has the lights for the city of Medford, used to have a gentleman at nighttime drive around the city, and he would identify all the lights that were out, and they would be repaired. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9271.618s">Now,</a> that stopped some time ago, and since that stopped, the city of Medford has done nothing to pick up the slack as it relates to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9278.0s">I</a> mean, you have to be blind not to realize, when you're driving through Medford Square right now, that there are eight lights out between CVS and going toward the banks and into the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9289.544s">You</a> know, public safety is a big thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9291.344s">If</a> you have to ask the chief of police, as I said today, what is your biggest public safety concern as it relates to breaking and entering? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9298.087s">And</a> he said, it's lighting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9299.826s">And</a> in downtown Medford, you go to Haines Square, you go to West Medford, you go to North Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9304.327s">These</a> lights are just out. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9305.387s">So</a> I don't know what it's going to take for the mayor to realize that he has a responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9310.528s">He's</a> got to come out of that corner office that he hides in all day long, and he doesn't want to see what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9316.909s">He</a> needs to see what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9318.15s">This</a> is a public safety issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9320.01s">It's</a> going on each and every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9321.51s">This</a> is four weeks running now that those lights are out. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9324.791s">And</a> there's no excuse to say that we don't have personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9327.712s">From</a> my understanding, they just got through hiring <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9329.674s">a</a> new gentleman that's going to be in charge of the electrical department, a former Metro resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9334.335s">So</a> with that being said, it isn't like they don't have anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9337.416s">They</a> don't have the personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9339.076s">And</a> if they need to stagger a person for one day a week at nighttime to drive around to identify the lights that are out and then go out and correct them during the day, then just do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9348.698s">National</a> Grid is not doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9351.099s">We</a> need to do it, again. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9353.057s">This</a> is leadership that is so broken and fallen apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9356.139s">I</a> have no idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9357.479s">I</a> have absolutely no idea what's going on and how this city runs on so many of these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9363.062s">But</a> this is a public safety issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9365.003s">You</a> can speak to the chief of police and every police officer will tell you the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9368.685s">Once</a> those lights go out and as the lights continue to go out, it does present a public safety to a public person walking, driving, and to the value and to the safety of the store. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9381.825s">that</a> these lights are supposedly on there to shine on and to protect people's business investments here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9389.708s">It's</a> bad enough you go down residential streets and some of the lights are out, but when they're in the downtown business working area and the lights are out, you have now multiplied that problem for an incident of crime to take place or an accident to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9403.714s">So</a> that being said, Madam President, I move that the Medford City Council on a roll call vote tell the mayor to <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9410.395s">get</a> these lights on immediately in the interest of public safety.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9861.755s">Real</a> quick, even though, and I appreciate the remarks as it relates to the Route 16, equally as important is the lighting in the downtown area, especially downtown Medford with these lights out. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9870.6s">So,</a> you know, these resolutions just don't go on the agenda lightly as all of us do, because, you know, we're believing we're doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9878.624s">But</a> if we can't get our responses, and that's why I said last week, we have a resolution on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9883.046s">I</a> hope the city clerk has upgraded his thing and he inserted the 10-day slot, because that'll really tell us where we're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9889.939s">on</a> a lot of these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9890.86s">We</a> still haven't gotten a response back from upstairs on the MS4, which is right around the corner, which is going to be a big cost to the city if, in fact, we have to follow the EPA guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9900.445s">We</a> haven't gotten anything regarding, you know, our street recovery program. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9903.287s">We</a> could just go on and on and on and a whole bunch of issues, but he's just not responding to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9907.69s">Maybe</a> because he feels that the council is not bothering him, he's not going to respond to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9912.533s">So</a> if that be the case, then maybe what we need to do after Mr. Finn puts that 10-day period in, we just put it on here and we override his veto. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9920.659s">And</a> then from there, it just becomes law. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9923.221s">If</a> I understand the way the rules go, if he doesn't respond within 10 days, it becomes operative. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9928.405s">Is</a> that correct, Mr. Finn? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9933.368s">If</a> he does not respond in 10 days, 10 business working days, the resolution asked becomes operative. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9941.146s">And</a> if he sends it back with a no, we take a two-thirds vote and override the veto. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9945.548s">And</a> if we override the veto, then we figure out what needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9949.11s">And</a> if he wants to challenge this charter as the charter is written, well, then let it begin now because this is really becoming totally unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9957.654s">These</a> resolutions aren't even for ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9960.215s">These</a> are for the taxpayers of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9962.136s">They</a> pay taxes for what we're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9966.429s">And</a> that man over there in the corner who wants to play King Solomon, he can't understand what's going on.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9979.013s">Roll</a> call vote, Madam President, and send it to the mayor.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10031.792s">Madam</a> President, once again today, as late as today, I have pictures here, right here on the infamous ring road. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10038.493s">Then</a> we have, I think it's Benton Street and South Metro, right down the street from you, Councilor Dello Russo, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10044.975s">And</a> then we also have, I had a 42-minute conversation with our chief of police tonight as he relates to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10051.096s">I</a> told him, chief, the resolution's on there, you know what it's saying, you know what it's all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10055.178s">I</a> have tickets here that people continuously keep giving me, telling me that they're collecting monies from the meters that they're not supposed to be collecting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10061.584s">If</a> you read the contract, the contract tells you how these vehicles are supposed to be addressed and highlighted. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10068.469s">I</a> know Councilor Dello Russo is calling for a meeting, I believe it's Wednesday the 22nd, I believe, or the 23rd, whatever it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10075.716s">And</a> we're going to have the people from Republic, the Chief of Police, and I believe it's the Traffic Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10083.68s">And</a> as the council has asked, Mr. Finn, we've asked prior to that meeting to have a list of all the resolutions that the traffic commission has and is voted upon and what's still outstanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10095.204s">And</a> one of the things that outstanding Councilor Marks is I asked the chief about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10098.785s">Um,</a> I believe that your resolution regarding the 15 minute, um, grace period, I believe today, I, a lady got out of her car in Medford square and she, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10109.612s">walked</a> to the kiosk, and while she walked to the kiosk, the guy from Republic, the bounty hunter from Republic came over, and he gave her a ticket, which is absolutely crazy, because think of this logically, anybody who's out there watching, you go to Bedford Square, you park, and if you're five or six car lengths removed from the kiosk, by the time you go to the kiosk and walk back, how are you supposed to do what you're supposed to do, and the guy is going out there giving these tickets, and today he's holding this handheld thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10137.764s">It's</a> not right, it doesn't make any sense, and it's absolutely not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10141.387s">But</a> the real good issue is going to come in two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10144.85s">Now</a> just think, what's going to happen here in two weeks? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10146.691s">Does</a> anybody know? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10148.632s">We're</a> going to have a carnival, aren't we? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10150.494s">And</a> the carnival is going to be taking up all the parking spaces here at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10155.057s">So</a> all these wonderful people who are going to bring their kids and think they're going to go to a carnival and not worry about the parking are going to go park in that parking lot over there with those stupid, stupid little <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10165.152s">kiosks</a> or against the building for which nobody can see at the end of the day, and the tickets are going to be galore. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10171.355s">And</a> then you're going to really see, you're really going to see the people getting upset about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10175.658s">And</a> the police department, because they're not going to want to handle it because it's not in their bailiwick, because that's what they agreed upon by a union vote, not to be involved, to get involved, but anything to do with the ticketing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10186.404s">And</a> unfortunately for this chief of police, for which this wonderful mayor has saddled him with the responsibility of resolving all these problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10194.461s">Well,</a> as I said before, and I said to the chief, unfortunately, this is not your job. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10198.803s">You</a> should be doing police work, not parking work. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10201.425s">The</a> parking work should be done by the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10203.546s">And</a> to have him indicate and say that he's never received a complaint, he's absolutely, I don't know what he's drinking or smoking, but he's on something, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10213.131s">We</a> heard a lady here come up here tonight and tell you from her beauty parlor that she not only wrote him, but she called him. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10220.705s">We</a> had last week, and I have the letter here, from Mystic Valley, the thing for pediatrics. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10229.127s">We</a> got the doctor, we got the employees, and we have people who are seniors who were there, gave the names of the individuals who didn't even know how to use, never mind the kiosk, but getting tagged. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10240.19s">People</a> who have handicapped placards getting tagged. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10246.301s">I</a> spoke to a lady that went to Here's Karen in West Medford during the second storm, the third storm, excuse me, an elderly woman whose daughter was driving her to Here's Karen. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10257.71s">She</a> gets getting out of the car and the Republic guy comes up to her, tells her to hurry up and move the car or you're going to get a ticket while the lady's walking into the store. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10266.277s">Now</a> that's not what you call good business. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10269.699s">And</a> then when you go in all the parking lots, the signs that say two hour parking is still up, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10274.749s">And</a> they're still giving out tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10276.41s">It's</a> supposed to be three-hour parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10279.091s">So</a> we're right back to where we went right from the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10282.692s">The</a> contract was signed October 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10285.193s">I</a> don't even think there's been any human relations interaction between any of these people that work for National Republic and the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10293.776s">I</a> mean, pardon me? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10296.615s">They're</a> ambassadors. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10297.375s">I</a> don't know what they're, yeah, you know, they're ambassadors for bounty hunters. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10300.876s">That's</a> what they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10301.597s">So</a> with that being said, Madam President, I just really think, and I know we're going to have a meeting on the, I think it's the 23rd, but the contract, the violations just keep continuing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10313.081s">The</a> pictures don't lie. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10314.721s">And</a> I think today, I think we all got, or at least I got an email from folks on Frederick Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10320.342s">who</a> have legitimate parking permits to be parked there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10324.626s">They</a> got tagged yesterday and today. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10326.588s">So</a> where does this begin and where does this begin and end? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10329.811s">It's</a> obvious the republic doesn't know their job or the people that are working for them don't know the territory of their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10336.198s">They're</a> giving out tickets indiscriminately. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10337.88s">Last</a> week, I believe the chief had to go up to Boston Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10340.669s">and</a> resolve tickets for business people up there who are legitimately parked in a 30-minute parking zone, in a loading zone, delivering, making a delivery, and emptying stuff out of their car. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10354.957s">And</a> the response from the Republic, if you don't like it, appeal it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10358.018s">Well,</a> that's not the way it's supposed to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10359.979s">They</a> should go and do their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10362.281s">Madam</a> President, I would hope when the Chief comes in two weeks, and the Traffic Commission comes in two weeks, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10368.625s">Mr.</a> Nash, and whoever he wants to come from in two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10372.227s">It's</a> obvious, all these things need to get resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10374.768s">But</a> Councilor Marks, you came up with a good idea, I think it was a couple of weeks ago, or maybe it was last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10379.691s">For</a> those people who have paid, let's find out how great this electronic system is that they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10386.314s">If</a> I paid before eight, and I paid after six, they should have a listing of all of that, because my number plate was supposed to be tied into that system. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10394.979s">And</a> if we all remember correctly, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10396.877s">And</a> I think I do, because the records will reflect. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10399.417s">I</a> think that they said that they keep the records in that machine either for six weeks, if not eight weeks, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10405.619s">And</a> if they keep them in there, pardon me? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10408.079s">No,</a> they don't purge them, they keep them for six, they have to keep them for the appeal period. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10411.28s">They</a> have to keep them for at least the appeal period. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10412.74s">So</a> I think it, yeah, the tickets, okay, in the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10415.38s">So</a> with that being said, I think there should be no reason not to find out, Councilor Marks, there should be no reason not to find out how many people <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10423.778s">and</a> how much money that they took. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10425.498s">That's</a> illegally, they illegally, that's, you know, that's a meat of robbery, if that's what you want to call it, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10431.359s">And</a> that's perpetrating a fraud. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10432.64s">And</a> you know who's getting rich out of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10434.8s">Not</a> only that, the mayor, he's making money on this because it goes to the end of the bottom line. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10439.341s">But</a> it's not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10440.701s">It's</a> bad enough you're taxing the people to death, and now you have this new McGlynn tax that's every single day. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10446.622s">Don't</a> take money that shouldn't be taken.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10879.025s">Real</a> quick, Rick, I'm going to go back to December 23rd of this past year. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10883.728s">Your</a> resolution, the mayor hasn't even acknowledged it, and you even gave him a grace period. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10887.15s">Your</a> resolution, as it relates to 14-795, basically says, and that we had 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, we had almost 11 people speak that night, amended by Councilor Caraviello, that a 60-day evaluation take place with the mayor and republic with the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10901.06s">And</a> we gave the grace period to begin when it became operative in January 15th, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10906.009s">This</a> is now April 7th. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10907.73s">Never</a> mind not having any meeting, we've got no financials. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10910.672s">So</a> this is what I would like to do in preparation for our meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10913.813s">Since</a> we haven't had our 60-day meeting, I would like to amend and have the council go on record that effective immediately that we meet with the council every 30 days for the purposes of going over its finances and all the complaints and the concerns that we have until this thing gets itself resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10931.923s">Because</a> we're going to be meeting with the traffic commission, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10935.118s">And</a> that's just going to be a one-shot deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10937.379s">And</a> if we can't get them to give us a response after 60 days, and if we follow what you're saying, Councilor Marks, and we now go 30 days after that, forget it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10945.224s">How</a> much more time do you want to give them to get their act together?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10951.748s">The</a> 23rd, Wednesday.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10961.174s">I</a> want to have this resolved before we did once again <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10963.803s">to</a> the concerns that were going to take place on the meeting of the 23rd.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10974.488s">Is</a> it the 23rd or the 22nd, Eddie?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10978.549s">22nd.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10988.133s">Just</a> before we do that, Madam President, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10990.155s">Again,</a> with all these pictures that are there, and the chief knows about it, he's aware about it, he's instructed Republic on more than one occasion to do it, and they haven't done it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10999.158s">And</a> once again, I'm just publicly saying to the chief and any police officer out there, you see these cars, tag them. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11004.139s">Tag</a> them and tow them. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11005.06s">Get</a> them off the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11006.0s">Because</a> you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11007.04s">If</a> a poor guy drives down the street and he doesn't have a sticker on his windshield because he wasn't inspected, that's a $50 fine, and he has the right to have his car impounded. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11014.782s">The</a> same thing without having a registration. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11016.965s">These</a> guys have been around since January. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11019.065s">And</a> from January till now, they still haven't gotten their act together, especially with their vehicles that they go out and they try to enforce the rules that they can't even have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11027.387s">They</a> try to enforce rules that they won't obey, but they want other people to obey. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11031.108s">It's</a> just not right, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11032.749s">That's</a> what happens when you go out of town and you get out-of-towners. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11035.849s">And</a> these people are bounty hunters, and they probably have quotas, and they're going to do everything they can now to make life miserable, to make up for what they lost during the storms.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11070.947s">It's</a> a violation of the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11074.008s">They've</a> done it since January.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11076.469s">But</a> my question is, the police aren't the enforcing authority on city contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11081.331s">The</a> Registry of Motor Vehicles has a site and section that says if you make frequent stops, you have to have that on the back of your vehicle that says <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11091.452s">This</a> vehicle makes frequent stops.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11093.313s">And</a> they have not done that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11094.733s">All</a> they have is those stupid flashing yellow lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11096.974s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11097.254s">That's</a> my question. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11097.954s">I</a> didn't know what was actually wrong with the vehicles, because I still haven't seen them, to be honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11102.575s">You're</a> not going to see them if you don't have them. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11104.096s">I</a> see the pictures every week. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11105.336s">That's</a> it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11114.178s">Aye.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11116.239s">Madam</a> President, can we allow suspension of the rules to allow a citizen to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11122.723s">Name</a> and address for the record.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11292.86s">One</a> of the things I think it's kind of like really enlightening to read is the action that's taking place against the city of Lynn where the prosecution really, the prosecutorial process has really gone in depth as it relates to the finances that took place in the city of Lynn that were just not being justified and accountable for. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11316.513s">And</a> we have been asking for a long period of time over here <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11320.748s">the</a> former people that worked for Channel 3 to submit their finances, and it started back at Mark Rumley, when they call it the Rumley Report, and then when we had Judge Thompson, and now we're here, and nothing's taking place, you know, and the mayor owes it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11338.685s">The</a> mayor owes it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11339.852s">to</a> every single TV subscriber. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11341.173s">He</a> owes it to this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11342.273s">We</a> keep talking about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11343.754s">He's</a> sitting on $300,000 of subscribers' monies with absolutely no accounting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11349.376s">And</a> this is what precipitated the lawsuit in Lynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11352.397s">And</a> this is how they're all getting sued individually for whatever it might be worth. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11356.358s">Lynn</a> is one of eight communities that, unfortunately, the public access channels just apparently ran amok because nobody was watching over them. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11365.802s">Just</a> like this city here, nobody watching over them. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11368.603s">And</a> when the voluntary dissolution supposedly took place, I think it was October of 2013 to now, and they said that they were going to submit all these papers, and the Attorney General blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and is just out there in limbo. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11382.071s">But</a> this new Attorney General, Mara Healy, she must mean action. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11386.592s">Well,</a> big difference for Martha Coakley, because this one here at least does something whether you like it or you don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11391.114s">She</a> gets back to you and she responds. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11393.815s">And</a> their in-depth action against the Lynne Cable television should be the groundwork already being done for the city of Medford just to copy the same thing and go after these culprits who just not has done what they're supposed to have done as it relates to, you know, providing the information, the minutes, the finances, you know, the equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11412.664s">It's</a> just, it's just outrageous. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11414.225s">And</a> for the mayor, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11415.738s">And</a> for the man not to have this public hearing, for which is required by just common sense, I mean, just for transparency, even if you don't want to even do anything but have it and let the people come and talk, what is he afraid of? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11430.567s">I</a> don't understand this man. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11432.309s">I</a> just don't understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11435.27s">He</a> doesn't like the council because he doesn't respond to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11438.292s">He</a> tolerates the school committee because he has to go every other Monday when he has to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11443.216s">He</a> never responds to our resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11446.08s">This</a> is not leadership that works anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11448.081s">It</a> might have worked in the beginning for him, but it's absolutely out of control. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11452.404s">It's</a> lazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11453.165s">It's</a> gone asleep. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11454.166s">It's</a> broken. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11455.266s">And</a> I think he's probably thinking about, you know, maybe these bounty hunters have a better job than him. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11460.71s">And</a> who knows, maybe he's going to go join a company like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11463.712s">I</a> have no idea, but this, this is absolutely not working.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11476.063s">do</a> you want to ask also in that FIOS contract the finances as it relates to it how much we get each quarter and you know how does that work into the whole program no no where are those monies that they come together with Comcast and FIOS you know we can find those resolve motion all those in favor all right all those opposed passes
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11589.949s">If</a> anyone knew Joe Conway, you'd realize he was a consummate person that you would want to be a representative of this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11597.391s">He</a> always smiled. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11598.571s">He</a> was never rude. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11599.831s">He</a> was polite. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11600.871s">He</a> knew his job. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11602.092s">He</a> was friendly. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11602.992s">And</a> at the same time, he did his job like he was supposed to. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11605.912s">And</a> if you needed a break, he would help you out, making sure that you did what you were supposed to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11610.627s">That's</a> what I remember about Joe. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11612.628s">Always</a> had a smile on his face and was always willing to talk and help out people. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=11617.109s">And</a> I think I wish I could say that for everybody in this building, but at least we can say that about Joe.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_zcjjYHT3OQw/2025-03-21_zcjjYHT3OQw.html">Medford City Council - March 24, 2015</a></h2>

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=954.547s">Big</a> Dave, whatever your name is. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=957.349s">Behind</a> Wendy's, isn't there an apartment complex being scheduled to be built there?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=964.514s">And</a> how many units? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=965.194s">Do</a> you have any idea how many units?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=967.883s">I</a> think one of the concerns before, just one council member just resurrected this in my head, on the lighting. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=974.826s">And</a> they wanted to make sure it was not going to be intrusive to the apartment buildings to the immediate left of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=980.108s">I</a> just don't know how the lighting is going to affect the apartments that are going to be behind you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=984.189s">And</a> can we get some kind of a lighting scheme as to what's going to go in there? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=988.571s">Because</a> if it's going to be intrusive to the new development in the back, I think we're going to have to address that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2025.239s">It</a> will not be lit?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2027.92s">So</a> this outside seating area will have no lights at all at any time during the day or night?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2038.822s">So</a> maybe, Councilor Mack, you can make a request that there be no lighting there after 11 o'clock at night? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2046.488s">No,</a> he said there is some along the side. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2050.771s">Nothing</a> near the patio at all.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3239.392s">No,</a> it's a public hearing because you're asking to waive one of the ingredients of the hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3243.073s">Can't</a> the Council...

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3639.172s">So</a> when we review this thing in six months, it's possible that you may not even be open until three, you may only be open until two or whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3645.117s">Correct.</a>

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3949.863s">She</a> makes something here, which I've never seen before. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3951.624s">It</a> says, do you have people who will seat them, or will they seat themselves? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3955.367s">And</a> do you have an accessible seating policy? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3957.568s">Is</a> that something new?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3969.434s">But</a> will the person seat these people in this area?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3975.757s">I've</a> just never seen that before.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4796.063s">Real</a> quick, I'd like to just insert one question, where you have five dollars, it should be for a citizen copy. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4804.948s">Okay,</a> so that way you're there because governmental agencies <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4808.194s">would</a> be entitled to it anyway.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5724.091s">Mr.</a> President, after I put this resolution on board, if anybody saw it, Apple, the Apple industry, Apple Computer Company, came out with their newest and latest of technologies for which they even allege it will be a challenge to Comcast customers. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5739.869s">as</a> it relates to not only their streaming, but also as it relates to the technology of being able to get that for which Comcast is offering its subscribers, as well as other internet providers. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5753.275s">Also,</a> Mr. President, unfortunately or fortunately, however you want to look at it, we got this letter dated December 18th that was delivered by UPS to this building over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5765.08s">Unfortunately,</a> it wasn't timestamped, so whoever had it and sat on it, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5769.637s">and</a> didn't relay it to the council as they should have, or to the city clerk's office as they should have, it just really presents a big issue because the 10 years is just about expiring, which is right around the corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5782.782s">There's</a> been no talk of having a public hearing, for which the mayor apparently is refusing to have because you're less than a month away, a little bit more than a month away to do this advertising. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5794.367s">Also,</a> there's an obligation, I believe under the contract, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5798.617s">Even</a> according to the folks from Xfinity, which is Mr. Kelly, and he writes in his letter of December 18th, that we didn't get until just last week, that the city has an obligation under the formal renewal process to either accept or deny Comcast's proposal within four months, or no later than April 18th. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5818.267s">And</a> this was hand-delivered by UPS on December 18th, and we received it last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5824.11s">Taking</a> that into consideration, and now seeing what's out there, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5828.314s">We</a> know what's happened with 10-year contracts here in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5831.736s">The</a> first one is the rubbish contract for 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5834.417s">The</a> latest one is the outrageous kiosks that are operating here in the city of Medford, causing all kinds of problems, not only to our residents, but also to the small business people in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5844.421s">And</a> now the mayor wants to saddle us again with another 10-year contract, and this time giving absolutely no public access for the purposes of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5854.605s">The</a> unfortunate part about all of this, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5857.51s">The</a> technologies are so far advanced out there that if you traverse yourself out to the states of California and in that particular territory, those folks that had even public access on the peg stations are now moving to get rid of them because they are basically alleging that they're serving no purpose other than making a huge cost and a dent in the cost of cable subscription. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5879.714s">I</a> believe Comcast and Verizon, as it relates to both of their service people, have merged in many of those cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5886.409s">as</a> far as the service goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5888.01s">And</a> there is some movement that maybe Xfinity and Verizon might even merge in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5892.374s">But</a> that's just another issue right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5894.435s">Right</a> now we're dealing with the 10-year issue that the city should not go forward and sign this contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5898.999s">And</a> anyone who has Comcast out there right now, send a letter, call the mayor's office, and just tell them not to sign this contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5906.585s">What's</a> Comcast going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5907.666s">Just</a> pick up and walk out of the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5909.047s">I</a> don't think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5910.127s">But</a> the fact of the matter is the technology is so far advanced right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5913.27s">It's</a> out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5913.99s">It's</a> happening right in front of our faces, and Apple, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5916.527s">Couldn't</a> have proved it anymore, as they did last Thursday when they came out online. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5920.05s">They</a> did a seven and a half minute demo of showing how advanced, not only are they over cable television, but the new technologies that are out there, plus their merging and interaction with other subsidiaries that are into this particular type of a situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5935.381s">We've</a> seen also what's happened with the PEG access stations, when communities around us got themselves in trouble by misappropriating the funds, who went to jail for eight years, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5946.693s">Who's</a> being subject to an attorney general investigation? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5949.174s">And</a> it's just not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5952.214s">We</a> have here in our own city of Medford an investigation that's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5955.875s">We</a> were led to believe at some point in time that the public access channel was going to file dissolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5962.137s">And</a> they said they were, and they haven't. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5964.438s">We</a> have papers here tonight that come from the attorney general's office, especially the charitable affairs division, which are basically saying it is still under investigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5974.53s">I</a> don't know how much more investigation it can be when there's hundreds of thousands of dollars missing and unaccounted for. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5980.052s">But</a> when they're missing and unaccounted for, and the mayor of this community sits by and does absolutely nothing about it, and then he wants to even entertain possibly thinking of signing a new 10-year contract with a company that does nothing more than raise the rates each and every time they have a chance. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5998.598s">And</a> it's the same mayor in this community who happens to have a pretty good deal <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6002.908s">Concast,</a> who recently gave him $5,000 for whatever he wanted to use within the community, and I believe there's a $30,000 or thereabout in account that he has used to do whatever he's wanted, unbeknownst to this council as it relates to whatever he feels a charitable event needs to take place here in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6020.302s">You</a> know, Mr. Kelly, who's the Director of Governmental Affairs and Regulations, has never offered that to the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6026.807s">He's</a> never made that away to the taxpayers of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6029.738s">I'm</a> not so sure the mayor would want to sign this because he has a particular perk that he gets out of this for himself to use whatever he wants to use. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6037.065s">I'm</a> not so sure, Mr. President, that public access here in the city of Medford, for which the city has in its coffers in excess of $300,000, if not more, that have been taken from subscribers to Comcast, who have had no public access for well over a year and a half or thereabouts, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6054.237s">is</a> the right way to go now in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6056.398s">The</a> mayor wants to put this new public access channel up at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6060.0s">It</a> is not readily available, it's not easily accessible, it's not on a bus route that way you get off, it's an easily walking distance, and especially at nighttime, it presents itself with a handicap and a public safety issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6073.008s">So</a> with that being said, and recognizing that there was a three-member commission that the mayor empowered earlier this year, whether he agreed or disagreed with the folks that were on there, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6082.678s">They</a> did make recommendations that basically talked about keeping this thing centrally located, easily accessible, and something that could work. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6089.72s">And</a> to this day, the mayor still doesn't have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6093.181s">He's</a> quoted a saying back in 2014, excuse me, before the election, that public access would be made available and it would be in the city of Medford and it would be operational. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6103.023s">Well,</a> where is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6104.223s">It</a> doesn't exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6105.864s">The</a> mayor has taken personal advantage on the public access of Channel 15, the educational channel for his own, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6112.095s">personal</a> use for which he uses personnel from the high school for his own personal public affairs to have him televised anytime he wants on their dime while they should be teaching in school, not doing, they shouldn't be taking care of him. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6127.04s">You</a> know, we just heard tonight from the subcommittee of the council that was on relative to having our council meetings put on the government access. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6134.022s">I</a> mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6134.505s">to</a> be put on the city's website. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6137.045s">That</a> would be a great way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6138.626s">But</a> I doubt it, if the mayor would allow that, because if there's anything that's controversial that doesn't speak well of the mayor, it's not gonna go. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6144.867s">It's</a> not gonna show. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6146.467s">You</a> know, Comcast, they may have been good at one point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6150.828s">I</a> know Councilor Camuso, you had made comment, I think it was last week or two weeks ago, that maybe we should go back and just rescind the order that the council voted on, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6158.769s">We</a> never got an answer back from the city clerk on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6161.25s">So,</a> pardon me?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6171.8s">Okay,</a> so with that being said, be it a homeroom petition or what have you, I don't think it's fair, especially to the ratepayers, who keep paying each and every month, each and every month, each and every month, and getting nothing forward, you know, and that's the problem with society today. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6185.108s">People</a> become so inundated with all these nuances, they just let it go by, and while they let it go by, the city keeps generating money, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6193.311s">In</a> an account that serves no purpose for the rate payers, and at the same time, the mayor has an extreme advantage of taking those monies to be used that he has going with Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6204.518s">And</a> one final comment, Mr. President, you know.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6218.326s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6227.576s">The</a> issue of the 5% is the franchise fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6229.978s">That</a> was a home rule which is broken down to 3, 1, and 1. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6232.2s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6233.021s">With</a> that being said, Mr. President, I just don't think it's fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6236.425s">I</a> don't think the city should go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6238.467s">I</a> think the mayor should be getting, the council should direct them not to sign this contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6243.554s">especially</a> not having a public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6246.036s">And</a> more importantly, what are we getting? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6248.017s">If</a> we lock ourselves into another 10-year deal, God knows what's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6252.339s">The</a> rates, Councilor Caraviello, you just said it, what are we getting? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6255.061s">All</a> we're getting is the rates just keep going up and up and up, and you're getting nothing forward in return. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6259.444s">And</a> it's just not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6261.545s">And</a> with that being said, I'll open it up to anybody, other questions, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6375.283s">Well,</a> a point of, just a point of further clarification.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6378.784s">The</a> peg access is very specific by law. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6380.965s">It</a> has to be used for public access, educational, government channel. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6383.786s">And</a> the other thing that nobody has talked about, why does it have to be for a non-profit? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6387.767s">Why</a> can't it not be for a for-profit? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6390.088s">And</a> if it was a for-profit, you might have a different attitude of people coming in here and saying, hey, not only can we do it and raise money for the community, you don't have to worry about public access because the for-profit will take care of the whole situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6403.45s">And</a> you know, and that's something that the mayor is not even entertained. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6407.074s">He</a> doesn't even, he doesn't have the ability to figure this thing out. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6410.457s">We</a> were paying a guy named Peter Epstein, something like $325 an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6414.741s">And</a> that was the gentleman who did the last hearing 10 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6418.385s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6419.046s">And</a> he has yet to be contacted the last time I spoke to him, which is probably within the past three weeks to a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6424.771s">And</a> so if the mayor has no intention of having this public hearing, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6427.964s">and</a> he intends to have a 10-year contract signed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6431.326s">That's</a> absolutely unfair to every single ratepayer, subscriber in this community, to know what's going on, and at the same time, it doesn't serve the taxpayer any benefit at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6440.752s">They're</a> getting nothing out of this 10-year contract, except the mayor is the one that becomes the beneficiary.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7365.185s">I</a> believe through the years it's been approximately $30,000 that the Mayor's been able to use. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7370.14s">For</a> whatever he feels he wants to use it for.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7477.861s">Councilor</a> Penta was waiting for the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7481.284s">I'd</a> be willing to amend it that reads the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7483.685s">Be</a> it resolved that the Medford City Council go on record <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7486.55s">advising</a> the mayor on behalf of Comcast subscribers not to enter into any contract agreement until a public hearing takes place with Comcast to be effective as of August 20th since, in fact, and I think that's what you were leading to. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7500.637s">Why</a> sign a contract at all? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7502.157s">We</a> haven't even had our public hearing.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7511.299s">Well,</a> that's a separate issue, because right now the contract is—the public vendor's going to have nothing to do with the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7517.36s">Because</a> the contract is— The contract's the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7520.481s">The</a> contract is having a 10-year deal with Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7522.941s">That's</a> where he's going. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7524.101s">Inclusive</a> of the contract is going to be having public access in whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7528.462s">The</a> key here is, if you don't want him to sign a 10-year contract, and you want the public hearing to get input from the community, you do that, or you just tell him not to sign a 10-year contract.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7556.163s">I'll</a> read it again.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7559.464s">Be</a> it resolved that the Medford City Council go on record advising the Mayor on behalf of Comcast subscribers not to enter into any contract agreement <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7568.409s">Hold</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7569.669s">Slow,</a> slow, slow. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7571.41s">All</a> he has to do after the word to, where it says not to, just insert the words enter into any contract agreement until a public hearing takes place with Comcast to be effective as of April 20th and then continue on. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7585.673s">You</a> get it?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7591.494s">After</a> the word to, enter into any contract agreement until a public hearing takes place. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7597.635s">because</a> that is so important. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7599.416s">People</a> don't realize that that public hearing talks about exactly what's going on in this city and what Comcast is offering other than work. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7607.401s">Would</a> you be the rates just keep going up and up and up and nobody's got a chance to talk about this.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7657.345s">They</a> have profit public.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7734.798s">–</a> You can have for-profit that does not have to go through Comcast, because they're not going to come under those regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7740.88s">You</a> will have a legitimate for-profit company come in here and run a cable company. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7746.362s">Well,</a> it'll be a public access, but they won't follow the same guidelines as if you're going to have it under Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7751.363s">That's</a> the difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7753.504s">They</a> have guidelines that they're going to have to follow, but it won't come under the Comcast contract.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7854.956s">I'll</a> somewhat disagree with that, only for one reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7857.057s">The</a> idea of having the public hearing is to get information from the ratepayers that are going to tell you what they like, what they don't like, or what they would like to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7865.022s">Then</a> they take that information and go back and negotiate. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7867.364s">If</a> you don't have any public hearing and you don't have any public information, what are you negotiating?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8107.14s">Mr.</a> President, once again, this week is another one of these weeks relative to the whole parking thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8112.844s">Having</a> discussions with the Chief of Police <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8115.056s">and</a> small business people, people who are getting tickets, machines that just aren't working, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8120.719s">So</a> let me start off with the first one right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8123.481s">Here</a> is a picture of a poll that says 30-minute parking Monday through Saturday, 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8131.225s">to</a> 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8133.606s">On</a> March 10th of this year, that law was changed to 8 to 6. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8139.009s">These</a> signs are still up and people are still getting tickets for which now the chief is getting phone calls <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8145.018s">as</a> it relates to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8146.959s">I</a> have here a ticket that's issued on the 18th of March, where somebody put the money in the meter, and the meter stopped collecting it and collecting it, for which they shouldn't have collected the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8161.943s">Now,</a> Councilor Caraviello, you made a resolution back on December 23rd as it relates to having the city come forward <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8171.334s">and</a> present to the council a 60-day evaluation take place by the mayor and Republican. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8176.638s">The</a> 60 days has come and gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8179.02s">Then</a> on January 2nd of this past year, you also had a resolution as it related to the kiosks on the face of the kiosk being legible so you could read it, and you still can't read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8190.069s">Again</a> this past week, we have the truck, once again, in downtown Medford, in other parts of the city, again in violation of the contract <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8201.134s">Nothing</a> to be seen on the back saying that this truck makes frequent stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8205.738s">The</a> mayor has just intentionally allowed, allowed this company from Republic from Tennessee to go forward and continuously keep breaking and breaking the laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8216.487s">Now,</a> the other part of the contract basically says the following that, you know, we are supposed to be getting some kind of information forthcoming. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8224.854s">I</a> believe today, again, speaking to the chief outside, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8228.439s">He</a> had to go down and speak to some folks next to, I believe, Mystic Valley Pediatrics. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8236.184s">Next</a> to there, there's a beauty shop over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8238.406s">The</a> women over there are up in arms and they're all afraid because they think they're going to get tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8242.689s">Who's</a> parked in the parking lot? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8244.19s">The</a> two kiosks are against the wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8246.912s">The</a> records reflect, as we just get, that in January of this past year before the city council, Republic was supposed to go over and meet with the senior citizens <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8256.786s">to</a> explain to them the whole kiosk. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8259.247s">And</a> here we have here a letter dated March 19th, addressed to you, Council President Dello Russo, that on April 3rd, they're going to go over there and discuss how to use a kiosk. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8269.792s">From</a> January to April 3rd, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8274.055s">Huge.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8274.695s">I</a> mean, they're right on the ball with all of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8277.196s">The</a> fact of the matter is that the machines are still taking the money, and where does that extra money go to? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8282.619s">Is</a> it coming to the city of Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8284.079s">Is</a> it going into Republic? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8285.98s">We</a> talk about the people getting tickets, full-scale observation. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8292.365s">West</a> Method, on Playstead Road, where Playstead Road and Winthrop Street meets, there were 15 to 17 cars on any one given day that used to be parked there, and they never got a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8303.713s">Now</a> you're lucky if you see one, if not two, cars at the very most. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8307.566s">And</a> you know where those cars are parking? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8309.467s">Those</a> cars are parking all on the side streets, and they're going into the neighborhoods, and the complaints are starting to come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8316.572s">Go</a> to the parking lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8318.693s">Supposed</a> to be three-hour parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8321.054s">The</a> sign's still up there for two hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8323.857s">So</a> how do you turn around and give somebody a ticket? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8326.578s">Today,</a> someone who was a business merchant in West Medford and a business merchant in Medford Square who paid their $100 for the pass got themselves tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8336.082s">They</a> got themselves tickets today with the permit because they were parked in the municipal parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8342.585s">On</a> Boston Avenue, in front of this sign over here, where a legitimate delivery was being made, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8349.402s">and</a> the trunk was open and the merchandise was coming out, the guy in the truck goes up there and gives them a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8356.949s">How</a> do you give someone a ticket when you're in a legitimate spot? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8359.571s">Tell</a> me. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8360.532s">Councilor</a> Marks, you made a comment a little while ago when this thing was going on, that once this thing started to get going, you gotta be careful because they're gonna be taking aggressive action. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8370.34s">They're</a> doing more than taking aggressive action. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8372.822s">Look</a> at the tickets that they're giving out. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8374.564s">You'd</a> think they would at least put the courtesy, like every other city in town, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8377.388s">from</a> the back of the ticket that at least gives you the telephone number. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8380.711s">You</a> have to figure out where 557 Main Street is. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8383.293s">A</a> lot of people don't know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8385.174s">A</a> senior citizen, a senior citizen in Medford Square trying to figure out how to put money in the machine when they didn't have any change and they didn't have a credit card and trying to figure it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8397.083s">It</a> just doesn't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8398.164s">Medford</a> is not that type of a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8400.586s">Why</a> the mayor is doing this, I have absolutely no idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8403.928s">But</a> again, he's in complete violation <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8406.905s">The</a> contract has been in complete violation, you know, since this thing operated. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8412.751s">It's</a> beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8414.232s">What</a> about the credit cards that you're putting in? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8416.875s">And</a> they're reading the wrong numbers for the license plate. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8420.078s">Last</a> week we got a complete description. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8421.599s">I</a> have a complete description here from a nurse, a doctor, and the patients that just couldn't negotiate what's going on in Riverside Avenue in that big, huge parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8432.852s">Imagine,</a> we came here, had a big discussion with the people from Republic who stood at that podium that night and said, we are going to go over because the seniors were having a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8441.259s">We'll</a> probably give them 25 pocket spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8443.341s">That</a> was in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8444.602s">And</a> now they're going to go there on April 3rd, which isn't even here yet, April 3rd, to show and discuss with them how to put the money in the machine, which is almost 400 feet away from <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8454.55s">from</a> where they park their cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8456.111s">It</a> makes absolutely no sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8457.552s">Go</a> outside and sit in front of City Hall over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8459.693s">They</a> have a stupid little meter on the corner of the road over there, so if you park all the way in the parking lot over here, you're gonna figure out I gotta walk all the way over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8468.117s">It</a> doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8470.178s">Mr.</a> President, page four of the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8476.461s">I</a> am going to suggest tonight that the city exercises its right, as it states here, to fully terminate this contract <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8484.666s">with</a> Republic before it gets any worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8487.528s">We</a> haven't even seen, we haven't even seen, as we've been told, the next phase of where these kiosks are going to go in. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8495.913s">There</a> are business districts and streets and locations that don't even have them yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8500.896s">Once</a> they have them, this is just going to accelerate and multiply. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8505.099s">I'm</a> going to make an offer here for the mayor tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8508.241s">He</a> can go out of this thing being a hero, rather than having the council come after him. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8512.964s">Mr.</a> Mayor, this is what I'm saying to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8515.311s">You</a> came to the council a few years ago, and you asked us to take a million point two out of our water and sewer surplus account. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8522.133s">Councilman</a> Marks was the only one that voted against it, and looking back, he did the right thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8526.195s">Probably</a> the worst mistake I ever made, but I gave it to you at that point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8529.636s">Never</a> a thank you in return, because that's what we needed to balance the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8534.197s">I'm</a> asking you to take whatever it is <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8537.245s">You</a> take the cost of what the contract says, of what it cost them to put this thing together, you amortize that over the minus the deductions of what we're being paid, and we'll pay the difference, seven, eight, nine hundred thousand dollars, let these people leave this community, let the people go back to their normal way of owning and operating their small little business, not being afraid of getting tagged and towed and ticketed wrongly, not being afraid to know that I'm going to lose a customer, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8565.416s">because</a> they didn't put the money in the meter, not to be afraid of a lady falling down and the snow that's going to be taken by an ambulance to the hospital because she was trying to put her money into the kiosk. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8575.24s">Go</a> out a hero and admit that we made a mistake and we're going to go back to the original idea of having traffic enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8583.924s">We</a> will do this in-house. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8585.484s">We</a> will get local people and we'll move ourselves forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8589.386s">And</a> I think everybody at that point in time would say thank you, Mr. Mayor, for understanding <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8594.775s">the</a> impact that this is going to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8596.717s">You</a> know, Councilor Camuslo, you said something in one of the very first meetings a long time ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8600.68s">You</a> turned around and said that you were in favor of putting parking meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8604.484s">And</a> if parking meters were going to be the issue then, like it would be now, I don't think anybody would have, I think they would have understood it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8611.069s">But</a> this has turned out to be a major, major disaster. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8614.953s">With</a> that being said, Mr. President, I get pictures, I get more and more stories, I get more and more people. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8620.999s">giving</a> me the authority to use their names. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8622.879s">I</a> think it's obvious. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8624.12s">And</a> you know the thing that's really funny about all this? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8626.16s">Can</a> you imagine the mayor having the audacity, and that's the word I would use, the audacity to say, he hasn't received one complaint. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8631.801s">He</a> hasn't received one complaint on this traffic program. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8636.443s">Go</a> walk the streets, Mr. Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8639.543s">Go</a> walk the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8640.964s">Look</a> at these people. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8641.844s">Ask</a> them what they say. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8644.444s">Unbelievable.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8646.065s">That</a> being said, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8647.853s">I</a> know it could be a tough vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8648.994s">Maybe</a> people will want to vote for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8650.276s">Maybe</a> they won't. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8650.896s">But</a> the message goes back to the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8653.058s">You</a> can do it one of two ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8654.54s">You</a> can voluntarily get out of it or the council is going to make a suggestion that you go out of it and terminate this contract with Republic. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8662.228s">And</a> I don't think there's anybody in this room and any businesses in this community that would turn around and say, OK, we can do that, you know, and if we have a problem, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8670.541s">If</a> we have a problem with enforcement, we will address it, but we will address it in-house, and we will start very slow. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8676.504s">We</a> don't have to have an out-of-town company called Republic from Tennessee, who takes almost 68% of the net profit before the city of Medford sees a dime. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8686.59s">And</a> now we're going to be dealing with this type of aggressive taxation on the people of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8693.894s">Plus,</a> it's a 10-year contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8695.515s">How</a> many of these 10-year contracts does this mayor think the people in this community <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8700.879s">should</a> stomach. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8701.52s">It's</a> wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8702.401s">There's</a> no need for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8703.762s">So,</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I move that the city of Medford remove itself, terminate its contract with the Republic of Tennessee—I think that's the name—Republic Parking of Tennessee in the best interests of the taxpayers, the small business people, and the city of Medford as a whole.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8896.171s">Resolution</a> is 14795, December 3rd, 60-day review.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9135.984s">Mr.</a> President, you know, a lot of the times when the Republic was here for a couple of meetings and the chief was here, we gave a whole bunch of concerns that we had, and, you know, we got some of our responses back. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9146.974s">I</a> think the main one was changing the hours from 7 to 7 to 8 to 6. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9152.513s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9152.953s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9166.03s">Also</a> with single head meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9167.291s">Now</a> how do you justify putting up the signs and telling you, you have 30 minute parking, but tagging people? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9174.814s">And</a> then having the audacity, as Councilor Caraviello says, being arrogant, well if you don't like it, appeal it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9179.796s">Why</a> should somebody have to appeal something if they're parked in a spot that's legitimately for 30 minutes, and take some time off from work, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9187.159s">And</a> we don't even have our hearing officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9189.16s">Our</a> hearing officer, unfortunately, she's not in right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9192.56s">And</a> now there's some concern that maybe, that Republic is doing some of these hearings. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9197.982s">I</a> don't know if that's true or false. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9199.302s">Maybe</a> we should make that as another paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9201.182s">Because</a> if they're doing that, that's, again, outside the scope of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9204.903s">You</a> know, you have parking meters taking money after 7 o'clock at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9210.264s">Councilor</a> Caraviello, it was your resolution that said <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9214.606s">No</a> charge for the parking period after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9218.187s">You</a> can delay this thing all you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9220.108s">The</a> fact of the matter is they've had more than enough time. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9223.029s">You</a> can't be driving around since January not having the proper signage on the truck. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9228.011s">It</a> took these to get the signage on the side of the truck and they were still doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9232.698s">I</a> spoke to the chief tonight, and the chief turned around and said, I told Dan Nash, you know, this is unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9237.822s">Well,</a> that's not the point of being unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9239.543s">It's</a> a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9240.524s">If</a> you're in violation of the contract, then so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9243.366s">We</a> put that guy tonight through the torches of hell, the poor guy at Wendy's over an outside thing, and here a multi-million dollar company comes in, and they can walk around and do anything they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9253.093s">Take</a> the money after six o'clock at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9255.654s">Tag</a> people improperly. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9257.956s">I</a> won't say illegally, improperly. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9259.817s">Another</a> guy was in the loading zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9262.218s">Tag</a> a guy who's legitimate in a loading zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9265.119s">It's</a> wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9265.9s">It's</a> wrong, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9268.521s">It's</a> just plain wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9273.244s">You</a> guys can do whatever you want, ladies, but all I know is, I'm moving on the question, strongly suggesting to the mayor to terminate the contract ASAP, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9282.202s">and</a> behalf of the taxpayers of this community, because of their failure to abide by the contract as amended, and that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9288.547s">You</a> know, another thing, you know, and I think it was you, Adam, who came up with, and rightfully so, the suggestion about the signs, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9298.015s">It</a> was a violation of the contract and the signs and this and that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9300.397s">And</a> now because of that, you don't see any of these signs up. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9303.459s">If</a> you go and you talk to them and they say, well, it's the city's fault. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9306.702s">The</a> city's fault for what? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9308.523s">That</a> you've got the wrong signs up and you're not, and you've not been putting <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9312.086s">the</a> proper signs up, and you haven't changed the two hours to three hours in certain parts of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9318.147s">And</a> you have certain parts of residential neighborhoods that have kiosks in front of them that don't belong there. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9323.069s">And</a> don't buy it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9324.669s">With</a> all due respect, Mr. President, I'm going to move the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9327.41s">MR.</a> PICARDY.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9360.772s">Whatever</a> the cost is, yes.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9379.83s">Well,</a> there are violations in the contract that have to have offsets to it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9390.789s">I'd</a> rather give him the direction rather than sitting down, but again, I've had enough direction, but before this group, as I say to you, I get I get these calls all day long.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9506.871s">For</a> the contract, I think it's a 90-day clause, and then they have to work it out.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11161.542s">I</a> heard what you said. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11162.462s">I</a> heard what everybody said. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11164.563s">That</a> this is what I get every single day between phone calls and dealing with people. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11168.564s">And</a> the fact of the matter is that that guy over there says nobody's complained. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11172.846s">Well,</a> if nobody's complained to him and we've all heard the complaints, either by phone calls, letters, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11178.53s">people</a> getting tagged signs going up. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11181.615s">There</a> was nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11182.356s">There's</a> no honoring that for which the contract says they were supposed to be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11187.598s">I'm</a> not going to continue to go on. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11189.179s">There</a> are more important things to do out here. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11190.761s">We</a> have a resolution coming up talking about potholes in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11194.403s">That's</a> going to be huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11195.464s">It's</a> going to be so huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11197.666s">That's</a> just one of many things. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11200.028s">And</a> the mayor's worried about having his community day, having this and having that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11203.61s">I'm</a> more concerned about how this city should run according to every single day. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11209.275s">You</a> know, you can talk about the snowstorm all you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11212.177s">What's</a> a snowstorm have to do with somebody doing their job? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11215.57s">So</a> if there's an embargo on there because of a snowstorm, okay, nobody got your tickets?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11223.735s">I'm</a> saying, no tickets on the snow emergency, we understand, they gave tickets, whatever it is.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11229.619s">But</a> putting that aside, that should not stop life from going on, from them to do their job, like they're supposed to. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11236.022s">I</a> shouldn't have to speak to the chief every time, and he tells me, I spoke to Dan Nash, they're supposed to be doing this, they're supposed to be doing that, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11242.648s">When</a> people get a ticket, and this is what did it for me today, yesterday, when people get a ticket, and they're parked legitimately, and they have to go and appeal the ticket, and take time off from work, knowing that they were in the proper spot, and then the guy has, you talk about being arrogant, that's the bottom line, being arrogant, not even I'm sorry, when it's supposed to be eight to six. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11265.298s">And</a> they're still collecting money out of the machines after seven o'clock at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11269.659s">When</a> you, Councilor Caraviello, on January 2nd talked about having the fascia of the machine in good shape, and it's still. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11276.641s">We</a> asked to put a light on top of the kiosk so people could see something at nighttime. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11280.701s">And</a> what about somebody coming into the square late at night or in the afternoon? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11283.962s">How</a> are they supposed to figure out that that box way down the street, I've got to go get a ticket and walk it back to my car? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11290.484s">And</a> who the hell didn't remember their number plate? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11292.304s">and</a> put the quarter in, and not put the quarter in, and the credit card. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11295.146s">No,</a> I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11296.046s">I</a> hear what all you said, but you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11298.728s">I</a> say it, I do it every single day. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11301.609s">As</a> far as I'm concerned, the mayor can do it, doesn't have to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11304.371s">You</a> guys can vote on it, don't vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11306.112s">This</a> is how I feel, and this is the direction I want to go.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11725.41s">Mr.</a> President, it's quite obvious the Baker administration has done something a little bit different than the prior administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11731.934s">They're</a> holding cities and towns accountable, they're giving them deadlines, and they're indicating it's a use it or lose it program. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11738.118s">And</a> at the same time, with our council making the request <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11741.915s">the</a> administration take a million dollars out of free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11745.497s">This,</a> I think, works hand-in-glove with the street restoration program that I offered here some weeks back, that every single taxpayer in this community should identify their particular street, either by phone, by taking a picture, sending it in, and hopefully getting something that's time-stamped and dated, either from the clerk's office or from the Department of Public Works. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11765.528s">That</a> way, they are showing some authenticity as to what they're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11769.787s">Again,</a> anyone who might be watching, news media that's out there, anyone that has a problem on their street, a crack, a road depression, a sidewalk or a curbing or whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11782.853s">If</a> some damage took place during this past winter, take the picture, make a request, put it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11789.015s">And</a> I think that needs to be something that the city council should get a handle on as to how many requests came in and how is the city going to make its determination. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11798.433s">The</a> $143,000 is a limited amount, as we can tell, but I think it would be something that gets the ball rolling, knowing that we have that to start off with. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11806.156s">And</a> I know we have another million dollars, hopefully, that the mayor will go forward and expend for the purpose of the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11811.758s">There</a> isn't one street you can't go down that there is not a depression, a pothole, a sinkhole, or whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11817.74s">Front</a> ends, cars, tires, and everything under the sun has been attacked this winter, unfortunately because of the storm. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11825.703s">It</a> is what it is, and that being the case, Mr. President, I move forward on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11830.306s">And</a> I like—we haven't gotten a report back, and I think we deserve a report back on the request that the Council made and to have an idea just what this administration intends to do over and beyond the $143,000, since, in fact, we asked for a million dollars to be taken out of free cash to be used for something that's desperately needed on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11850.26s">And</a> this is like a subject matter that I was talking about, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11854.056s">The</a> parking enforcement, you know, you could talk about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11857.878s">The</a> problems are still going to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11859.238s">But</a> this is something that's happening every single day. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11861.339s">It's</a> in the face of the single taxpayer in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11864.501s">And</a> they don't deserve to have their streets turned into a battleground territory, unfortunately, because of what happened during the winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11872.784s">We</a> have a responsibility to these ratepayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11874.945s">They</a> pay taxes in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11876.626s">They</a> pay the salaries of everybody in this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11878.887s">And</a> they deserve their streets to be repaired.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12283.668s">This</a> one was jam-packed. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12285.309s">In</a> all the years that I've served, I've never seen so many people attend <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12291.502s">That</a> was really a heart-throbbing particular day. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12296.703s">But</a> I couldn't help but think when I looked up into that ceiling and I was hoping that that ceiling did not fall down. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12301.745s">That's</a> a disgrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12303.425s">That's</a> been like that for almost two years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12306.706s">It's</a> patched. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12309.767s">You're</a> right, Councilor Dello Russo, the whole building is a disgrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12312.428s">The</a> unfortunate part about it, this place was marred. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12315.589s">Mr.</a> President, will you get an answer on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12318.609s">Find</a> out, are they going to repair this or not? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12321.716s">You</a> know, this is the city, this is the people's chambers, and this has been two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12328.562s">The</a> top of the roof, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12330.884s">God,</a> I don't know what he's thinking on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12332.325s">Maybe</a> he just doesn't care what's going on, but there were people here that do care. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12335.688s">Madam</a> Vice President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12627.421s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12630.243s">Councilor</a> Penta wishes the records to be recorded as speaking as a member of the Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12635.665s">Municipal</a> Association. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12637.218s">Board</a> of Directors and not as a city councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12639.525s">If</a> you go to 17.22 on the tape, that's exactly what I said.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12649.902s">Well,</a> I want to be as exact as can be.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12718.61s">And</a> all I added on is was as a member of the Massachusetts Board of Directors and not as a city councilor, because that's exactly what I said. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12726.811s">17.22</a> into the minutes.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12748.401s">No,</a> no, no, no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12750.041s">No,</a> the action on the paper was actually to be to be advised <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12754.788s">And</a> to report back from the administration any plans to increase the charge of the plan for the employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12759.891s">So</a> there was action? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12761.351s">It</a> was a request, yeah, to get information.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12778.82s">You</a> know what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12784.924s">I</a> understand that, but my speaking, I wanted to be recorded as speaking as a member of the Mass Municipal Board of Directors and not as a city councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12792.889s">My</a> vote might have been a city councilor, but my speaking was not. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12797.612s">Whatever.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12823.717s">–</a> They support G.I.C., yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12825.359s">This</a> goes back to 2009, when this council voted on it, they talked about it, and they discussed it.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12873.58s">There's</a> a motion for approval on the record.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12878.402s">Wait,</a> wait, wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12879.102s">What</a> are they? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12879.542s">What</a> are the words? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12880.463s">Read</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12881.503s">The</a> way he presented it to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12885.086s">Read</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12886.226s">I</a> don't have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12886.767s">Read</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12887.487s">What</a> is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12887.828s">You</a> have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12888.568s">What</a> did he give you? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12889.208s">It's</a> the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12890.409s">What</a> is it, Eddie? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12891.03s">Just</a> read it, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12892.331s">I</a> don't have the records in front of me.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12910.813s">No,</a> no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12912.014s">You</a> said you accepted before wishes to be recorded as speaking as a member of the Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12917.056s">So</a> then we go back to the original one.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12938.206s">Not</a> asked to be recorded. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12940.267s">Wishes</a> to be recorded.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12958.956s">And</a> I said that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12959.516s">That's</a> exactly what I said that day.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12970.64s">You</a> have to read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12972.261s">Read</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12972.661s">Nobody's</a> reading the words. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12974.122s">You</a> have it, Mr. Clark. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12975.303s">What</a> are the words?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12988.971s">I'm</a> going by what you had last time. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12990.873s">It</a> says Councilor Penta wishes to be recorded. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12993.387s">speaking</a> as a member of the Mass Municipal Association.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=13018.467s">That's</a> the motion.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_bmoMuW8NubA/2025-03-21_bmoMuW8NubA.html">Medford City Council - March 17, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=304.455s">Thank</a> you, Madam Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=306.197s">Counsel</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=307.858s">I</a> think the idea was a good idea, but I think I'll take you up on the second part of the suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=312.701s">Councilor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=313.302s">Um,</a> I think, um, what's necessary here is to, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=317.158s">see</a> what comes out of tomorrow night's meeting, just see what we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=321.239s">And</a> then look at the ordinances that might be out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=323.92s">You</a> know, the governor has an opiate program that he's embroiling on a statewide basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=330.542s">And</a> maybe, once again, looking at making contact with him. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=333.503s">But</a> since seeing that resolution on there, there's a lady you might want to add to your list. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=338.924s">And</a> her name is Joanne Peterson. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=341.305s">And</a> she's the founder and the executive director of Learn to Cope, Inc. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=344.666s">It's</a> Learn to Cope, Inc. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=346.485s">And</a> they have been pretty active on all of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=352.249s">Also,</a> I was contacted by parishioners at St. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=356.271s">Joseph</a> Parish for anyone who right now is embroiled with some type of an addiction in your family, or the addiction yourself being the individual, that on every Friday at 11 o'clock in the lower <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=372.603s">chapel</a> of the church. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=374.485s">They</a> have an addiction program that runs anywhere from 11 to 12 o'clock on, and it's open to the public for anyone, no matter what. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=381.171s">It</a> doesn't make any difference what you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=382.773s">They're</a> there to help anyone for solace or for whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=386.296s">That's</a> ongoing. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=388.198s">And</a> if you want to check them out, that's adoration24sj.comcast.net. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=395.425s">Speaking</a> with some of the folks in the governor's <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=398.277s">opiate</a> program, and they're taking this, as you know, very seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=401.018s">This</a> is his number two priority when he came on. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=403.599s">And</a> I think we can get a wealth of information not only from them. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=407.68s">I</a> think to put the ordinance together, right now it just might be just a spec premature because the direction that you'd want the ordinance to go in, is it going to be basically a conduit? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=418.183s">Is</a> it going to be a person that's actually going to be able to resolve the problem or not? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=421.604s">It</a> could be a two-pronged approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=423.364s">And</a> I like the idea that we're taking the first step forward, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=426.313s">I</a> think maybe after a couple of meetings, once you see what's on the table, I think you can have a better idea of making the audience become more forceful. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=433.878s">So</a> I would support that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=435.279s">But</a> again, once again, that lady is very helpful as far as this goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=442.143s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Penta.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=939.553s">Whether</a> you want to put this as a B paper or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=941.734s">Um,</a> when Councilor Camuso mentioned NACON, I believe that that was brought up at the last time we met here. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=946.456s">And</a> I believe that there's already been a niche, a first meeting that's taken place between fire EMTs and police folks on this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=953.379s">So</a> could we get an update just where is the city of Medford on this issue of NACON and are they going to provide it for the, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=960.202s">Police,</a> fire, and emergency services here in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=963.183s">Not</a> cam, not cam. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=964.003s">I</a> think that will be part of our committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=966.223s">Well,</a> I want to make this a separate paper because if this is already something that's ongoing in the works, I think we should be apprised of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=975.625s">All</a> three of them, emergency responders, fire police, and EMTs.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1729.344s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1730.285s">Mr.</a> President and council colleagues, but more importantly, our subscribers within our community, we're dealing with the end of a 10 year contract that Comcast has had here with the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1742.091s">And</a> as everyone knows for the past few months, if not for the past, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1746.003s">a</a> couple of years in particular, this Medford City Council has been actively requesting more information, not only on Comcast, but also as it relates to our public access channels here in the city of Medford as to what's been going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1760.928s">Most</a> recently, and it's kind of like disturbing, there have been accounts coming out of the courthouses and all across the Commonwealth, but as it relates to public access channels. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1772.451s">For</a> example, there was a judge <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1774.733s">regarding</a> the Saugus Community Cable Television. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1777.455s">It</a> was now put a stop order against the Saugus Community Cable Television because of their refusal to allow the local board of selectmen to discuss certain aspects of public access and telecasting over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1794.084s">The</a> Attorney General's Office, just this past week, is now suing the Lynn Community Access Channel. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1800.307s">And</a> they're alleging that these defendants abused their positions of power <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1804.059s">and</a> were responsible for the misappropriation of charitable funds from this non-profit, said Attorney General Healy. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1810.523s">Actions</a> such as the ones alleged here cause financial harm to the charity and its mission and undermine the public's trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1817.267s">We</a> hope that through this action we can recover the money rightfully owed back to the charity, which is the non-profit, which happens to be the public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1824.852s">We</a> have here in the city of Medford, dating back to, I believe, July of last year, a multiple request of the Medford's TV3 public access channel <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1834.465s">who</a> supposedly filed a resolution of dissolution just past September. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1839.709s">But</a> it was our city solicitor who, at that point in time, sent us a huge packet of information demanding certain documents to be coming forward from the people who were managing the public access channel. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1852.38s">And</a> he gave them a time deadline for which they did not respond. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1855.662s">I</a> believe also, too, our city solicitor indicated that, I think it was either July or August of this past year, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1861.953s">that,</a> in fact, that if they did not respond, that he would pursue other legal avenues. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1868.058s">I</a> don't know what those avenues have been. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1869.699s">I</a> don't know if any of those avenues have taken place. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1872.701s">But</a> we are now here in March of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1878.125s">I've</a> just received on my desk here right now tonight, I think we all did, a letter dated December 18, 2014, delivered to the Honorable Michael J. McGlynn from Thomas Kelly, director from Xfinity. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1892.555s">Last</a> paragraph, sentence in the last paragraph, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1895.897s">We</a> believe this renewal proposal substantially meets the community cable related needs while taking into account the cost to individual subscribers in accordance with section 626 B and C of the cable. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1907.203s">Best</a> part, the city has an obligation under the formal renewal process to either accept or deny Comcast proposal within four months or no later than April 18th. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1918.75s">We,</a> this has been in city hall since December 18th. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1922.62s">This</a> is now March 17th, with less than a month and a day to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1928.225s">And</a> we're just finding this out now. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1931.427s">The</a> mayor, I believe, has a responsibility, as he did some 10 years ago, to have a public hearing allowing ratepayers, citizens, anybody who are proponents or opponents to the renewal of the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1945.719s">We</a> have asked, I believe intimately, over the past few months, when is this contract renewal <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1951.58s">public</a> hearing going to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1953.861s">We</a> received no responses on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1955.461s">If</a> you go to page 26, and this is just a quick perusal to this thing, on the top it says, in the event that the issuing authority or other PEG access user elects not to fully program its channels with original PEG access programming, the licensee may reclaim any unused time on those channels. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1975.394s">Now,</a> I don't know where we're going with all of that, but that tells me that if the mayor of this community refuses or so chooses not to engage public access anymore in this community, that in fact, Comcast can take over that Channel 3 and do whatever it wants, and the city would not be able to get monies that they have in the past on public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1998.462s">Looking</a> at this real quick, I could be wrong, but I think that's the way it reads. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2002.104s">Also,</a> and more importantly, why would we even want to engage in another 10-year contract? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2007.446s">Look</a> what's happened with our rubbish contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2009.808s">We're</a> engaged with them for 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2011.568s">We</a> just got embroiled with a ridiculous 10-year kiosk program here in the city, you know, a meter program. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2017.992s">And</a> now we're looking at a renewal to a <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2021.213s">public</a> acts strike that to a cable contract for 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2025.175s">But</a> the difference on this cable contract from the last one is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2028.496s">The</a> technology has become so advanced out there right now that we really don't know within the next 10 years if new technology can supersede that for which Comcast is giving to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2040.401s">My</a> advice would be, and since the mayor is obviously not having his public hearing, I have no idea why. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2045.743s">He</a> has got one month and one day to pull this off, which is a <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2049.303s">period</a> of time to get intelligent people down here to talk about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2052.926s">But</a> rather than go forward with a 10-year contract, I would probably make a recommendation that we have a three-year contract, with a two-year contract possible for renewal, at that point in time, just to see where we're going with all of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2065.897s">It</a> makes no sense to say, yes, we're going forward for 10 years, when you're not having a public meeting and a public forum, for which I believe—I'm not—don't hold me to it, but I believe that that was part of the licensing. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2078.217s">and</a> the relicensing process. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2080.537s">And,</a> you know, unfortunately, just getting this tonight and trying to peruse it, I mean, that's one part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2085.918s">The</a> other part of it is we haven't still gotten any accounting of monies allegedly not found or misappropriated or what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2095.2s">We</a> haven't gotten a full accounting of the inventory that was down there, if it's been sold, if it's been used or what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2104.261s">And</a> here we are engaging ourselves, if this be the case, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2107.738s">with</a> a potential 10-year contract, and then looking at surrounding cities and towns where not only the attorney general has stepped in, but you also have it with Lynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2116.582s">You</a> have it in Saugus. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2117.862s">You</a> have it in Bolton. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2119.363s">And</a> you have it in Rehoboth, where the guy got eight years, eight years in jail for misappropriating funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2126.066s">You</a> have problems with Wincambe and Winchester. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2129.598s">These</a> are things that are just surrounding us. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2131.241s">And</a> we're living right in the middle of all of this right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2134.306s">And</a> we can't get answers to satisfy what we have, never mind going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2138.953s">So</a> I look at this as a three-pronged approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2140.776s">Number</a> one. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2141.86s">We</a> have no public hearing for which I think we should have. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2144.341s">Number</a> two, we still don't even have anything resolved as TV3 and the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2149.762s">Accountability</a> not only from inventory, accountability from records and for tax filings, for bank accounts and who's on them and who's allowed to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2161.505s">And</a> also, getting involved with a 10-year contract that's right around the corner, I don't think it would serve the rate payers of this community well. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2169.387s">I</a> think it would serve them a lot better <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2171.144s">if</a> they had an opportunity to maybe have a three-year contract with a two-year renewal, if that be the case, to see where we're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2176.849s">The</a> state and the art of technology is so advanced today that who knows where we're going to be able to be at that point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2182.653s">And</a> if we get locked into something that we can't get out of, it might cost subscribers more money in the years 7, 8, 9, and 10, or 6, or whatever it might be, than what they could possibly get with a more advanced contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2195.424s">It</a> shocks me how this city just runs itself with these 10-year contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2199.828s">And</a> nobody is looking for a 10-year contract other than Comcast and the mayor of this community who is allowing this to go forward without even having a public hearing to have any kind of a discussion on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2211.074s">Some</a> two weeks, I think it was two weeks ago this past Monday, going two and a half weeks ago, I spoke with the attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2216.056s">He</a> was representing the city of Medford on their public access information and legalese stuff, whatever it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2225.241s">He</a> told me as of two, two and a half weeks ago, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2227.315s">He</a> has had absolutely no contact with the City of Medford on its renewal with Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2232.337s">So</a> I don't know where we're going with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2234.157s">I</a> don't think anyone behind this reel knows where we're going with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2236.918s">But</a> I really think that we need to send a message to the mayor and behalf of the subscribers that something needs to stop on the tracks and we don't need another 10-year contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2246.001s">I</a> think we need to have a real look and see, a public hearing, and have some open and public discussion.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2346.896s">In</a> the second paragraph, it says that the city is getting $350,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2349.738s">I</a> believe the prior contract, the city got $450,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2353.741s">Rick?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2354.522s">So</a> we're going down $75,000 on what they're going to give us. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2360.826s">They're</a> looking for another 10-year contract, and we don't even know what the hell we're getting.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2494.18s">Rick,</a> I think the question that you're really wanting to ask, by what law are we required to sign to approve a 10-year contract? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2503.963s">That,</a> I think, needs to be the question rather than— Let me say, because what happens after April 18th?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4175.343s">Just</a> rescind the renewal period until such time... No, we can't rescind the renewal.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4225.442s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4227.303s">To</a> you, Councilor Camuso, I hear what you want to do, and it sounds like it's a good idea, but this is a renewal, and I don't have anything in front of me that says that a renewal becomes automatic by the mayor, because if that's the case, what are we even discussing anything? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4240.513s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4241.593s">Also,</a> in one of the pages that we were received here, you know, there's a whole list of <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4246.921s">what</a> the peg access provider needs to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4249.403s">It's</a> different than the original contract, or it's an addendum to the original contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4253.446s">So</a> that in and of itself talks about being different. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4256.628s">Mr.</a> Clerk, not to put you on the hot seat, but the only thing that disturbs me with this whole thing is it says CC here, City Clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4263.894s">Do</a> you ever remember getting this, December 18th?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4307.47s">Let</a> me finish my comment, please.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4310.69s">So</a> wait a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4311.11s">It</a> goes to the same point. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4312.571s">So</a> we heard the clerk say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4314.531s">But</a> if this has been sitting there since December 18th, because it definitely went to the mayor, and it did go by UPS, and somebody upstairs in his office, and now we're a month and a day away from the four months. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4324.853s">Something's</a> going on because there's no public hearing being held or anything.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4346.592s">Well,</a> point of clarification, Mr. President, the city clerk is aware of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4349.835s">He</a> just got through explaining to you how and why it got there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4352.71s">It's</a> a document that CCs the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4355.331s">It's</a> addressed to the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4356.692s">It's</a> regarding a renewal process for which we're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4359.894s">So</a> this is a very important issue.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4439.485s">Now,</a> wait a minute.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4468.727s">Also,</a> can we amend that for it?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4474.19s">Can</a> I move to Councilor, I want to amend his paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4477.753s">Councilor</a> Camuso.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4481.615s">Councilor</a> Camuso, on your paper, can we amend that one step further as it relates to, you want the city solicitor, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4489.789s">likewise</a> to report back. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4491.269s">But</a> at the same time, remember, Comcast used to be Time Warner, and before Time Warner was another one. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4497.89s">So</a> we have an interloping of three different cable providers here in the city during that period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4505.012s">And</a> I think when you change from A to B, that's going to cut the thing to Time Warner. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4510.733s">Also,</a> I'd like to amend it to ask the question, when and if the public hearing is going to take place on this renewal? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4519.526s">So</a> amended by Councilor Penta.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4730.072s">Well,</a> I'm sorry.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4732.213s">Move</a> to rescind, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4733.353s">Last</a> vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4733.793s">He</a> can move to rescind all he wants.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4741.016s">So</a> you're going to tell me I can't speak on the motion now?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4780.37s">Well,</a> you didn't even let me finish the reason why I just said before that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4787.072s">No,</a> no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4787.652s">He's</a> so quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4788.192s">He</a> thinks he can read my mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4789.393s">Let</a> him take his vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4793.074s">I'm</a> not out after you at all.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4848.922s">No,</a> listen, no, because he thought he was so smart. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4851.383s">He</a> knew what he was going to do.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4889.793s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4892.174s">Since</a> last week, I received, I think it was 14 phone calls from folks who thought this was a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4897.176s">I</a> believe that they have spoken to some folks in the highway department who also thought it was a good idea, which would be helpful to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4904.282s">Subsequent</a> to last week, and I want to thank our city clerk, Mr. Finn, he sent me in a direction that brought me to a town in Florida, Jacksonville, Florida, that engaged in something quite similar, not exactly the same, but quite similar as it relates to groups of citizens getting together within the community, finding storefronts, vacant spots, spots that need to be rehabilitated, going to the landowners and to the city and working out deals as it relates to, once again, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4933.972s">bringing</a> their streets back to life. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4936.835s">This</a> whole idea of the street recovery program includes curbing, the lights, paneled sidewalks, and parts of the city and parts of the sections of the business districts that are just not getting any life at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4952.628s">It's</a> a master plan that I believe should work hand in hand with the new Department of Public Works building that we're having built for $15 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4961.634s">Also,</a> at the same time, it's, I won't call it an adjunct, but it runs itself similar to the Mass Department of Public Transportation on their new Mass Highway Street Identifying Program, where I think they're up to over 300 folks who either sent in pitches or sent in locations where there are potholes on the major highways here of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4982.191s">So</a> I think it's a catch that we can take advantage of. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4986.534s">Like</a> I said, it's something that seems to be getting good response. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4993.474s">On</a> another issue, liking to this, in downtown Medford Square, in the heart of your business district, you have five lights out within, five street lights out, in the major part of your downtown area, and they've been out for almost three to four weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5008.96s">I</a> mean, you're not gonna have people come in, I don't know what the mayor can't see on a daily basis, but when you let your street lights out, you're losing visibility, number one, but you're presenting a public safety matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5020.304s">And</a> this is something that it's inherent in this whole idea <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5023.441s">of</a> the Street Recovery Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5025.423s">And</a> bringing it up for the 14th time, I will bring it up, and that's the parking lot behind St. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5029.926s">Joseph's</a> Church on Route 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5031.968s">No</a> lights, a definite public safety problem, and it doesn't offer anything for the people of this community after five o'clock at night when it gets dark. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5039.534s">Now</a> it's a little bit lighter, but all winter long, and as I explained before, we had a couple of incidences over the year where there was a drug deal that went on in one situation, another lady got afraid to go to her car because there were people in the parking lot, and still nothing has taken place. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5053.084s">We've</a> been told by the city that they're responsible for it for the five years that they have the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5057.747s">I</a> believe the contract is up. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5059.288s">I</a> don't know what's going on after that, but again, it's a public safety issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5062.55s">But</a> I just want to bring attention to the fact that again, I want to thank Mr. Finn. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5067.533s">Uh,</a> you sent me in a direction that sent me in a further direction, uh, which has been very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5071.636s">I'll</a> just continue to bring on more and more information. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5074.098s">And</a> I would hope that the mayor takes advantage of this and jumps on board with this because the citizen road recovery program, you can go down any street in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5081.511s">every</a> major pothole that's taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5084.912s">And</a> Department of Public Works folks, I mean, they can't see every pothole because it's obvious, there's a lot of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5089.993s">But</a> the people of this community, there's 57, 58,000 of you, you could be the eyes and ears of every street, every corner, every sidewalk, every light, every manhole cover, whatever it might be out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5099.755s">It</a> would make a great inventory to start with for the Department of Public Works to go forward and take back and rejuvenate these city streets and sidewalks that are just in desperate need of repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5110.138s">So</a> I just wanted to, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5111.488s">bring</a> that to the attention of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5116.051s">Well,</a> that's part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5116.991s">The</a> other thing is the mayor going to respond back on this, because if he's not going to do it, I think it's another issue that the council needs to address.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5140.817s">Mr.</a> President, not since I believe, I think it was, I see somebody from the audience sitting over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5145.881s">I</a> think it was in either January or February last year when we met, is the last time we had any discussion on this issue of the Craddock Bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5153.727s">We've</a> received no updates from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5159.511s">And</a> now from what the reference, and I have a whole folder here, and from what I understand, and this is just scuttlebutt because I haven't gotten it from anybody, what was supposed to have been started last fall is not happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5170.666s">was</a> supposed to be starting this spring, and it's right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5173.908s">It's</a> not happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5175.108s">And</a> nobody has any idea when this Kratik Bridge is going to see any kind of resurrection or what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5180.871s">But</a> taking that also into consideration, this idea that it would take over a year to remove or to move all the underground conduits that represent telephone lines, electricity, and everything, that's kind of hard to believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5195.458s">Because</a> when you speak to other engineers in other cities and towns, and you explain this to them, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5199.93s">They</a> just can't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5201.23s">I</a> mean, with the technology that's out there today, why does it have to take a year? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5205.332s">But</a> not only that, this bridge has been there for well over 100 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5208.453s">It's</a> not sinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5210.174s">So</a> I guess the better question is, why do we have to get ourselves even involved? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5214.035s">And</a> it's now up to over a $13 million bridge as of last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5218.737s">For</a> maybe the bridge just needs a pavement, a reconstruction on the top portion of it, rather than going through this multi-million dollar extravaganza. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5227.639s">The</a> businesses in Medford Square cannot handle another setback and an opportunity to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5233.644s">Bad</a> enough, there's no reason for anyone to want to come to Medford Square at nighttime, other than two restaurants. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5241.111s">Name</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5242.012s">There's</a> no bookstore, that's gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5243.353s">There's</a> no movie theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5244.374s">There's</a> nothing there for the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5246.336s">There's</a> no arts and crafts that are taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5249.279s">It's</a> a professional office community in downtown Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5253.805s">And</a> banks, and banks, excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5255.787s">Banks,</a> pizza parlors, and hairdressers. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5257.509s">But</a> they all close at nighttime. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5259.893s">So,</a> you know, we talk about rejuvenating Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5262.835s">Under</a> this administration, he's talked about it three times, and three times, this is what you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5268.058s">Stores</a> that are continuously being empty, nothing that fosters good growth and good development, and there's absolutely no diversity in the type of businesses that are in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5277.103s">And</a> now we're still dealing with the bridge that have people still concerned that if the bridge goes in, what happens to their business, or how is it going to affect traffic, the public safety, and the bridge that's on the Route 9. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5288.69s">You</a> know, here's another thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5289.939s">When</a> you go to Medford Square on Main Street, the overpass there, the lights are all out. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5294.401s">They're</a> down to one light. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5296.542s">There</a> used to be six lights, and they're all out. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5298.883s">You</a> call up. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5299.783s">It's</a> not us. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5300.463s">Call</a> the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5301.044s">The</a> city says it's the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5302.424s">The</a> state says it's DCR. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5304.085s">I</a> don't know whose responsibility it is, but it's a public safety issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5307.326s">And</a> as this continues to go on, the Craddock Bridge seems to be the culprit, so to speak, because everything revolves around what's going to come out of the Craddock Bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5315.89s">All</a> kinds of monies are supposedly tied into the Craddock Bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5319.658s">Mr.</a> President, I think we need a response back from the Commonwealth of Mass, not from the mayor, not from any other politician, from the Commonwealth of Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5328.505s">It's</a> on their agenda to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5330.486s">We</a> need to know, and I think all the businesses need to know, when they're coming into the city and they're going to begin business.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5413.509s">Mr.</a> President, I guess it's now starting to escalate to the point that people are willing to acknowledge what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5424.059s">Today,</a> having an at length conversation with Medford Pediatrics and Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5429.057s">and</a> with a three and a half page memo that was sent to me by the employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5433.359s">And</a> I have the names that they are acknowledged and are willing to have made public. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5438.541s">These</a> are people who come there with their children. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5440.941s">These</a> are senior citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5442.062s">This</a> is the doctor that runs the place that's in charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5444.983s">Excuse</a> me, this is the nurse who's in charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5447.984s">It's</a> just an ongoing saga that just took place over the past couple of days, starting off with a senior citizen, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5456.4s">A</a> husband and a wife went there and they were just so upset as to how to handle the kiosk that they had to come into the office of Medford Pediatrics to get some help as it relates to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5468.683s">Also,</a> I believe somebody from Medford Pediatrics made a request to the mayor concerning some of the concerns that they had and they never got a response back from the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5478.569s">Also,</a> parents having to go back. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5480.53s">We</a> have a situation here where a lady came in with a stroller and with her kids, not realizing that the kiosks were there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5486.754s">We</a> have pictures here that the kiosks were there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5489.756s">And</a> recognizing that the kiosks were there, she had to go back out and she had to leave her kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5494.44s">And</a> while the kid was in the, as everybody knows, if you have a little child, especially at a young age, the kid was screaming and yelling. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5500.243s">The</a> kid didn't want the mother to leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5502.445s">And</a> unfortunately she winds up getting a ticket, not knowing that she had to go back out there and put the money into the kiosk. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5507.74s">Then</a> we have another situation where the people who put the change in didn't have an exchange, and they had no credit card. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5516.706s">They</a> always came paid by a check, not knowing that the kiosks were there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5521.569s">So</a> having no money to put either change or whatever, they had to go, once again, ask the people in the method pediatrics if we could have some change to go out there for which they were <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5535.51s">gracious</a> enough to do, but at the same time, unfortunately, once again, they got a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5540.152s">And</a> by the way, the gentleman in the little white car that goes into that pocket, and by all of these people, have been represented as being very rude to the people and their concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5550.255s">Also,</a> today, I believe, mother's name is Kim Ruane, not accepting coins, and that was giving out the wrong receipts. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5558.878s">So</a> as she went in and put her money in, another lady came in, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5563.886s">not</a> realizing that she had to put the money in, and then she did put the money in, but the receipt was not the right receipt with the right registration for the right person.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5585.076s">Mystic</a> Valley, I'm sorry, Mystic Valley Pediatrics. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5587.297s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5587.637s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5590.263s">They</a> were given the wrong receipts after they put in the right number. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5593.564s">Then</a> there was a lady who parked her car on, where is this one here? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5598.565s">Okay,</a> here was a car, she pulled up to the spot, and once she pulled up to the spot, she was going to get out of the car and to go to the kiosk. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5607.186s">And</a> the guy was giving her a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5610.367s">Okay,</a> and she said, I'm going to the kiosk to put the money in, and she got the ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5616.288s">And</a> not only did she get the ticket, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5620.09s">She</a> put the money in the ticket, and she came back, and she says, look it here. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5623.473s">He</a> grabbed the receipt from her and gave her another ticket because there was no money. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5628.056s">Because</a> look it, that's the wrong registration on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5630.618s">Because</a> he probably thought, for whatever it might be, she was lying, or whatever it could be. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5635.262s">So</a> she winds up getting two tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5637.103s">And</a> this seems to be symptomatic for three people. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5639.525s">Then</a> another lady in Mystic Valley Pediatrics went in after her, showed her receipt, and the receipt had her registration number on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5648.152s">This</a> is not making any sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5650.068s">There's</a> a dentist in Medford Square where a person went in to have some work done in the dentist shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5654.271s">And</a> while they're in the dentist shop, one of the ladies that were in there said, I have to leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5658.535s">What</a> do you mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5659.135s">I</a> was an employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5660.356s">I</a> have to leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5661.157s">I</a> have to go put money in the meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5662.718s">It</a> was just around lunchtime. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5663.859s">I</a> have to go put money in the meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5665.7s">She</a> goes out putting money in the meter, and she left the poor dentist in the shop with a lady sitting on the chair that she had to get another secretary to come in and help her out. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5676.22s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5678.222s">This</a> is not making any sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5680.163s">It's</a> a whole bunch of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5683.446s">No,</a> these people are coming forward, and what they're upset about is that they addressed this to the mayor's office with absolutely no response, and that's just plain rudeness, whether you agree to disagree to the whole nine yards. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5696.857s">I</a> just don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5699.219s">As</a> we continue to go, and here's the pictures of the parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5704.634s">against</a> the wall where Mystic Valley Pediatric Center, you have these two kiosks, and you have people parked almost 250 feet away who are basically coming here maybe for the first time, not even knowing what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5717.517s">We</a> do have a sighting section. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5719.258s">Again,</a> another violation of the contract on page 11. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5723.79s">It</a> says, operators' vehicles, the rear of all vehicles shall have a sign warning of frequent vehicle stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5732.016s">Here</a> we are again this week with the location, same truck, same vehicle, in the square, and no sign on the back making stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5743.304s">This</a> is a clear violation of the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5745.405s">We've</a> got it now three weeks in a row with pitches. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5748.627s">I</a> don't know what the mayor thinks that <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5750.089s">This</a> is great that he thinks this Republic company from Tennessee is doing a wonderful job, but I don't think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5755.452s">And</a> if you're starting to get people like this from Mystic Valley Pediatrics willing to come forward and use their names and they're not afraid of it because they're upset and they're really PO'd that the mayor would be disrespectful not even to respond, that's starting to tell the story and it's starting to escalate throughout this entire community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5771.839s">And</a> I would hope that anyone who has a concern about this keeps on bringing them in, keeps on expressing them. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5778.189s">You</a> know, how do you put your money into the machine, and how do you get the wrong number to come out? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5782.53s">And</a> I think it was a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday, somebody put money in the machine, and they got more money back than what they put in. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5790.392s">So</a> where's that meter at, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5800.435s">Well,</a> you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5803.257s">Whether</a> you're for it or against it, it's that one lady who wanted to do what she thought was the right thing to do—it's probably going on three weeks now—went to Medford Square, went to go put the money in the meter, fell on the bank, and got rushed to the emergency room in the Lawrence Memorial by ambulance because she didn't want to get the ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5819.85s">To</a> me, that, to me, is the whole story. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5822.432s">This</a> is more than the whole story, but this is just symptomatic as to what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5827.135s">Councilor</a> Caraviello, you said 60 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5828.977s">The</a> 60 days, I believe, is up. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5830.963s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5831.823s">I</a> don't know where the report is, but I can tell you this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5834.684s">I</a> know what I'm going to do once that 60 days comes in. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5837.504s">So,</a> apparently, they have no respect for the resolution of the Council ER request. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5841.945s">This</a> is now the 17th, and, you know, this isn't me talking. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5847.407s">This</a> is all information that can be backed up. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5849.427s">I</a> mean, it's there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5853.068s">What</a> can I tell you? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5855.515s">It's</a> anti-business, and if this is what Mayor McGlynn wants, to tax the people to death with another bogus tax the people, beside everything else, that's a damn shame. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5869.259s">Yeah,</a> my resolution is that, number one, I would like to have Councilor Caraviello's resolution of the first 60 days reported back as to revenues, and I think also, I think they need to come back and reappear before us, Republic, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5884.16s">As</a> to what all these inconsistencies and these happenings, I mean, how are they going to address them?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5898.614s">Yeah,</a> I got no problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5900.196s">And</a> also the fact that you have a violation of the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5902.825s">The</a> cars are still not properly identified, as the contract says it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5907.549s">Also,</a> I believe you have people that will call up and tell you that they're getting tickets for parking on permit streets that still haven't even been identified by Republic as being updated and corrected.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_EHumvCHQbJg/2025-03-21_EHumvCHQbJg.html">Medford City Council - March 10, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=81.22s">Mr.</a> President, um, I think during this past winter season, we've all seen, um, the problems that exist not only here in the city of Medford, but out throughout the entire Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=93.409s">And</a> as a result of that, and after speaking with the folks at the, uh, Massachusetts department of transportation and going online and reviewing some things across the country, as it relates to <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=105.038s">streets</a> and neighborhoods, sidewalks, curbs, and a whole host of things, where the money might be coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=115.422s">And</a> after noticing that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts just had this new identification program implemented, asking people on any state roadways, if you see something that's dangerous, please take a picture, send it in, and identify a particular location. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=131.188s">It</a> gave me the idea that here in the city of Medford, it doesn't take a genius to figure this out. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=135.611s">Just</a> drive down any street in the city of Medford and you have potholes all over the place and desperate need to be filled, you know, potential damage just waiting to happen on any car or truck that may be driving down the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=149.72s">But</a> that also leads to another host of issues as it relates to the good weather and the good times and how are we going to handle certain things such as <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=159.896s">Um,</a> viruses that seem to be emanating, um, from certain drains and soil systems, um, as the West Nile virus has presented itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=170.338s">Um,</a> the Commonwealth of Massachusetts ran a survey last year of the 351 cities and towns, um, for which 229 of them responded on a major road survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=183.181s">And</a> unfortunately, and I don't know why the city of Medford did not respond to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=187.965s">And</a> this was in regards to Chapter 90 roadway funds that could be used for local communities had they sent in a description of what their needs might be for Chapter 90 roadway needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=202.558s">And</a> it comes especially in light of the fact that this administration, Governor's administration, Charlie Baker, has made a commitment to Chapter 90 roadway funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=211.866s">But</a> unfortunately, where the city of Medford falls in this, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=216.114s">They</a> didn't do the survey, and the survey methodology wasn't complete. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=220.798s">It</a> was complete for 229 cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=224.56s">We</a> have here in the city of Medford a brand new building for which we are spending approximately $15 million for a new Department of Public Works building. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=232.987s">And</a> in that Department of Public Works building, it would be hoped that we would have the men, the equipment, and the wherewithal to handle all the things necessary to look at our streets here in the city of Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=246.084s">and</a> as we continue to go forward and into the future, making our city better than what it has been and what it could be. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=254.167s">As</a> a result of that, I'm going to be asking in a two-part layered program that if anybody out there, whether you're on your own street or you see a city street, private way, and you have a concern because of a pothole, take the picture of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=272.513s">Take</a> the picture of it, ID it, <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=274.653s">send</a> it in to the city clerk's office or the Department of Public Works, where you would at least get a, hopefully a system would be set up. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=286.179s">You</a> would get something that would be timed, dated and stamped and identified as to where the location might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=292.423s">This</a> could also be representative of if your street is in desperate need of repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=297.906s">This</a> is also in regards to when NSTAR and any other utility comes into the community, digs up a street, <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=304.36s">And</a> six months or a year after the fact, there's a big concave in the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=307.421s">There's</a> a hole in the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=308.882s">And</a> that hasn't been addressed, and it doesn't take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=311.242s">And</a> that turns out to be a hole in the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=315.084s">I</a> think when you're asking the taxpayers of this community to recognize $15 million is now being put into a new public works building, I think you should also be asking that issues such as this need to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=327.708s">And</a> they shouldn't be put on a burner saying, we don't have enough money to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=330.769s">We</a> don't have the equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=332.036s">or</a> we don't have the men to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=333.736s">I</a> think we need to stop looking at where we're going with this type of rehabilitation that's needed here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=341.358s">A</a> most recent law passed by the state legislature will now allow sewer systems and drainage systems to have lava sides be placed into their drainage systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=354.061s">Lava</a> sides would be something that will be able to address Westphalia <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=358.323s">West</a> Nile virus and any other potential that might be out there that has been out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=362.706s">In</a> the past, um, that has not been allowed because of, I believe the pesticide content that might be, have an environmental impact, but because of this inbreeding and the extension or the acceleration of, of West Nile virus and other, and other issues related to that, um, this year, um, department of public works, um, and city engineers, um, will be allowed to use lavisides into these particular locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=387.943s">We</a> have in excess of $6.5 million in free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=391.665s">I</a> would hope that approximately $1 million of that money would be used to get into this city restoration street program. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=400.23s">We</a> all know that some monies may not be all, but some monies will be coming back from the federal government because of these storms. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=407.134s">I</a> believe it's a two-phase application from MEMA. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=412.097s">And</a> as a result of that, I believe <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=414.99s">The</a> state administration feels comfortable approximately 35% of that, if not more, will be forthcoming on the first round, not knowing if they're going to accept the second round, having it to be identified as an emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=427.293s">And</a> hopefully it will be identified. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=429.034s">This</a> is the first time in many, many years the weather has done what it has to the Northeast region in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=434.735s">So</a> taking that into consideration and also recognizing that the new MS-4 permit that we talked about last week <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=441.19s">is</a> now a real bone of contention. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=443.672s">I</a> went to a meeting last week up on Beacon Hill, where the Mass Water Resource, not MWRA, the Mass Water Resource Association, which comprised about six individuals that deal with water and sewage and drainage and EPA requirements, are on board with this because they know that the cost, which is going to be anywhere from $800,000 plus per each community to implement an MS4 system, <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=469.568s">is</a> also going to have an impact on roadways and sidewalks and streets, curbings and machinery. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=476.03s">They're</a> asking not only for a delay to this, but they're also asking, as we had asked last week, our city engineer, to ask a pushback in an educational program for educating not only our community, but all the communities, of what this is going to entail and the cost impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=491.395s">We</a> know also on an annual basis that we have approximately a million dollars or thereabouts that comes back each and every year <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=498.723s">on</a> our budget because of expenditures that don't take place, excise tax revenues, and a whole host of other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=505.185s">So</a> I think our commitment should be upfront relative to doing the streets and the potholes and doing them correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=513.627s">There</a> are ways of doing it rather than just getting a shovel and taking it off the back of the truck and throwing it into a hole and let somebody drive over it, as compared to taking the time, putting it down, pounding it in, and making sure it's going to stay there for a reasonable period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=528.527s">Some</a> streets are going to just need to be done completely all over. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=531.47s">And</a> I think one of the things, and I think this council has addressed it on numerous occasions, we keep giving licenses to NSTAR for whether it's gas or electric, whatever the diggings of the streets might be up. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=542.077s">And</a> I believe we have a $10,000, I think that's it, Mr. Clark, isn't it a $10,000 bond that they have to put up? <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=547.521s">I</a> think we really need to start holding these accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=550.403s">I</a> believe the last time that one of the utilities came here, we asked that it go back in six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=555.687s">And</a> if not, we were going to take that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=557.57s">So</a> we have the mechanisms, we have the avenues to do this, but I think this not only bodes well for our community, I think it puts ourselves in the right direction, because all the streets in our city are in desperate need of repair, and some shape, manner, and form. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=571.019s">So</a> in essence, in a nutshell, it basically is asking any person in the community to go out there, whatever you see that you might think is a hazard, take the picture of it, or if you don't wanna take the picture and you can't, make a phone call, either to the clerk's office or the highway department, and hopefully they'll set up some kind of <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=587.223s">a</a> situation where you call on a particular day, you get a number, and that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=591.265s">It</a> goes to the highway department, and they start addressing that this spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=594.846s">It</a> would be a shame to have the city administration say, we don't either have the equipment or the personnel to handle this, because that's not what they voted for when they voted for a $15 million building to upgrade the Department of Public Works, who claimed, or the city claimed, hasn't been upgraded in years, and they were working in a substandard building. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=612.913s">We</a> need to understand that if we're going to be paying monies to upgrade buildings <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=617.288s">and</a> refurbish them or whatever we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=619.149s">We</a> need to have the equipment, the men and the tools to go with it, to handle what our city needs might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=623.891s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I move the question, ask for a roll call vote and welcome any opportunity for comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=630.774s">Thank</a> you, councilor.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=724.403s">That</a> a million dollars be taken out of free cash.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=962.518s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=965.08s">On</a> that matter, from my understanding, the first — Point of information, counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=969.443s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=969.823s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=970.824s">There</a> were four snowstorms that we're dealing with. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=972.626s">I</a> think what the state is trying to do is put the first three in together because of its closeness in time and calling that the major storm. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=979.941s">If,</a> in fact, that goes through, a larger portion of federal monies will come back to the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=984.743s">If</a> they take them separately or individually, it'll be a lesser portion, and each will have to be argued. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=989.845s">There</a> are two avenues. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=991.146s">You're</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=991.746s">One</a> is for snow, and one is for potholes. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=994.467s">It's</a> a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=995.187s">It's</a> the second priority on the agenda of the Baker administration, so I'm quite sure you're going to see something come out of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1000.57s">We'll</a> see some action. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1001.47s">Councilor</a> Marks.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1469.559s">Councilor</a> Naylor, maybe I'm confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1472.179s">Are</a> you talking about side streets or off main streets?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1505.873s">I've</a> got no problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1506.874s">I</a> think I'd like to just divide that into two parts. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1509.516s">The</a> first one, we've had construction companies and utility companies dig up our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1514.74s">And</a> if the cost has to be attributed to them, and maybe we should, again, getting back to, as compared to the legitimate cost of a city street, maybe just break it down in two ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1523.38s">That</a> which and how the city's been dug up, it's caused the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1526.783s">And</a> if it's a legitimate city street that we own outright with no other interference from an outside vendor, be it an instar or a contractor, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1534.29s">And</a> I think we'll get a better handle of what the true cost would be.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1568.885s">That's</a> part of the key. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1569.545s">And</a> the other part of the key is going back to a council of marks of literature, <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1572.45s">I</a> mean, if we're building this new building, and we don't have the equipment, and we don't have the men, or whatever it might be, we probably need to be looking at something that's going to cost us a few more dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1582.495s">And</a> that's what our free cash is for. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1584.316s">You</a> know, they have a special machine that's called a pothole pounder. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1587.338s">I</a> don't know if anyone's ever seen it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1588.859s">It</a> comes out of the Midwestern part of the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1590.96s">And</a> what they do is they go up and down the streets, and in the middle of the truck, where <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1597.583s">where</a> the hot tub is, it's hot, it goes into the ground, and then the pound, it just goes down, ba-boom, ba-boom, like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1603.166s">And</a> it's perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1604.246s">And</a> it goes ba-boom, ba-boom. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1606.788s">It</a> pounds itself right in. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1608.468s">And</a> it might cost a few thousand, $100,000, a couple of hundred thousand, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1612.91s">But</a> you're looking at the long-term effect of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1616.352s">And</a> that's what the whole thing is. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1617.813s">We're</a> not looking for 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1618.573s">Yeah,</a> right, we could borrow it to see how it works.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2051.215s">I'd</a> like to make a point of, just a point of correction. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2057.539s">I</a> believe in, and when I gave my comments regarding the street recovery program, it was the Mass Municipal Association that ran <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2065.146s">the</a> survey for the Commonwealth of Mass of the 229 cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2069.527s">I</a> may have missaid that wrong, but that's, that's who did it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2073.127s">So</a> I just want to let you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2074.848s">And</a> that's how they presented their chapter 90 budget because of the input that mass municipal gave to the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2079.789s">And</a> that's how they presented it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2081.189s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2623.977s">On</a> that subject matter, I believe it was one of the topics that was brought up today at the Traffic Commission meeting this afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2630.66s">I'm</a> going to make a request on these boards and these commission meetings, just as an aside. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2635.282s">There</a> are a lot of people who would have liked to have attended, but they can't go at 2 o'clock in the afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2639.453s">you</a> know, either that or televise it or what have you, but to have it in an afternoon and knowing how important of an issue this is, and now as it is escalating into another part of the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2652.301s">Also,</a> from last week to this week, once again, I happened to, again, have contact with people, especially in the West Method area, and I think they were the majority of the people at the meeting today, voicing not only their concerns but their objections to this whole kiosk program and how it's hurting their business. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2669.936s">Um,</a> and they can say whatever they want when the mayor makes the comment, he hasn't received one complaint. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2675.158s">Well,</a> they know that that's not true because either they've either called or they couldn't get through or that's nothing but good PR for what he wants to believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2684.02s">Um,</a> as of March 5th of this week, and once again, we have pitches of this wonderful Republic truck from Tennessee going out and according to page 11 of the contract, it states in <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2699.962s">Operator's</a> Vehicles Part B, the rear of all vehicles shall have a sign warning of frequent stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2705.446s">There's</a> no sign indicating frequent stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2710.209s">I</a> don't know, each and every week, this has been going on since January, what does it take for this company, more importantly, what does it take for this man to understand that this company from Tennessee is just not doing what it's supposed to be doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2721.856s">It's</a> not honoring the contract, and it's not working out to the best of abilities for everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2728.536s">Councilor</a> Marks, you asked, I think it was two weeks ago, when does 8-6 start? <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2733.28s">Has</a> anybody gotten that answer yet? <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2735.861s">They</a> passed it today. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2737.142s">So</a> 8-6 becomes effective when? <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2740.965s">So</a> if that's the case, then when does the three-hour parking in the municipal lots go up? <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2745.569s">And</a> when do all the signs that are bolted to the trees around the city, when do those things change? <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2751.873s">You</a> know, there's a whole host of issues that revolve around this, and I'm not so <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2756.371s">I'll</a> say it again, and as I said it before, I just think the whole thing is anti-business. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2759.954s">I</a> don't think it serves any purpose of doing anything to enhance business here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2766.04s">The</a> complaints are just too numerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2768.222s">One</a> lady in particular, unfortunately, two weeks ago or thereabouts, if not longer, falling down, trying to put money in a kiosk, getting rushed to a hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2776.309s">They</a> parking in front of meters and hydrants, they can violate the law and they have to be told not to. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2781.768s">And</a> once again, you're right, Gene, you have to tell the chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2783.829s">The</a> chief has to go and tell them. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2785.21s">These</a> people know what the rules are and whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2788.052s">And</a> I think we're getting pretty close to the point that I think I probably would be moving pretty soon that we just end this contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2794.936s">It'll</a> be the best approximately $900,000 this city could spend to get rid of this company and then stick your head to the grindstone and figure out an enforcement program that makes sense here in the city of Medford, hiring people on a part-time basis, <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2808.952s">And</a> I think people would acknowledge that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2810.672s">Or,</a> and the alternative, as Councilor Camuso, you alluded to it in the beginning, if they put meters out there in the beginning, people would have understood it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2817.674s">They</a> would understand seeing a meter, putting the money in the meter, and so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2820.695s">But</a> it's too discombobulated. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2822.235s">There</a> is no uniformity. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2824.255s">When</a> they thought they were going to make a clean killing on Playstead Road from people from Winchester parking all day there for $5 a day, <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2831.507s">There's</a> nobody there. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2832.267s">Not</a> one car. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2833.708s">There's</a> nobody there. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2834.949s">So</a> whatever they thought they were going to accomplish, they're not accomplishing. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2838.23s">And</a> changing from 7 to 7 to 8 to 6, it's 12 hours a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2842.032s">That's</a> 48 hours a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2844.213s">Think</a> about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2844.833s">I</a> mean, if I was Republican, I'd be running out of town and saying, hey, this isn't worth it for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2849.315s">And</a> that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2851.416s">So</a> that's my comment as an aside to what you folks talked about right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2856.219s">And</a> it's obvious. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2857.439s">Again,</a> the problems continue to exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2859.891s">with</a> the McGlynn Traffic Enforcement Program, it's just not working. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2863.892s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2864.892s">Councilor</a> Knight.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3216.659s">Quick.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3218.38s">You</a> just alluded to the word consensus, and I just want to highlight the fact that I thank you for bringing that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3224.364s">I</a> think the Mayor of Boston should be complimented. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3226.793s">for</a> him asking the citizens of Boston and anyone what their thoughts might be for the expansion or the upgrading of the City Hall Plaza down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3236.081s">And</a> that's just a great way to get people involved when you do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3240.224s">What</a> a shame that that doesn't take place in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3243.147s">And</a> this administration is so close-knit on everything that they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3246.329s">There's</a> been nothing that talks about, nothing that talks about complete community interaction. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3251.433s">So</a> I thank you for bringing that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3252.855s">And</a> I would hope, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3255.067s">Wouldn't</a> that be interesting if we put a budget item, a line item in the budget for community expansion by way of advertising. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3262.493s">So</a> when something comes up of a great magnitude, the people of this community, everyone will be notified in advance and they'll have a chance to participate rather than the clothes shop that apparently operates right now in a vacuum. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3275.144s">It's</a> a vacuum. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3276.105s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3276.446s">Councilor.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3598.075s">Quick</a> question. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3604.689s">Yes,</a> sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3605.649s">You</a> used the term, if we could do it and put it on Maiden Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3609.151s">What</a> is Maiden Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3610.271s">What</a> is that?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3967.351s">Well,</a> I would like to discuss the minutes of 224 if they're relative to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3971.854s">If</a> they're relative to something else, that's a different story.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_vNUWiKdVZmw/2025-03-21_vNUWiKdVZmw.html">Medford City Council - March 3, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1061.544s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1062.965s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1064.247s">Two</a> questions, John. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1065.068s">The</a> first one is, you said there's about a hundred members?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1086.081s">The</a> question I would have, where are they going to park their cars? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1088.702s">Where</a> are they going to park their cars? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1090.323s">Are</a> they going to infringe upon the neighborhood?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1134.976s">And</a> is this a reintroduction of the old Italian club that used to be on Up and South? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1138.438s">Pardon</a> me? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1138.918s">Is</a> this a reintroduction of the Italian club that used to be up on South Method? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1143.401s">No,</a> not at all.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1208.165s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1208.585s">If</a> that is all Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1209.985s">And</a> one last thing, John, uh, on your page that you have coming back from the department of revenue and the letter of compliance, I'm sorry, on the letter that came back from the department of revenue that was submitted, the indicate you have no withholding, no sales and no room occupancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1225.789s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1233.691s">But</a> in that pipe that you filed, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1235.658s">you're</a> not being responsible for withholding sales in room and room.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1240.301s">But</a> what are you going to do if, in fact, in the future you said you folks are going to be applying possibly for a liquor license? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1246.405s">Now,</a> somebody has to pay for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1248.706s">So</a> are the members going to pay for that?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1267.09s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1267.931s">If</a> you were to get a liquor license from the City and your members go there for an event, are they going to charge for the alcohol that they are going to be serving? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1276.097s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1276.618s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=1277.058s">Then</a> you would have to come back and reapply for a sales tax provision as far as that part goes.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3860.618s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3863.279s">This</a> is one of the very few times that I guess I'm lost for words because it's maybe Councilor Camuso, maybe you hit it right in the head. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3870.503s">The</a> fact of the matter is, I look at this as the evil empire of a disease that apparently has come into our community and it's been neglected. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3880.988s">And</a> it's roared its ugly head to such a point that this demon of a disease now <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3888.307s">has</a> brought folks who are dealing with this on a daily basis to the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3895.292s">And</a> I think we all are. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3896.953s">I'll</a> speak for myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3899.714s">In</a> the family, yes, there is. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3901.356s">So</a> I'll just leave it at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3903.137s">I</a> have an understanding as to what's being said. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3906.479s">But</a> my opinion would be this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3909.361s">I</a> think the city needs to make a full-fledged financial, educational, and social, and a budgetary commitment <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3916.587s">that</a> if we're really going to be serious, we're going to take this right down to the lowest level of education, starting with the kids who are in nursery school, not nursery, what's the next level? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3925.956s">First</a> grade, and all the way up, and let them understand the danger of what this disease is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3932.883s">You</a> know, Councilor Caraviello talked about his friend, 61 years old, Councilor Camuso, his age just a little bit younger. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3939.317s">There's</a> other folks even younger, and there are adults, mothers and fathers who sometimes become addicted. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3945.323s">For</a> why it happens, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3948.506s">But</a> if this city has the good fortune to go out of its way to raise over a million dollars for a brand new peace garden, they can go out of its way to find the necessary tools to have a budget appropriation that's going to deal with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3964.76s">as</a> part of the medical justification why the city of Medford does care about its inhabitants, its students, its families, its mothers, its fathers, and anyone who might have an addiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3976.83s">I</a> think tonight is a big wake-up call for this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3980.052s">For</a> the folks that came up there and spoke, was it hard to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3983.495s">It</a> certainly was hard, but I think you're really relieved that you came up here and said it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3988.075s">because</a> you've now got the entire council, I'll leave Councilor De La Ruza to himself, you've got at least six councilors speaking right now, and I think we're all in your court. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=3997.923s">New</a> Governor Baker, his second commitment was the opiate problem here in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4004.348s">So</a> right from the governor's office all the way down, there is going to be nexus as to how this city and where this city should be going. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4011.493s">I</a> not only concur with you, Councilor Marks, I just think it's, you know, it's been laid under the rug for so long <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4018.503s">And</a> how do you say it other than the fact, you know, enough is enough? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4024.086s">The</a> police department, I'm quite sure, can come up here and tell you case after case, story after story, arrest after arrest. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4030.509s">It</a> does have an impact in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4032.891s">And</a> why should anybody be afraid to say that particular house or that particular part of the city, you know, there's drugs over there more than another part. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4039.514s">There</a> should be no drugs at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4041.627s">There</a> should be no drugs at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4042.968s">And</a> to get to no drugs at all, friends like Janelle, if you know someone that's on it, you've got to just turn them in and that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4050.054s">It's</a> the only way you're going to save their life because no one else is either going to do it or they want to get involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4056.178s">You</a> know, we're seven adults here behind this rail. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4059.921s">And</a> I'm quite sure they will all agree on this one here. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4062.383s">Do</a> we want to see this continue on? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4063.804s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4064.004s">Do</a> we want to see it corrected? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4065.245s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4066.326s">And</a> the first step is, as Councilman Marks has his resolution going forward, but I honestly think it should be <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4071.791s">stepped</a> up even further. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4073.272s">I</a> think a dollar amount should be put into the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4075.393s">I</a> think there should be a social, educational, and a financial commitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4082.616s">And</a> you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4083.216s">The</a> newspaper is here right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4085.437s">And</a> I'd like to have the newspaper report and make this its headline story as it relates to the Medford City Council recognizes the drug problem in the city of Medford, and they're going to demand from the city administration that action takes place <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4097.273s">to</a> protect those that are either in the program or having drugs, and to protect the families that have children, unfortunately, who are addicted to this, because they need help just as much as the person that's addicted in the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4110.581s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I would hope that you, as leader of our council, conclude by offering not only your support to Councilor Marks' resolution, but let's have the folks walk out of this audience here tonight and recognize they came here <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4123.862s">with</a> a true and honest and a just purpose, and they did get results tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4128.325s">They</a> didn't get lip service, they didn't get a press conference, and I thank you for Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4132.408s">You</a> did bring that up a few weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4134.25s">The</a> mayor tried a jump shot, but he didn't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4136.572s">You</a> beat him to the punch because you were legitimate. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4138.673s">The</a> issue was legitimate, and that's where it belongs. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4141.215s">It</a> has a smack of legitimacy that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4144.438s">It's</a> not a phony, come on. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4145.959s">It's</a> a true reality in life here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4148.721s">And</a> if drugs are out there, then the first thing to do is you have to recognize it, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4153.265s">Address</a> it and work to get rid of it slowly. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4156.047s">And</a> the only way you're going to do that is you're going to have to bring it to the attention of every single person, and starting with just your children at the youngest of age, to let them know that this is not good for their health, their mind, their body, and their spirit. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4167.855s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4832.501s">A</a> question. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4832.861s">I</a> want to go back to Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4834.702s">You</a> talked about the D.A. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4835.603s">program.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4835.823s">Where</a> did you want the D.A. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4836.644s">program</a> to go? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4837.564s">Every</a> school. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4838.905s">Starting</a> from kindergarten up?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5435.256s">I</a> believe also, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5442.16s">Over</a> and beyond the moving violation, there's another one in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5446.302s">Unpaid</a> parking tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5448.764s">What</a> about them?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5477.581s">Sir,</a> you made your application out on December 4th of 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5481.203s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5481.463s">And</a> the question was asked, do you owe money for any parking fines? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5486.186s">And</a> the answer is yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5488.227s">And</a> do you owe money for parking tickets? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5489.788s">And</a> the answer is yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5491.91s">I</a> don't owe. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5494.391s">No,</a> but he's trying to, this was in December. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5497.573s">You</a> haven't paid since December. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5499.574s">This</a> is now March. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5502.87s">And</a> what is the traffic violation for?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5541.805s">Did</a> you pay that fine?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5556.399s">Which</a> city was that, sir?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5561.761s">So</a> you made your appeal to the city of Boston? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5563.502s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5564.002s">Did</a> you have your hearing? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5565.563s">Please?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5566.023s">Did</a> you have your hearing? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5567.224s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5569.245s">Next</a> week?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5570.745s">Next</a> week.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5576.828s">And</a> what about the parking tickets? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5577.929s">What</a> about those? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5579.329s">How</a> many parking tickets do you have? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5586.251s">I</a> think I have two. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5587.892s">Mr.</a> Chairman, before the license is granted, tickets, and if he's going next week for the hearing, can we hold that off until we get the results?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5833.247s">The</a> Corey check is basically for criminal background check. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5835.507s">It's</a> not for licenses and it's not for a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5838.468s">So</a> what the chief is saying is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5840.828s">And</a> I think, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5841.628s">as</a> a city clerk has questioned seven and eight strike that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5846.509s">Well,</a> six really wouldn't come up under the query, but seven and eight definitely would not come up under the query. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5852.11s">And</a> I think those need to be, uh, as council max alluded to, I think they need to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5856.21s">And</a> I agree with council Caraviello, um, to hold us in the dance until both of these are resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5861.631s">But</a> don't forget this application was made getting everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5865.672s">The</a> chief responded on February 19th and this fellow made his application on January 16th. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5873.448s">This</a> is what I don't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5875.449s">He</a> filed on January 16th, 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5878.149s">The</a> last fellow that was up here put his application on December 4th, 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5884.831s">Why</a> is there such a spread in time before these things get approved?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5894.533s">No,</a> December 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5895.833s">December</a> 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5897.154s">The</a> last gentleman applied December 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5899.914s">This</a> gentleman applied January 16th.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5958.799s">I</a> understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5959.439s">But</a> I don't understand the, both of them came back at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=5962.65s">to</a> be presented before the council, and there's almost a month and a half spread between both applicants.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6037.567s">A</a> vote of five in the affirmative, two in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6039.828s">Let</a> the record reflect the reason why I, and I believe my council colleague, voted no was because of the impending review of the traffic law, I mean the tax.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6248.477s">When</a> was that supposed to become effective? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6251.418s">Because</a> that's the calls I'm getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6253.339s">When</a> does the 8 to 6 become effective?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6488.802s">Councilor</a> Penta real quick on the convenience fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6490.723s">I</a> think it was, um, uh, mighty Walsh, the mayor of Boston who was trying to, um, and I believe they have the same system that we have there. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6498.149s">They're</a> negotiating for 12 and a half cents. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6499.811s">I</a> believe rather than 35 cents that's presently out there, but that's neither here or there. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6504.767s">I</a> believe we're dating back to January 16th of this past year. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6507.988s">One</a> of the members on the commission, um, Mrs. DeLorenzo, I, you know, I think it was subsequent to the council's request to change this to eight to six. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6517.39s">And</a> that was sent to, um, uh, council, you know, Mr. Rumbly on February 3rd, a solicitor did render an opinion and he did run her opinion basically saying that it falls within the purview of the traffic commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6529.192s">But</a> he makes a very interesting note on the second page of his, of his opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6533.663s">He</a> states, as to the effect of the regulatory rate changes on the contract, quote, substantial change, that impedes or enhances enforcement may result in a negative or positive impact on percentage payments that may be due under the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6550.294s">The</a> same is true for substantial reduction or increase on parking spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6555.157s">So,</a> and I believe, again, the argument that was brought up, or our issue was brought up in discussion, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6562.688s">And</a> that from 7 to 7, you're going from 8 to 6. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6565.79s">That's</a> a substantial change in the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6567.771s">And</a> I believe it was you, Councilor Caraviello, I believe, who asked for the review after the first 60 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6574.934s">And</a> within that 60 days, we're going to have an idea just where they're going, what revenues or lack thereof with the change of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6582.058s">And</a> if they consider this to be a substantial change in the contract, this is going to have to be reviewed a step further. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6588.161s">I'd</a> like to just bring one other attention to this whole issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6591.462s">During</a> this past week, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6594.419s">I</a> received the following points of concern from residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6598.902s">There</a> is a lady who walked in Medford square in the CVS and she went to go put the money in the meter and she fell down and she had to be rushed to the Lawrence Memorial Hospital because of, because of just trying to get to the meter where the snow bank was. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6613.493s">Also</a> in an area that we were told that Republic was going to be apprised as to what's going on, I believe during the past two weeks, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6622.777s">There</a> was a funeral that took place at St. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6624.978s">Joseph's</a> Church on High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6627.519s">And</a> when the folks came out that went to the funeral mass, their cars were all ticketed and tagged. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6633.281s">And</a> apparently the good father over there had to go down to the police department or Republic to get that resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6640.923s">The</a> subsequent concern that came out of that, because they do operate on a Saturday, the priest's concern was, what if there's a wedding? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6649.747s">Are</a> those people going to be tagged? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6651.366s">that</a> go to church on Saturday on a wedding. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6653.807s">And</a> I believe we were told by the Republic that once they knew what was going on, none of these people would be tagged. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6659.851s">And</a> here it is, they just got tagged two weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6662.633s">And</a> then during this past Sunday, in the bulletin of the church, there is a notation as it relates to the collaboration of the churches between St. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6672.959s">Joseph's</a> and St. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6673.699s">Francis.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6674.82s">And</a> because of the collaboration, they're going to use alternate dates, especially for the Feast <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6681.17s">Easter,</a> but he indicates over here, we plan and underscore that the fact that we are now in a collaborative, but we also need to work around each parish's schedule and as well as the parking meter times that have become an issue of late. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6696.657s">Now,</a> we were told that this was not going to be a problem for the churches and for them to put it into the bulletin, having not only a problem already exist, it's obvious that Republic just has not gotten the message. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6709.724s">Once</a> again, last week I introduced pictures of Republic driving down the street, not having properly marked notices on their car, supposed to be in the back. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6719.03s">All</a> they had was, all they have now was just a P on the door. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6722.132s">There's</a> no telephone number, there's no identification of who they are or what they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6725.815s">So</a> I really think there are some serious infractions in this particular contract that they have here with the city of Medford.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6744.703s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6745.644s">I</a> have not seen anything there yet either. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6747.445s">So</a> why? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6748.606s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6749.226s">But</a> the fact of the matter is now, I think it's now been bumped up and escalated. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6753.229s">If</a> you have one of the churches in our community expressing not only a problem, not only a problem with a funeral, potential problem for a wedding, and now putting it in the bulletin that addresses a community of over 9,700 people, which make up the parish of St. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6768.258s">Joe's,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6769.705s">and</a> relative to the meat is becoming an issue, the lady falling down in Medford Square having to be taken by an ambulance. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6776.047s">I</a> just really think that this program really is not business friendly, it's not friendly to the community, and hopefully Councilor Caraviello, when the 60 days are up, we will have numbers to work on, and as far as I'm concerned, I would make a determination that we opt out of this whole program. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6795.374s">It'll</a> be the best money the city ever paid, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6797.628s">and</a> bring a city back to some sense of normalcy. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6800.709s">Thank</a> you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6801.509s">Councilor</a> Caraviello.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6920.218s">I</a> would like to have my resolution on there also to, I mean, my amendment to that as it relates to the churches. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6925.219s">So</a> whether it's for a funeral and now for a wedding during the hours that they said that they weren't going to, uh, you know, and it's, it's obvious, you know, for them to put it in the bulletin, it's, it's presented itself as a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6936.562s">Also,</a> Mr. President, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6938.264s">We</a> were also told that at the parking commission, maybe three, four weeks ago, that all the city's parking lots would be three hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6949.23s">Nothing</a> has been changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6950.691s">No</a> signage has been changed to three hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6954.013s">And</a> you still have signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6955.474s">You</a> can go down Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6956.594s">Signs</a> are bolted to the trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6958.075s">It's</a> ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6962.338s">This</a> company is just not doing what it's supposed to be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6965.239s">It's</a> quite obvious that the mayor doesn't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6967.148s">He</a> just signs a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6968.129s">He</a> really doesn't care what the impact is, and it's obvious. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6970.771s">But</a> I just really think that there is something wrong with how this whole operation is basically taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6977.355s">I</a> had a lady turn around and tell me, I believe on Governor's Avenue, they changed, by Carlene's over there, they changed the two hours to a 30-minute parking spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6985.481s">The</a> Traffic Commission approved it in their minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6988.498s">A</a> lady went out there, and the guy was coming around the street and was going to give her a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6992.019s">I</a> said, what are you doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6992.779s">She's</a> only been in. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6993.46s">She's</a> only inside for 10 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6995.78s">No,</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6996.64s">Don't</a> tell me. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6997.221s">I</a> mean, I'm watching. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6998.141s">I'm</a> right there with her. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7000.182s">So</a> how do they make this arbitrary decision of who's going to be there if there's no way to determine it?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7114.739s">If</a> we could, Councilor Pater. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7116.339s">On</a> the same thing, what Councilor Camuso just alluded to, whether it's 15 minutes or 30 minutes, you have spots in the city that's an hour or two hours, and there's no kiosks or anything there. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7123.901s">So</a> how do they make these judgmental calls by going down there and, you know, they're going to take the time and write every number down? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7130.102s">You</a> know, I saw something interesting the other... It's all in the sky. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7133.043s">Yeah,</a> I saw something interesting the other day. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7135.567s">I</a> was on Boston Avenue in the morning, and we saw the car going down the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7141.249s">He</a> was going down, how can you say, going towards Somerville on Boston Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7147.151s">He</a> was probably going down there to check out the people, and all of a sudden, he must have got a call, and he whipped his rear around, and he blew through that intersection at least 40, Councilman Marks was there, 40 to 50 miles an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7158.135s">He</a> gave no credit, because going right back to what you said, they probably got a buzzer that went off, that the person in the two hours was already over and beyond, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7166.397s">This</a> makes no sense how they run this operation that there was no consistency and you know How do you give out a ticket to someone when it's not even? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7173.863s">When</a> it's a snow emergency these people should know what's going on They should read the newspaper or they should be tied into the weather report that talks about a snow emergency in the city It's just unfair On the motion of Councilor Marks as amended all those in favor.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7598.394s">Mr.</a> President, I have a whole folder here on this whole idea of this MS-4. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7603.156s">This</a> has been around for maybe the last couple of years or thereabouts, maybe 2011 when it first came up. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7610.199s">This</a> mandate would put an absolute tremendous cost upon the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7616.002s">And</a> as a result of that, especially as the whole resolution recites itself, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7622.134s">They're</a> giving no help, no assistance. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7624.375s">You're</a> on your own. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7625.856s">Whether</a> the city of Medford, again, whether they want to join a coalition or not, it would be up to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7631.2s">But</a> I just think an $800,000, $900,000 hit on an annual basis for every one of the cities and towns to have to be looking at this right now, especially when we have unfunded retirement benefits that need to be paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7644.969s">Just</a> as tonight, just looking at the problem with the drugs and that's impact here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7651.412s">But</a> this is something I really think that the city of Medford needs to do, as other cities and towns are beginning to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7658.457s">Send</a> letters to the EPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7661.519s">And</a> they have an address in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7664.721s">It's</a> 5 Boston Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7666.923s">But</a> I also think that our federal state representatives, Catherine Clark, and Markey, and Warren, need to be on board with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7676.329s">They're</a> the first ones out there saying, oh, we've got to help the people and stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7680.825s">You</a> can't help the people by giving unfunded mandates such as this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7683.627s">Absolutely,</a> totally unfunded. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7685.848s">And</a> they have taken grants away that normally could have been used or would have been used for things such as this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7691.231s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I have no problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7694.653s">It</a> probably would be even more helpful if our city engineer was on board with this or our Department of Public Works. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7701.717s">But</a> I think at the outset, as a legislative body, as these other 85 cities and towns are doing, they're sending in these letters. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7708.461s">And</a> basically, you're just asking them <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7710.242s">to</a> delay it until you're ready to put a practical program in place that cities and towns can take a look at and can see. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7717.588s">The</a> way this thing is set up right now, if you have a street sweeper that goes down the street, you can't even have that street sweeper anywhere near a gutter because of what it's going to be able to go in there, because that's part of the stormwater drain. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7729.437s">So</a> there's a whole host of things that are implied with this, like I said. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7734.901s">This</a> has been going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7736.282s">I</a> have all this stuff here. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7737.868s">Uh,</a> but this is really, that's the issue of the resolution is, is the gut of the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7742.269s">And,</a> um, the point person, uh, well, the point person for the city would be the city engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7747.63s">Cause</a> they're, and, and, uh, Paul gear, who happens to be the director of public works, but it's, it's an issue that the city just cannot handle. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7755.611s">They</a> don't have the personnel and they don't have the expertise. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7758.812s">Um,</a> they may be expertise enough to understand what needs to be done, but we don't have the tools to implement this thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7764.833s">And</a> we don't have any resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7766.395s">that</a> the federal government are now imposing upon cities and towns, where the federal government should be having these workshops, should be having cities and towns go there to understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7776.158s">And</a> when you get your notice of intent permit, have it in more of a reasonable way, not 90 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7781.34s">And</a> then you have to have the whole program complete within a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7783.721s">It's</a> a cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7785.097s">It's</a> huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7785.618s">It's</a> 900,000 or thereabouts.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7793.463s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7794.244s">So</a> I have no problem to take the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7798.547s">We</a> can work with it, add or subtract to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7800.708s">But</a> the EPA is in Boston at 5 Post Office Square in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7805.391s">And</a> I believe that they are and they will accept comments as it relates to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7812.236s">And</a> I believe the more comments they get, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7814.138s">They'll</a> have an understanding that we can't go forward with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7816.759s">But</a> I think it's also beneficial, again, that our federal delegation becomes on board with this, too, because they can say, well, it needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7826.122s">A</a> lot of things need to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7827.922s">But</a> we've had so many unfunded mandates. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7829.923s">Leave</a> No Child Behind is one, which is an educational mandate. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7833.364s">But</a> this is something that's really huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7835.264s">And</a> this isn't just a one-shot deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7836.865s">This</a> is every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7837.725s">You're</a> going to have to deal with this thing every single year. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7839.686s">And</a> you're going to have to buy the equipment and the tools and everything that goes with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7844.31s">I'd</a> like to, um, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7846.592s">What</a> do you want to do with it? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7847.632s">I,</a> I would just like to send the letter off to the EPA and then just refer it upstairs and hopefully that the city administration does what they're supposed to do.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7861.182s">You</a> could do that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7870.057s">So</a> if we could, uh, legislative bodies, administrative and legislative bodies, we have a mayor, other cities and towns have city managers, but they have been soliciting, um, commentaries from legislative bodies, which is councils as well as the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7885.327s">So</a> it just adds to the impact of recognizing that there is a cost involved in getting to that cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7891.33s">There's</a> just no preparation. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7892.931s">It's</a> onto the cities and towns.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7935.167s">Mr.</a> President, the Watershed Association has nothing to do with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7939.49s">This</a> is an EPA mandate as it relates to our wastewater disposal and how it's going through, and whether it's through the – just how it's leaving the city, or all cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7953.357s">And</a> this is something where 85 cities and towns <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7955.77s">have</a> now, either through a coalition or independently, are asking the federal government to put a hold on this and waiting until appropriate federal funding is available to ensure that these requirements don't translate into a financial burden. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7968.779s">There's</a> no workshops being held up on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7972.102s">I'm</a> quite sure that our city engineer is aware of this, but like I said, this is now coming through after meeting and having this discussion and reviewing what <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7985.023s">85</a> cities and towns are now doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7986.304s">So</a> it's just, you know, we're not going to be novel on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7989.845s">This</a> is a direct approach of an unfunded mandate from the federal government.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8003.889s">So</a> on that motion and or the city council can take its own independent action after whatever she does.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8056.823s">Counsel</a> Penton? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8057.823s">In</a> June of 2014, Mr. Sano had his name placed in nomination for Retailer of the Year after he received the award of the Greater Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8066.844s">And</a> the competition to become the Realtor of the Year <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8070.452s">put</a> him into 15 real estate associations, and in competition with 20,000 individuals whose name came up for review for the particular purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8081.755s">If</a> anybody does know Mr. Sano, he works at Remax in Medford Square, Remax Andrew Realty. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8087.976s">He's</a> completely dedicated not only to his job, to his family, but the whole idea of being a professional in this particular job. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8097.098s">And</a> I believe anyone that knows him, especially in that office, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8100.8s">They</a> will tell you on a daily basis he lives, sleeps, and eats, being a good real estate person for whoever his client might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8112.086s">Also,</a> he's also well known in the regional area of realtors and the greater Boston leadership because of commitment to doing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8121.51s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to have Mr. Sano come before the council, receive the award, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8128.131s">for</a> which was given out, I believe, this past December by the vice president of, I guess, the State of the Professional Awards reception this past December. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8139.136s">And</a> it would be nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8139.956s">You</a> know, we seem to be blessed having certain business folks in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8145.378s">You</a> know, most recently we just had Dr. Lepore receive a piece of legislation that was passed long overdue as it relates to <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8153.588s">wind</a> instruments and helping to protect people not to get any diseases from using it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8158.389s">We</a> have Victor Garrow, who made national acclaim by defending a person for 30 years and bringing justice to someone not being found guilty for a crime that he didn't commit. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8168.252s">And</a> here we have now a local realtor here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8171.413s">We</a> have three people from three different walks of life, and I just think folks like that need to be recognized. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8178.469s">and</a> let people know that in our city of Medford, there are many citizens of the year, and they come from many walks of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8185.554s">So</a> that being said, I'd like to have Mr. Clark, we can get in touch with Mr. Sano and have him come to a future council meeting.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8417.815s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8419.616s">In</a> that packet, we received a letter from the mayor <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8422.39s">uh,</a> dated February 27th, as it relates to the, uh, um, the GIC situation that we discussed last week in the letter, um, they may have make some mistake on the right in the beginning, uh, plan design rest for GIC. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8435.998s">There</a> will be a voting on the rates on their upcoming March 3rd meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8439.861s">It</a> isn't March 3rd, it's tomorrow, March 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8442.743s">And</a> for those who might be interested in this March 4th meeting, which is tomorrow, and I believe it's at eight 15 or between eight 15, eight 30, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8451.101s">You</a> can attend the meeting, but they're not going to allow public comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8454.383s">So</a> that unfortunately seems to set another tempo here. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8458.524s">Also</a> in the letter, basically substantiates, I think, what we discussed last week, at least what I said. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8465.327s">The</a> unfortunate part of the GIC program, it's been intentionally underfunded for the past three years, and they never took it into any consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8473.65s">And</a> when they were doing their budgetary process, the prior administration, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8478.523s">They</a> never took into consideration the additional people who were joining GIC and that the end of federal funds were not being forthcoming to the Commonwealth of Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8491.688s">So</a> the cost of approximately $162 to $197 million is the cost right now, unfortunately, that GIC is going to be held accountable for to make whole this whole idea of those cities and towns that are in the GIC program. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8507.473s">Another</a> thing, another major change that they have made, it's going to go from an annual January to December to a fiscal year, which will be July 1st to June 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8516.88s">And</a> one of the keys in here is as follows, and I think it just segues itself into what we talked about last week, which is the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8526.466s">It</a> states, the GIC members can only change from an individual to a family or a family to an individual coverage with the qualifying event, which is marriage, birth, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8536.647s">adoption</a> of a child, change in the dependent eligibility, divorce, pursuant to subject matter chapter 32A, eligibility requirement, death of a spouse, dependent or a spouse, or dependence and voluntary loss of coverage elsewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8551.974s">Now,</a> by having that, that one-time event, and coupling that with Harvard Health and Tufts going from a PPO to a POS, the next part that seems to be an unqualified issue <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8565.605s">is</a> the fact that anyone who's in PPO and goes to a POS, whether it be in Tufts or Harvard, if you have a particular doctor in a particular hospital that are not in it, you cannot go to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8577.69s">You</a> lose that doctor. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8578.931s">You</a> lose that hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8580.731s">So</a> what was said before is, while the 85-15 might stay the same, there is a huge, there will be a 6% to 12% increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8591.376s">That's</a> what it looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8592.696s">The</a> projection is going to be <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8594.527s">at</a> tomorrow's event for them to take the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8598.769s">This</a> administration, the Baker administration, I believe, is committed to offsetting by a supplemental budget, getting close to that $192 million, which appears to be the magic number right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8611.556s">But</a> also, with that being said, the issue of whether, in fact, monies are going to be forthcoming in the future as it relates to offsetting that, that's going to be another issue unto itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8624.613s">I</a> think what needs to take place, and if I understand the gentleman who came here last week and indicated we're locked in until 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8632.474s">Now,</a> the only thing that we're locked into is the percentage rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8636.035s">We're</a> not locked into keeping the rates what they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8639.736s">The</a> city of Medford, as well as each subscriber, is going to have to wind up paying for this in some shape, manner, or form. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8646.697s">So</a> if you're a current employee, you're a retiree, a survivor, a school teacher, a policeman, a fireman, a municipal employee, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8654.743s">are</a> going to pay for this effective July 1st with the rates that will be forthcoming. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8660.665s">One</a> of the things that were brought up in discussion, and it was a point made really applicable by the Mass Teachers Association and the American Teachers Association, and their claim is quite candid, that they honestly feel that this whole health care cost, which is an outrageous cost, is being driven by insurance companies because <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8682.295s">The</a> driving of these rates are going up because of the claims. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8686.856s">And</a> the claims are being predicated by people going to more expensive either hospitals or more expensive doctors. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8692.537s">Now,</a> when the program and the problem was being introduced, strike that, when the whole insurance issue was being introduced, I believe in 2011, for which the city of Medford jumped on board, effective July, January 1st of 2012, the whole idea was to reduce our insurance cost here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8710.761s">Let's</a> just talk about the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8713.272s">And</a> that would have worked very well, and I think everybody recognized the fact that their co-pays and their family costs were going to go up as part of joining this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8721.235s">But</a> the city of Medford indicated that they would be saving approximately $25 to $26 million over a four-and-a-half, five-year period of time.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8731.24s">No,</a> this is the presentation of today, attending the meeting that the governor was at, and we had this discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8738.202s">You</a> don't mind, do you? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8738.923s">It's</a> information that is forthcoming. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8740.764s">And</a> as a result of that, <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8742.175s">This</a> information is very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8743.717s">So</a> anyone who was on GIC here in the city of Medford, Unicare, that seems to be the difference between Tufts Health and what's the other one? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8754.812s">I</a> just forgot it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8758.776s">And</a> what is the other one? <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8760.637s">I</a> just forgot the other name. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8762.338s">Well,</a> anyway, Harvard Health, Tufts Health and Harvard Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8764.94s">So</a> the tradeoff is going to be your fees and costs are going to be higher in Tufts Health and Harvard Health, but Unicare may be at an issue where they might either be the same or they may go down. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8777.41s">But</a> the real major concern is anyone who has their PPO is going to go to a POS, you are going to lose <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8784.777s">If</a> you lose your doctor or the hospital associated with it that you had before, and the PPO, and it's not found in the POS, then you cannot go to that doctor. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8793.138s">You're</a> going to have to find another doctor in another hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8795.539s">So</a> these are one of the diminishing things that are taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8798.459s">And</a> now we're up to 60 communities, 60 communities that seem to be ready to jump on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8803.94s">We</a> were at 50 at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8805.08s">Now</a> we're up to 60 cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8807.141s">And</a> again, the argument is the larger the numbers, the lower the cost should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8810.741s">But</a> it's not working out that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8812.442s">And</a> one of the big stumbling blocks <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8814.299s">The</a> Patrick administration, for three years in a row, underfunded intentionally the liability that was necessary to be paid in that GIC program. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8823.843s">And</a> that's where we're at right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8825.704s">So</a> what started off as a $320 million deficit, when the Patrick administration said they were passing a budget that's current and it's level, it's now up to, I think, almost $900 million, a shade under a billion dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8839.93s">And</a> these are one of the areas, unfortunately, that are being taxed. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8844.058s">Hopefully,</a> the mayor who was the negotiator in behalf of this can recognize the wherewithal to do something that offsets before 2017 no further increases that we would have to pay here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8858.226s">I</a> don't know what the relationship is between Harvard and Pilgrim with employees, retirees, and survivors as compared to Unicare, but that does and that will have an effect upon the city of Medford.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=173.024s">Mr.</a> President, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=176.229s">This</a> has really been a tough week, as we all know, between the snow and everything else.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=211.023s">I</a> was just making a preemptory comment.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=214.445s">I</a> see the chief here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=215.686s">Chief,</a> is he here? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=217.887s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=218.267s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=218.747s">No,</a> um, I have no, uh, chief, uh, this is my resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=223.43s">As</a> you know, that it's on the agenda for this evening, but in no way do I want that to interfere with any comments that you might be having as it relates to the paid a parking program. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=231.594s">So,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=233.054s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=233.294s">So</a> with that being said, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=235.187s">I</a> have no problem laying it on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=237.148s">You</a> want to wait for Councilor Caraviello, because I really don't know when Councilor Camus is coming back, how serious he is, sick or what.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=484.87s">Another</a> question. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=485.651s">Um,</a> um, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=490.351s">I'm</a> trying to get the visualization. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=491.611s">Is</a> this on the side of the street where Colleen's is on? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=494.452s">Is</a> that the hole? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=495.292s">The</a> hole that was there?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=496.772s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=497.472s">If</a> I remember correctly, too, on that particular hole that continuously started to sink, it was getting larger and larger. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=503.134s">And</a> the unfortunate part about it, I know some business merchants had called up until it almost actually caved in. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=509.255s">And</a> that's the place some months earlier, many months earlier, I believe the MWRA was there as they were addressing a water leak on that particular part of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=519.568s">I</a> believe, on a connection, and it was filled in. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=522.19s">And</a> I think on this one here, I think, if I remember correctly, it's where the sinkhole is going next to the curb, but it was right by the curb, and it just kept sinking, and it kept going in and in and in. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=535.379s">So</a> maybe the better issue is you can get back to us when it was done, but just how fragile is that particular? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=545.466s">A</a> lot of work has been done in that area over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=547.999s">And</a> maybe if we can get just an update from DPW, if we can add to the resolution.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=554.464s">Yeah,</a> to check that into the fragility. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=556.806s">Is</a> that such a word? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=557.586s">Yeah,</a> I think it's fragility.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=560.188s">The</a> fragility of the ground and the land in that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=563.631s">Thank</a> you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=564.391s">Councilor</a> Long-Beaucourt.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=627.734s">I</a> like to, um, can we just move the consideration of the paper we laid in the table? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=633.019s">I</a> just like to bring that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=633.819s">I</a> want to do something different with it on the paper.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=652.64s">Mr.</a> President, I'm going to, I'd like to move that the paper be withdrawn. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=656.06s">And</a> what I'll do is I'll just introduce it next week as a separate resolution on the motion that this paper be withdrawn by a Councilor Penta.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=704.853s">Mr.</a> President, we all know that when this new implementation took place, going to a tiered rate system, there was some pushback as it relates to the tier 1, 2, and 3 setup that originally started off at 0 to 800 <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=722.149s">cubic</a> feet, 801 cubic feet to 1,600 cubic feet, and then from 1,600 cubic feet and up. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=728.273s">And</a> there was a lot of concern that was, I believe, expressed here at the council meeting, and also, likewise expressed, I think, to the Water and Sewer Rate Commissioners. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=737.579s">But</a> through their staff, led by Ron Baker, who was in charge, and he is, I believe, he's the operations supervisor over this, the request was made not only by the council, but to the commission that maybe we should just look at <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=751.535s">on</a> a percentage basis, just where are we going on this tiered rate system because, in essence, it did turn out to be a water rate increase for certain members. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=763.165s">Most</a> recently, at the last Water and Sewer Commission, there was an adjustment that did take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=769.971s">I</a> had made the suggestion that we should look at the first billing that goes out and just see how many people fall within that 0 to 800. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=777.499s">Because</a> at that point in time when they did it, it was an estimation of the same thing with tier 2 and the same thing with tier 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=784.481s">They've</a> now gone into a revised tier system, which now puts you into the tier 1 system up to the first 1,000 cubic feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=794.644s">And</a> tier 2 goes from 1,000 to 2,000, and tier 3 goes from 2,000 and up, which is a significant, not large, but it's a significant increase <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=807.623s">as</a> it relates to giving homeowners an opportunity to receive a benefit as it relates to the increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=815.266s">So</a> if I understand that chart correctly here, the billing cycle as it will go onto this new rate system will be as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=829.191s">I</a> believe you're getting to an approximate amount <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=836.405s">76%</a> from 66 to 76% of the single-family homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=842.109s">Condos</a> will go from 82 to 90%. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=843.61s">And</a> these are keeping the people in the 0 to 1,000 mark. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=848.433s">The</a> two-family will go from 76 to 85. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=850.254s">The</a> three-families will go from 79% to 87. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=854.257s">And</a> the four-family will go from 68. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=856.659s">And</a> that basically stayed the same at 68%. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=861.382s">Taking</a> all this into consideration, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=863.897s">What</a> it represents financially to the city is the following amount total. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=869.139s">It's</a> a savings of $69,230 and overall condos overall in the city will save approximately $39,363. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=874.081s">Single</a> families will come up to $21,881. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=876.281s">Two</a> families will come up to $6,888. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=877.322s">And</a> the three families, there's a saving of $1,096 total overall. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=893.13s">With</a> that being said, the opportunity is now increased for more savings. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=898.353s">I</a> believe, if I understand all of this correctly, that once you get to that zero to 1,000 mark, you go to 1,001, you'll only be charged a difference between 1,000 and 1,001 if you fall into that second tier system. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=912.942s">And</a> it would be the same argument going forward for the one to the two and the two and the two and the top. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=918.986s">I</a> want to thank Mr. Baker in particular and his working crew <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=923.238s">the</a> board for recognizing the fact that we need a little bit more equity in this water and sewer rate structure, since in fact it's an $8.5 million surplus sitting over there, and since in fact the mayor has yet to present anything to us that talks about a water and sewer street construction or water and sewer improvements in this community, and as the law writes itself, it basically says it either has to go to that type of a component, a water and sewer street reconstruction or water and sewer reconstruction, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=953.223s">or</a> the money has to go back to the rate payers. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=955.623s">So</a> I would hope that this is probably somewhat of a first step at looking at where we're going with this excess money that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=962.485s">Also,</a> with the tiered system that the council on numerous occasions has spoken to about, and now we'll have an opportunity to see it by increasing from 800 to 1,000 and from 1,600 to 2,000, the max on both, that's 200 cubic feet in the water, it's 400 cubic feet <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=982.395s">Tier</a> 2, which is the commercial rate, and above that, it's everyone else that uses it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=986.258s">It's</a> a high volume group and density. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=988.78s">I</a> think it's a good start. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=989.841s">And</a> once we get those adjustments recalculated, we'll have a better idea as to where we're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=995.465s">But</a> as it stands right now, I believe this will take effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=999.908s">If</a> I understand this, it's the next billing cycle, not the one that we just had. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1003.69s">I</a> believe it's the next billing cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1005.812s">So</a> with that being said, I just thought <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1010.607s">They</a> should be noticed out, and taxpayers should be aware of it, and people who did it should be recognized.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1056.448s">I</a> believe that's a separate issue as it relates to how the Water and Sewer Commission has now gotten into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1062.89s">We</a> did not have a tiered rate system at that point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1065.171s">The</a> tiered rate system <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1066.233s">I</a> believe came in October, November of this past year. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1069.014s">As</a> a result of that, and because of the pushback and the concerns from rate payers and taxpayers, their initial tier one, two, and three systems had somewhat of a concern with people as to the charges. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1081.621s">So</a> listening to not only the council, council members and taxpayers, they bumped it up to zero to 1,000 instead of zero to 800. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1088.724s">And</a> the 1,000 now goes to one to 2,000 and 2,000 plus coming up to be the max. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1096.13s">There</a> are representative percentages as it relates to your water bill that's coming forward, how and what the mayor is going to do relative to the 600,000 that the council cut out. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1106.157s">We</a> still haven't seen that and have no idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1108.459s">And</a> you know, as we know, each and every year for the last four years, there's been a million dollar surplus or thereabouts sitting in a, and that's how we get in our free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1117.225s">So,</a> so maybe that's how it's just going to Peter itself out at the end of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1120.067s">I</a> don't know.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1163.856s">Let's</a> go.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1235.626s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1237.287s">You're</a> right about the increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1239.008s">I</a> believe it was a 10% or 11% increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1241.789s">That</a> represented the $600,000 in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1244.891s">And</a> I believe that the four members of the council who voted to eliminate that out of the budget was because of the fact that we had an $8.5 million surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1252.275s">And</a> because we had $8.5 million surplus, why should we be going out and taxing on that particular part? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1259.158s">This</a> here is something, apparently, that goes back, I believe, to April or May of 2014, when they first had a discussion on a rate system. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1270.465s">I</a> think it was Councilman Marks who originally brought up the issue on the more you use, the more you pay in commercial vendors. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1276.308s">And</a> I think this goes back to the former city engineer, who supposedly was in charge of whatever he was in charge of. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1284.133s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1285.858s">But</a> to get to this point here, it's a combination of not only conservation, but I think it's also a slow way of maybe addressing any increase that might be taking place in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1295.645s">But</a> this also has a component with the EPA, the federal EPA coming in here looking at a conservation method as it relates to water usage. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1304.211s">And</a> they have this broken down, what they think per person, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1307.353s">Of</a> course, the argument to that is if you have two or three or four kids in the family, that's all down the drain anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1312.236s">But</a> that's neither here nor there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1313.816s">So</a> this is a beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1315.057s">This</a> isn't a do all, be all. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1316.418s">It's</a> a beginning to not only do the conservation, but once again, we see what the numbers and other numbers come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1321.042s">And</a> if it works, it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1324.245s">If</a> it doesn't work, then we're going to have to look at it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1326.146s">But</a> it's better than going up with the rates and the cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1330.51s">It's</a> coming down to all four categories. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1333.592s">Single</a> family, condo, two family, and three family. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1336.375s">Four</a> families all stayed the same.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1403.879s">Thank</a> you, Honorable. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1404.92s">Continue</a> on that further? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1406.701s">I</a> was going to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1408.062s">That's</a> my last point. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1408.902s">So</a> you just brought it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1409.623s">So</a> I want to thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1410.964s">I</a> think, from what I understand from my involvement with Mass Municipal Association, cities and towns are now getting together just as it relates to that particular point. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1419.609s">So</a> maybe at the outset, and I don't know how to begin this, but maybe at the outset, maybe it should be City of Medford writes something to our state legislation or maybe to the MWRA and ask them <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1429.33s">for</a> them to set up some type of a system, maybe during certain months of the year, knowing where there's a lot of snowfall, that a lot of that water may go down the drain. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1435.952s">Because</a> they can tell you the increase, the amount of the increase of the water flow. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1440.713s">It's</a> obvious that some kind of a consideration is given or some kind of credit is given or whatever it might be, because it doesn't happen all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1448.595s">It's</a> only at this time of the year.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1873.975s">I'd</a> like to echo your comments, Councilor, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1876.416s">Monty</a> Hilson, well recognized within the boys baseball organizations, especially, you know, with the younger children. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1884.819s">And</a> I just think it's a fine recognition for long years of service.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1911.434s">Mr.</a> President, Lieutenant Goulding, Michael Goulding is a fine young man. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1916.216s">He's</a> had many wonderful years here in the Method Police Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1919.597s">And</a> I know our chief who's here right now tonight is sorry to see him go, but I think he's, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1924.53s">happy</a> to know he's been able to be elevated to a like comparison to him being a chief of another nice community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1932.094s">And</a> I just think it's nice to recognize one of our own achieving this type of a station in their life. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1939.919s">And</a> last night, the town of Western Board of Selectmen voted him in unanimously. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1944.281s">So</a> I just think it would be a proper, just to make a public recognition.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2367.467s">Um,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2368.447s">Uh,</a> I thank Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2370.107s">Uh,</a> we had a discussion on this earlier this week as it relates to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2373.268s">Uh,</a> I, I think it would be equally as important to have somebody here from, uh, Maura Haley's office as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2377.83s">This</a> was a 48 page decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2379.978s">And</a> I think it would be, you know, this council's been on top of this since day one. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2384.161s">We've</a> involved ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2386.162s">We've</a> had health partners, folks here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2388.543s">We</a> had Mr. Sachs here a couple of times, whether he agreed or disagreed, what his comments were. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2394.467s">At</a> least they were there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2395.147s">There</a> was a public, two public forums. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2397.969s">But</a> the key is not because of the Lawrence Memorial Hospital or the Melrose Lakeville Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2403.752s">The</a> key to this whole story is the one down the South Shore. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2406.454s">And</a> that was the telling sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2409.812s">I</a> have some of the documents that she has issued, Maura Healy, but I think it would be important to have somebody here because I believe that there are other options available to the Lawrence Memorial Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2420.075s">It</a> may not be as great as what Partners was going to offer, but I think something like that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2426.677s">Also,</a> the fact that not only did Mr. Sack retire when we were told that he was going to continue on and be in charge of the Melrose-Wakefield, no matter what happened to this situation here, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2439.558s">So</a> I think there needs to be some information, Rick, on why he retired so suddenly, you know, and you would hope it's not a million dollar balloon payout because they didn't get their way. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2450.564s">I</a> mean, and who's going to be left holding the bag here is going to be all the patients and the doctors and the nurses that don't have an opportunity to go to that hospital or won't have an opportunity to go to that hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2460.108s">And</a> as we saw the amount of money that's being infused into the Melrose Wakefield Hospital, it's a pittance compared to what's taking place over here at the Lawrence Memorial. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2468.268s">So,</a> unfortunately, I think we're at the tail end of the stick on this one here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2471.709s">But</a> putting that aside, I think the other part of the story is I respectfully request that somebody from Maura Healey's office be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2480.753s">And</a> I think to have them all here at the same time to explain it would make a lot — would make sense.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2736.286s">Picking</a> up on what Councilor Camuso just alluded to, the fact of the matter is that I believe it was Mara Healy, her position was integrated with a host of other hospitals, presidents and executives from other hospitals, who said that this competition would be devastating to them <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2756.71s">It</a> would put partners in such a position that they would have some kind of a control that would take years and years and years to overcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2763.272s">Also,</a> there was no proven fact that the rates would go down as partners said that they would. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2769.374s">And</a> apparently, the documents that were submitted by these other executives from these other hospitals were enough to tantalize, let's put it this way, Maury Haley to the point of saying, hey, I'm not going to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2778.936s">But</a> also, she did indicate that if this went through, she was going to sue the judge because of the decision <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2784.865s">that</a> she made, and she felt as a result of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2787.827s">Now,</a> whether you agree or disagree with Maura Healy and why she's doing what she did, I don't think we can answer that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2794.83s">I</a> think we'll have a better understanding when all the parties are here and they can tell us what their reasoning is and what their reasoning isn't going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2802.214s">I</a> think Lawrence is the low man on the totem pole of all of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2805.216s">There</a> was the South Shore Hospital first, then it's the Melrose-Wakefield, and they're going to be taken care of, and it's us. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2810.018s">But</a> I believe that there is a game plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2811.579s">I</a> believe that there is a game plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2813.373s">may</a> not be as grandiose as they would have liked with partners coming on. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2818.397s">In</a> the 48-page decision that the judge wrote, she did say that there was a belief that the rising cost would be an estimated $50 million a year because of this merger. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2833.228s">And</a> because of this merger and the $50 million, and because of the opposition from other hospital executives and presidents, I believe that that probably weighed pretty heavily <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2843.72s">on</a> making the judge make the decision or to judge making her decision after knowing what Maura Healey was going to do, if, in fact, she did pass it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2853.287s">So.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3231.017s">Are</a> there any, maybe you should also refer this to the Office of Community Development to find out if there's any proposed <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3238.186s">that's</a> being scheduled for that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3240.148s">Councilor</a> Knight just alluded to something for which we all agreed upon on Locust Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3244.37s">And</a> you know, maybe it's always a sad situation, but maybe because of this building, it could stop the redevelopment of that particular area as it relates to, you know, where they're going, storefront signs, designs, sidewalks, and a whole host of other businesses that are down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3260.16s">So</a> I'd like to refer that to the OCD office as well to see if they might have a review on this particular subject matter.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3732.055s">Question.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3733.637s">Do</a> you want these for all in together or do you want to do them independently? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3736.719s">Because</a> each square is different to each other.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4148.887s">The</a> recent passing of Bill Mumbo-Katt here in the city of Medford, I think really highlights the fact that he is somewhat of a baseball legend, probably. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4159.935s">Medford</a> has been blessed with many, many baseball players, but this gentleman did it at a time back in the early 50s when he was practicing with a fellow by the name of Gus Hennessey. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4171.312s">And</a> they would go down and play Stead Park continuously. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4173.933s">And</a> he would just pitch to them and pitch to them and pitch to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4176.953s">And</a> eventually, he finally made it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4179.454s">But</a> he made it in a time and a period. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4182.014s">Eddie</a> Finn, you remember this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4183.414s">He</a> made it in a time that there was only eight professional baseball teams in either seat. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4187.075s">Now</a> there's 32. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4187.895s">But</a> there was only eight American League teams, eight National League teams. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4192.316s">And</a> it was tough. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4192.996s">And</a> when he went into the minors, he just didn't come up right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4195.757s">He</a> had to earn his spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4197.577s">And</a> he has a very interesting baseball career. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4201.45s">But</a> one of his real major accomplishments, and I don't even think he realized it until it happened, they were playing against the Washington Senators on a particular night. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4209.673s">And</a> I believe he had struck out 17 baseball, 17 players. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4214.875s">And</a> the coach of the Washington Senators, his name was William McCauley, came up to him toward the end of the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4222.158s">And</a> somebody wants to talk to him. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4223.659s">The</a> president wants to talk to him. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4224.679s">That's</a> the terminology. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4225.719s">The</a> president wants to talk to him. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4226.78s">And</a> he thought it was the president of the baseball team or the president of the league and this and that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4230.425s">But</a> it was Dwight Eisenhower. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4232.826s">And</a> Dwight Eisenhower was so impressed with him that he wanted a ball signed by him. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4237.527s">And</a> when the president asked him, where did you come from? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4240.288s">And</a> he says, Meffa. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4241.908s">Meffa.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4242.728s">And</a> it was sort of like, and he says, why do all you people down there talk like that? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4246.53s">I</a> mean, what do you? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4247.97s">And</a> it was kind of like, it was a cool situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4250.911s">But</a> the night he threw his no-hitter in Chicago on August 1, 1962 against a veteran, a very good veteran pitcher, early win. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4259.741s">That</a> was a real highlight here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4262.863s">No</a> one had ever thrown a, no one ever came from Medford to throw it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4267.225s">And</a> if I have my story correctly, I believe when he came back to Medford at that time, engine six drove him, picked him up and gave him somewhat of a mini parade here in the city of Medford, acknowledging the fact that who he was and how he was, you know, he was an all-star pitcher for the all-star teams for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4282.714s">He</a> played professional, he pitched professional baseball for 11 years between the Red Sox and the Yankees. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4289.385s">And</a> I guess his ending comment, which I happened to notice, and I'm glad that they printed it in the local press, he made the comment that he loved playing baseball so much that he would have played for nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4303.374s">And</a> if people only would realize what that would mean to today's kids that are playing professional sports, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4310.879s">They're</a> into the millions and millions of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4312.48s">I</a> believe when he was pitching, the year he threw the no-hitter, he was making $8,000, and I believe they offered him up to 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4319.126s">the</a> following year. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4320.086s">And</a> that's just craziness for money back then. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4324.548s">And</a> if you look at him today, what his statistics would have been and what he could have probably earned, it's probably just unfathomable. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4330.771s">But</a> it's baseball as it was then. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4333.032s">That's</a> what they paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4333.872s">That's</a> what it was all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4335.473s">But</a> I think it would be a great opportunity for the Medford sports kids to know that this fellow grew up here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4342.576s">He</a> worked this thing into the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4344.957s">He</a> played it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4346.178s">He</a> loved it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4347.253s">He</a> used to come back and watch Medford High Baseball. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4349.214s">He</a> used to come back because of family members at Medford High School Hockey. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4355.058s">He</a> just really was a true gentleman to the sport. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4358.58s">He</a> wasn't flamboyant or anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4361.221s">He</a> was just a regular guy who just proved here in the city of Medford and any place else in this country, if you work hard enough at something that you want, it'd be great by today's standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4369.286s">I</a> mean, like I said, I had a whole list of 32 names of people who <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4373.85s">made</a> professional sports through the minor leagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4376.331s">But</a> this guy made it in the majors. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4378.332s">And</a> he made it in such a way that nobody expected to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4381.234s">And</a> he just made the city of Medford so proud to know that, you know, he could accomplish what he did for the city of Medford, for professional baseball, because he loved it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4390.559s">And</a> like he said, he would have done it for nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4392.54s">And</a> you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4393.46s">He</a> probably did play for nothing, because that's how much he really loved the sport. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4397.302s">And</a> to his wife, Josephine, and the family, you know, you can be very proud of the fact that you had a great husband. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4402.972s">who</a> did the city of Medford proud, and you did him proud as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4406.293s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to pass that on. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4409.173s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4410.173s">Councilor</a> Knight?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4576.179s">He</a> was a real personal friend of mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4578.261s">I</a> worked with him for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4580.282s">Unfortunately,</a> he passed away. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4582.264s">He</a> has a wonderful family, Sharon, Sam, Sawyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4586.967s">And</a> this is a tough one, because sometimes when life pops up in front of you and things happen, you just sometimes you don't know what to say or how to react to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4600.983s">He</a> loved the outdoors. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4602.104s">He</a> was great with the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4603.425s">He</a> was a coach. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4605.667s">He</a> was a great family man. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4608.589s">But</a> for whatever the reason that God decided to say, this is your time, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4613.112s">But</a> I would just like to let them know, and the Brown family, that their thoughts are at least with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4619.257s">He</a> was a good guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4620.018s">He</a> comes from a good family. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4622.039s">His</a> wife, Sharon, Sam Sawyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4628.208s">I</a> don't know what to say other than the fact that he was, you know, it was, it's one of these times in your life that something happens and you just can't explain it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4637.274s">And,</a> um, but I'm not going to try to explain it right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4639.995s">Other</a> than the saying, I just wish the family well at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4643.357s">We</a> all thank you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4692.801s">I</a> apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4693.461s">He</a> had three kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4694.322s">I</a> kept mentioning, I think I only said it too. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4696.043s">It's</a> Sam Sawyer and Sarah. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4698.785s">It's</a> Sarah, Sam and Sam. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4700.566s">Wow.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4701.447s">Sam,</a> Sarah and Sawyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4705.129s">I'm</a> sorry.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5069.258s">Yeah,</a> during the last snowstorm, not this one, the first one, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5074.282s">We're</a> all snowbound in.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5077.545s">Yeah,</a> well, the first day of the first storm. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5079.046s">Let's</a> put it that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5080.427s">I</a> received a phone call from one of the president managing partners. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5082.989s">And</a> I had about a half hour conversation with him. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5085.171s">He</a> indicated to me that they are going to have five houses on the Medford side. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5089.094s">There</a> are going to be five houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5091.215s">And</a> with those five houses, I always said, I don't care what you're doing in Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5094.238s">I'm</a> more concerned of what's going to happen here in Medford, its effect, and how this is going to play out. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5099.802s">So</a> he is concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5101.263s">He</a> is aware of the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5102.443s">that</a> there was a concern because of the five houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5105.105s">So</a> I don't think, again, from my conversation, my take was, I don't think there's been that much involvement between the city and him, other than the fact that they're having this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5114.693s">Nothing</a> is definitive, but at the same time, they are aware that these five houses, which are less than what the original amount was gonna be, I believe it was either, I think it was nine, I don't think the original number was. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5127.423s">Seven,</a> was it? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5128.364s">Seven,</a> so it's down to five, but there's. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5131.623s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5131.903s">So</a> as a result of that, um, he is aware of the fact that Medford has a game, you know, a stake in this game and, and, uh, is that tomorrow night?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5743.346s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5744.987s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5745.907s">Quick</a> question on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5746.948s">On</a> this cell tower that's going up, this is the one with the red beacon on the top? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5750.99s">It's</a> not going up. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5752.09s">I</a> mean, it's up. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5752.571s">Is</a> this the one with the red beacon that goes off? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5754.852s">Are</a> there other towers that, I mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5757.597s">sell</a> things on there like AT&T and Verizon, they aren't attached to that? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5762.459s">Because</a> if that's the case, we don't even know if they're being assessed, and that's tax revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5766.98s">So</a> maybe we can get a further report back from the building commission to find out if- As amended, if they're producing revenue?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5963.95s">I'd</a> like to hear from the gentleman, the citizen first. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5966.491s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=5967.051s">He's</a> been waiting.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6367.223s">Thank</a> you, Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6368.544s">Councilor</a> Penta? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6369.304s">Chief,</a> with all due respect to that decision that was made, the contract that was written on September 10th and then executed on October 7th with only a change of one word, both explicitly have a time zone in there of 7 to 7. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6385.616s">The</a> RFP that went out was 7 to 7. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6388.13s">The</a> three bidders that came in were 7 to 7. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6391.433s">That's</a> a material change to the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6395.216s">I</a> understand what you're saying.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6400.54s">I</a> would think in all fairness to the other bidders and the competitors that they probably should be advised now that the city of Medford is changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6408.387s">Because</a> I don't even know if the city is opening themselves up to a lawsuit here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6411.429s">Because</a> I think if I was one of the other competitors, I'd be very concerned over this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6416.067s">An</a> hour in the morning, an hour at night, six days a week, that's how many hours a week? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6420.931s">It's</a> 12 hours of enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6422.432s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6422.832s">That's</a> 12 hours that they're losing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6424.533s">That's</a> 48 hours a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6425.834s">Four</a> times, that's four months out of the week. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6428.096s">And</a> if they all had the same opportunity to bid the same way, OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6431.218s">Making</a> all these other changes, OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6432.92s">I</a> think you can live with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6434.421s">But</a> that's a material change. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6436.342s">That's</a> a huge change.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6456.298s">But</a> that's not as much as the material.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6484.329s">Well,</a> they were up there today.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6500.314s">You</a> bring up a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6501.275s">I</a> hope no city employee, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6502.788s">is</a> helping to shovel out any of those kiosks.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6527.945s">Chief,</a> there's a couple of, Mr. President, there's a couple of things I think that the taxpayers should be aware of as to what took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6534.871s">I</a> don't see anything wrong with reading them off and letting the people know what's going on, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6540.796s">So</a> if you don't want to read them, then I will read them.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6546.682s">No,</a> this is too important an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6547.923s">Don't</a> start with the minute thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6549.164s">We</a> did. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6549.464s">It's</a> too important of an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6552.066s">The</a> council recommendations regarding 15 Oh 22. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6555.893s">It</a> says meters must be shut off during non-enforcement time. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6559.075s">The</a> answer is that the meters will read no charge parking period after hours on Sundays and federal holidays. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6567.959s">So</a> they're going to change the meter to do that?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6600.565s">Next</a> one, it indicates that a 10 minute grace period be granted at the end of a time period. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6607.228s">The</a> answer is that per Republic parking, there was generally a five minute grace period from the time the vehicle takes note of expiration to the issuance of a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6615.473s">This</a> is due to the driver having to park his vehicle and walk to the sighted vehicle and then put information for the ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6621.596s">Now,</a> is this for kiosks or is this for signs?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6670.346s">Two</a> points that we had spoken about before last time was <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6673.577s">having</a> these kiosks in front of a residential apartment or a building. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6678.78s">The</a> one in West Medford, we had talked about putting it by the Brookline Bank, getting rid of the kiosks and putting a 30-minute sign period from here to corner and taking the one out in front of the apartment building.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6703.868s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6710.61s">You</a> also have it on High Street here in Medford, right opposite the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6714.391s">There's</a> a kiosk in front of the apartment building. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6717.291s">Makes</a> no sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6718.712s">There's</a> a kiosk in front of the apartment building.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6721.732s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6755.966s">So</a> then you would be penalizing any doctor or any emergency control type of person or a visiting nurse or somebody who <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6761.485s">doesn't</a> have an opportunity or right to park in the building down below, not knowing about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6765.507s">So</a> if they park in front of the building, they're going to get tagged and ticketed?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6792.882s">I</a> mean, you know, you don't want to hear the story about the library right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6796.343s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6846.767s">How</a> do you figure that?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6851.31s">Yeah,</a> but they should be done intelligently.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6915.073s">Well,</a> you want to talk for two minutes or 43 seconds from the chair? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6919.675s">Number</a> three, Mr. President, um, tickets issued on January 15th and 16th to be waived. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6925.578s">The</a> answer is the individual has a right to appeal any ticket according to the lawful procedures. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6930.24s">Again,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6931.609s">I</a> think it's totally unfair, because we all know what happened on that particular day.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6951.519s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6951.679s">They</a> had nothing on there.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6963.971s">These</a> didn't have them on their chief.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7075.887s">Add</a> orange to the ticket color coded in an envelope. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7079.65s">Republic</a> says that they'll add orange to the ticket, but they're not going to have an envelope because it's, quote, it's sound environmental practice not to put an envelope. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7089.218s">And</a> that's kind of odd.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7107.803s">Then</a> it says asked to change the word from officer on ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7111.386s">And</a> they're not going to change it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7112.286s">They're</a> keeping the word officer.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7121.413s">Then</a> the next one on the next page is that reflective signs be placed on both sides of the kiosk. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7125.536s">It</a> says Republicans in the process <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7128.24s">of</a> ordering additional all-weather signs to affix, blah, blah, blah. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7131.282s">The</a> next one, that the license plate reader technology be used for the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7136.404s">Purchase.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7137.184s">Purchase.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7137.605s">The</a> answer from the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7138.545s">As</a> was mentioned at the city council meeting on January 20th, 2015, the council met with Republic earlier in the month regarding this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7145.108s">It</a> is currently in the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7146.669s">And</a> as soon as more detailed information is available, you'll be provided with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7151.131s">What</a> does Republic have to do with this, with you people?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7181.57s">Another,</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7198.287s">On</a> that particular matter that Councilor Knight just brings up, Councilor Caraviello and myself had the opportunity to be at the MMA meeting and when there were five vendors there, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7208.166s">as</a> it relates to the model and make that we have here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7211.588s">And</a> I believe it was the distribution company for Republic that we were dealing with. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7215.55s">And</a> we got the cheapest, lowest grade model of a parking meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7219.172s">So</a> I just thought I'd let you know.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7352.334s">I</a> think the question was both asked by us, just the two of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7355.596s">What</a> other options? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7356.396s">They</a> asked it to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7357.537s">Weren't</a> you shown these other options? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7359.077s">And</a> the answer had to be no. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7360.638s">And</a> how are you supposed to answer that? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7362.899s">We</a> were only shown one machine and that was it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8282.061s">Um,</a> on the last two matters here, uh, you're working on having a debit card allegedly that could correlate to the, uh, to the car, but they're unable to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8291.687s">And</a> then the last one detailed maps to be developed to show, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8294.787s">Spots</a> are available by type of spot in a residential or in a commuter business district. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8299.729s">Now,</a> I got a couple of phone calls from people up on Quincy Street at resident parking.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8339.17s">So</a> the three from that neighborhood all have the same issue then?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8363.921s">But</a> it also says that detailed maps are finalized and posted on Park Medford.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8380.037s">So</a> resident parking maps are not on there yet?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8412.822s">But</a> when you're doing these resident parking documents, maps or whatever they are.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8421.427s">But</a> some of the streets aren't all resident parking.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8425.709s">So</a> like you explained last week, um, Austin street, the number, it stops at a certain number. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8432.273s">I</a> mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8432.92s">How</a> are these people supposed to know?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8437.002s">Yeah,</a> but how does Republic know?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8513.172s">One</a> final thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8515.273s">I'd</a> like to, can we get a report back? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8517.174s">You</a> said the, um, the decision today by the city solicitor that you could change the hours.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8544.219s">I'd</a> like to have a copy of that, Mr. Clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8546.741s">A</a> copy of-
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9509.302s">I'd</a> like to send a, um, the council send some congratulations to, uh, not congratulations, some get well wishes to Rick Caraviello, his father, who unfortunately is in the hospital right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9518.884s">And,</a> uh, thank you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_Fcwn-qU-L9c/2025-03-21_Fcwn-qU-L9c.html">Medford City Council - January 20, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=247.913s">I'm</a> shocked that you didn't know four years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=249.835s">She's</a> following in the good footsteps of Jesse Jessalonis, who won that for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=254.698s">And</a> so we have an excellent tree history here in the city of Medford, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=258.601s">So,</a> Aggie, continue on, and good luck.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=741.47s">What</a> are we talking about?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=780.94s">My</a> question I think would become curious to the point that since it's not included specifically, if this would need a public advertisement to change the zoning to include it rather than come under the guys quote unquote of other institution in your other institution of what you're saying is an adult daycare center, which is not found under, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=802.025s">an</a> exact terminology as another institution.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=823.149s">Well,</a> that's what my concern would be, to give something out that wasn't properly vetted, so to speak, through rezoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=828.549s">I've</a> got no problem going forward with it, but I'd like to get a report back. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=832.285s">as</a> to whether this terminology, what are you calling an adult daycare center, since it's not found under the terminology of other institution can be included under the term other institution for the purposes of this particular vote.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=859.693s">whether</a> the zoning for an adult daycare center is legal terminology for other institutions, or does, in fact, a public hearing have to take place to make this become inclusive of other institutions?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=918.32s">ordinance</a> in itself, but all fairness to the council and anyone who watching and the petition is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=923.281s">I</a> don't have a letter that says that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=924.921s">So</a> if the building commissioner is the, um, I won't use the terminology zoning authority to make this inclusive of other institution. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=933.103s">I</a> think we should have had a letter that said that because it's obvious that we're operating other institution by including the terminology adult daycare center, um, LLC to be, to be included here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=945.667s">I'm</a> just protecting our interests, but more importantly, I want to make sure that the zoning is appropriate for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=950.75s">And</a> so nothing comes back and says, wait a minute, you know, it's not included. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=954.031s">It's</a> not the way it's supposed to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=955.452s">I've</a> got no problem going forward with it, but I want that letter that says that this adult daycare center can be constituted as a legal entity under other institution on the unit than the use of it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1509.471s">Two</a> quick questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1510.311s">Um,</a> for people who might be watching, can you tell them where one-on-one Mr. Gav, what's that one-on-one Mr. Gav right now?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1524.621s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1526.062s">And</a> you indicated you could serve as 100 clients. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1528.204s">Is</a> that on the spot, or that during the course of the? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1530.426s">How</a> many can you actually have on that location at one time? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1533.568s">About</a> 100. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1535.73s">You</a> could have 100 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1537.291s">So</a> your 25 to 30 people could handle 100 people at any one time? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1542.775s">No</a> matter what their problems might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1545.456s">So</a> if anyone has probably a somewhat of a psychiatric type of a problem, you can handle that?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1558.89s">But</a> how are you supposed to know that if somebody wants to apply?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1580.984s">But</a> this is for the purposes of anyone who might be watching so they have a better understanding.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1718.501s">Mr.</a> President, we all know that Dr. Lepore has an extreme interest in musical instruments because he plays one himself. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1726.043s">But</a> he started on this adventure a few years ago up at the State House when he had a bill introduced by Representative Paul Donato as it relates to the sterilization of musical instruments in schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1739.386s">The</a> bill, as reported out and signed by the governor on his last day in office, number 4384, states the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1747.588s">Upon</a> the issuance of a musical wind instrument to a borrowing student attending grades pre-kindergarten through 12 and any public <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1755.077s">or</a> commonwealth charter school, the issuing school shall inform the parent or guardian of the student that while the musical wind instrument was sanitized, it may also be sterilized in order to ensure that all microbiome life has been eradicated within the instrument. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1771.949s">Now,</a> we all know that there was a tremendous amount of concern as it relates to using pieces of instruments that children use in the public schools or charter schools <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1784.619s">or</a> public school administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1787.86s">Through</a> Tufts University, its medical school, and a whole host of medical individuals, the Federal Food and Drug Administration became very supportive once they recognized the fact that this has a legitimate concern, where they wrote, quote, we recognize that with respect to cross-contamination risks and the associated microbiological implications, musical wind instruments <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1813.971s">are</a> not unlike other contaminated medical dental devices. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1817.772s">It</a> states that a valid public health issue consistent with the universal precautions adhere to in the medical dental settings relative to instruments contaminated with bodily fluids. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1828.254s">And</a> as such, this agency, which is the FDA, believes that the classification of sterilized musical wind instruments falls under the jurisdiction of the Environmental Protection Agency and is simply concurring with the conventional medical wisdom that sterilizing items <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1843.678s">contaminated</a> with body fluids between uses is inappropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1847.76s">Now,</a> we all know that if you went to a restaurant, it would be absolutely inappropriate to use somebody else's fork, spoon, or drink from their glass because there are strict sterilization issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1858.624s">It's</a> the same thing you tell your kids not to use somebody else's toothbrush other than their own. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1865.607s">And</a> you can go and you can start making all these analogies as it relates to the misuse or the abuse that somebody might find themselves in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1873.567s">because</a> of the fact that something either wasn't sterilized or it wasn't brought to the parental attention for the purposes of letting them know that their children, to be safe, needs to have this stuff sterilized. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1885.55s">Restaurants</a> and hospitals follow strict public health rules and regulations and standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1891.011s">And</a> this was a long journey because it was sort of like virgin in the territories of people who just didn't understand this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1899.252s">Some</a> 25 years ago, you would never think of going to a dentist. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1902.886s">so</a> to speak, and he or she would put their fingers in your mouth without gloves. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1907.789s">And</a> ever since the fact that they now wear gloves, you would come to your attention immediately if you went to a dentist, male or female, and they decided to stick their finger in your mouth without a sterilized, whatever the color might be of the glove that they have to wear. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1923.62s">This</a> is a real big issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1926.501s">This</a> isn't a requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1927.542s">This</a> is a voluntarily <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1929.913s">encounter</a> that a parent will have now with their child who decides to want to use this instrument, or whatever the wind instrument might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1938.899s">I</a> think it was some two to three summers ago, there was a story in the Boston Globe that identified some 30,000 pieces of wind instruments being stored in the Boston public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1952.427s">And</a> as a result of that, having not been used for years, and as a result of that, and having the microbiological <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1960.505s">factor</a> come into play, showing that the danger that these kids would have by blowing these instruments is something that basically, again, accelerated not only Dr. Lepore's interest in this, but also the state legislature. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1973.408s">And</a> I have to say publicly, if it wasn't for Representative Donato leading the charge in this on Beacon Hill, fighting this and introducing it each and every year for the last, I believe, four years up at the Statehouse for the purposes of educating <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=1986.697s">his</a> fellow lawmakers, and having the governor not only accept it when he first came on, he authorized a, strike that, he entertained a commission for the purpose of not only reviewing it, but they wrote a report in 100% support of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2003.128s">So,</a> what I'd like to do, Mr. President, I'd like to invite Dr. Lepore to come here, and I think it would be a great acknowledgement to, again, one of our own, you know, kind of like Fortunate, we have it in the medical field, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2014.862s">We</a> have it in the legal field. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2015.963s">Most</a> recently, we have Victor Garrow, who received a nationwide award for his position of taking on a case for 30 years and defending somebody, proving that the gentleman was innocent and not guilty. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2026.607s">And</a> here we have another situation here where we have a renowned dentist here in our community who also happens to be a gentleman who plays a wind instrument, who saw the need for this to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2039.033s">He</a> saw the need for parents to be advised and become prepared. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2042.222s">And</a> he also saw the fact that an infectious disease, which is at the core of this whole thing, this is a prevention of infectious diseases, could be taking place and be corrected. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2054.188s">I</a> think that's a good thing for not only the city of Met, but for the entire Commonwealth of Massachusetts and anyone who wants to believe in the fact that, you know, this is a good, it's a good bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2063.352s">So</a> with that being said, I move, Mr. President, that Dr. Lepore be invited to come at a future date and he be duly recognized for the <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2071.747s">having</a> the bill passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2072.688s">And</a> you know something, I might even want to invite Representative Donato here, too, because this wasn't one of those easy bills that you can just get through. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2078.913s">A</a> lot of people sometimes couldn't understand it, don't understand the medical part of it, and you have a lot of new reps coming and going. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2084.858s">So</a> it took some time for the purposes of having this happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2087.52s">And</a> you had some opposition. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2088.44s">Yeah,</a> there was. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2088.921s">I</a> found it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2090.442s">But</a> he worked himself through it, and the legislature finally, and the governor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2094.946s">The</a> governor was on board right from the beginning, but the legislature finally saw through it, and it finally got itself passed.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2133.588s">Mr.</a> President, last week we had a, once again for the second week in a row, this is now running ourselves into the third week as it relates to this parking program that the mayor has initiated. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2143.23s">But</a> I think it's time we get a few issues straight right from the beginning because I don't want any misrepresentation to go out there before we get into our discussion as it relates to just what the council's position is on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2155.273s">Councilor</a> Camuso, you made some comments relative or earlier, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2158.785s">that</a> the council, on other occasions prior to this, voted, I believe you said, for a revenue, for a program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2166.233s">What</a> the council voted for... Can I, councillor? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2168.775s">Can</a> I finish my position, please?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2196.64s">I</a> don't think it's a matter of point of information.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2267.191s">Mr.</a> President, continuing on those votes at the council took all the council was for a traffic enforcement, not a revenue enhancement program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2275.796s">And</a> I think the records will verify that, but let's get right to the crux of the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2280.959s">On</a> May 20th on May 20th of this past year, we received a letter from the <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2287.637s">to</a> the president of the council from the mayor, but basically said that the parking management program, the authority intend to an agreement exceeding three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2296.082s">Dear</a> Mr. President, members of the council, the city of Medford has received proposals from various vendors in response to our request for proposals for a parking management program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2305.508s">It</a> is the intention of the city to enter a 10 year agreement with the successful proposal pursuant to the site and section of the law approved for the contract that exceeds three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2315.726s">Now,</a> following that step further, the mayor indicated that I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body, pursuant to the provisions of Massachusetts General Law Chapter 30, Section B12, approve and authorize the city of Medford to enter into an agreement with the successful proposal for a term signed by the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2333.43s">And</a> at that council meeting on the 20th, those that spoke were Mr. Rumley, Mr. Stirella, and Mr. D'Antonio. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2338.971s">That</a> resolution was amended by myself at the very end. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2341.851s">It</a> states, amended by Councilor Penta, that the mayor <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2345.807s">and</a> the preferred vendor meeting with the council to explain the program in depth prior to the final decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2352.531s">But</a> upon further review of the tape of that particular meeting, that was not the amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2358.314s">The</a> amendment was as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2360.115s">It</a> was to amend the motion that the council meet before the signing so that we have a complete understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2367.059s">So</a> as amended, that having the mayor, whoever the vendor might be, present themselves before the council <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2374.127s">before</a> the finalization of the contract, before the finalization of the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2379.41s">So</a> why would the mayor want to, why would somebody want to come here before it was finalized? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2384.733s">If</a> in fact the mayor was going to sign it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2386.394s">Now</a> we met on September 10th at a committee of the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2389.856s">And</a> at that point in time, there was business folks that and Councilors that pushed back from the contract that was being presented to us at that time from the people who were there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2399.862s">And</a> at that point in time, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2401.515s">The</a> mayor decided to listen to all the things, left the room, and said he would come back with further. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2408.098s">And</a> when he came back further was with no vote by the council to discuss what took place by way of an amendment or by way of extras or what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2417.502s">As</a> a result of that, there's been some, I guess, misinformation being scuttled out there as it relates to just does where this Medford City Council stand. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2428.707s">This</a> Medford City Council had two proposals that took place on that May 20th. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2433.49s">On</a> that May 20th, we had A, we'd bring in one of the three vendors, for which it happened to be Republic, and B, we would get a report back if the city was to do it on its own with the financial breakdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2444.837s">We</a> never had an opportunity to vote on that one way or the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2447.679s">The</a> council's position, other than the fact, saying that the mayor has the authority to sign it, he does have the authority to sign it, but we never had the finalization of what was being presented to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2456.757s">So</a> what I'm offering here right now is the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2459.158s">It's</a> a resolution that the Medford City Council take their official position as to whether they support Mayor McGlynn's pay-to-park kiosk revenue enhancement program with the Republic Company from Tennessee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2469.461s">Very</a> simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2470.361s">Either</a> you're for it or you're against it so people have a clear understanding of where we all are. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2475.282s">You</a> can't one week turn around and say you're for it and another week you're against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2479.363s">And</a> I don't want to hear from Councilor Caraviello calling me up and telling me that the people are saying that I'm saying something about him. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2484.897s">vice</a> versa. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2485.778s">It</a> doesn't go that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2486.658s">My</a> comments have been pretty consistent and I'll say that in front of anyone that wants to challenge me to what I say. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2492.203s">That's</a> the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2493.624s">There</a> it is, Mr. Clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2494.885s">I'd</a> like to have the council vote on it and then we can continue on talking about it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2512.997s">Just</a> for the clarification... Took what vote, Mr. Paul? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2514.938s">We</a> didn't have no vote.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2547.121s">Point</a> of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2548.79s">what</a> the council voted for, seven to nothing, and I will agree to that, because that's what I voted on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2553.031s">That's</a> what I, to allow him to go forward and to negotiate with Republicans. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2557.712s">That's</a> what I wanted to do, and report back to the council before it was finalized for us to review it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2587.832s">I'm</a> talking about the meeting that took place on May 20th. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2591.436s">To</a> get those three vendors to come back, to get those three vendors to come back, you had to send the request out.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2602.206s">You</a> didn't even know about it until September 10th, when you got it for the first time.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2626.688s">Mr.</a> President, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2628.549s">I</a> move the question, Mr. President, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2630.311s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2634.293s">I'm</a> asking for the clerk.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2649.273s">Let's</a> do this one first. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2651.196s">And</a> then we have 022 before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2654.567s">I</a> am taking out of my resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2657.768s">I'm</a> filing this motion out of my resolution.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2715.027s">Point</a> of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2716.348s">Wait</a> a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2717.049s">I'm</a> not arguing that we didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2718.37s">We</a> took the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2719.39s">We</a> all took the vote to go out for an RFP, and we all took the vote for the mayor to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2724.334s">We</a> never took a final vote, as you voted for.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2758.33s">Mr.</a> President... The resolution's very simple.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2798.141s">That's</a> the reason- So like I said, Mr. President- Well, ask Councilor Caraviello the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2802.182s">You</a> even said you thought you were coming back to take a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2804.542s">Did</a> you not say that? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2805.942s">Councilor-</a> Thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2807.062s">There</a> he is right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=2807.923s">He</a> just-
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3877.209s">Councilor</a> Caraviello, point of information, Councilor Panto. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3881.726s">What</a> Councilor Camuso is saying is only 50% true because the RFP that went out also included the RFP on questions that came back from the three vendors. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3891.472s">We</a> as a council had no way of knowing what those questions and how they were going to be answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3895.754s">Councilor</a> Knight rightfully brought up the fact of the private vendor making the signs when that's a contract issue here with people who work for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3904.94s">But</a> the dual part of the story is that we asked for the city to make its presentation <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3910.687s">if</a> the city, in fact, was going to be the person that was going to put the kiosk or whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3916.43s">And</a> that's the reason why this Medford City Council voted seven to nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3920.091s">And</a> I'm quite sure the clerk in his minutes that took place in the executive session will attest to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3926.254s">Councilor</a> Caraviello?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3997.229s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=3998.991s">Those</a> votes that were taken were for traffic enforcement, not revenue enhancement. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4004.056s">Read</a> all the resolutions.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4058.34s">point</a> of personal privilege. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4059.861s">Since</a> you mentioned my name, let's get it straight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4062.062s">I</a> don't think the clerk has got to go down. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4063.603s">You've</a> already identified the fact that an RFP went out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4065.984s">We</a> have no argument with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4067.405s">You</a> also identified the fact that the mayor asked to go forward with one of the three vendors. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4072.468s">So</a> those are your two votes right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4074.108s">Those</a> are the only two votes that this council took on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4076.71s">But</a> the amendment, the amendment to the vote to go forward was predicated on bringing in A, the city's cost of what it would be, and B, a finalization before the council, before a contract was signed.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4089.116s">Listen,</a> you don't have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4090.117s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4090.757s">All</a> you have to do is watch the tape, ladies and gentlemen. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4092.958s">It's</a> as clear as the bell.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4167.099s">Just</a> mention my name again. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4168.899s">If</a> he has a vendetta, if he has a vendetta out for me, why don't you just tell the public that, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4172.86s">You're</a> a lame duck councillor, so your words, you can say anything you want about me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4176.201s">It</a> means absolutely nothing, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4179.442s">Well,</a> you can do it all you want in election time, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4181.883s">And</a> I'll do all I want during this period. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4184.443s">And</a> I know what I'm saying because this does not lie. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4187.824s">And</a> if you watch a councillor, that doesn't lie. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4190.505s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4227.685s">I</a> didn't mention my name. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4232.089s">You</a> certainly did. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4232.79s">You</a> just said Councilor Pantus. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4234.091s">I</a> said Councilor Pantus. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4236.373s">It's</a> my resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4238.075s">So</a> could you tell him to please be quiet and let somebody speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4243.633s">Rick,</a> not for anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4245.334s">If</a> everybody was so opposed to it, then according to Councilor Camuso, we should have never ever voted for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4250.916s">So,</a> you can't have it both ways.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4261.999s">No,</a> we didn't.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4268.312s">We</a> kind of get duped into something that never came to for a final vote.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4279.643s">And</a> there's the answer right there.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4389.107s">Question.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4394.409s">Then</a> the question is this, as a member of the chamber, did you vote for this or not when the board of directors voted, yes or no?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4717.924s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4719.005s">I</a> want to, I want to get to your question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4720.687s">You</a> just said,
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4722.961s">Point</a> of information? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4723.681s">Yeah,</a> point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4724.622s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4726.343s">There</a> are two opt-out positions in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4727.943s">After</a> 90 days, if this is not working out for either party, there's opt-out provisions, and there's an opt-out provision at the end of the first year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4734.787s">So</a> I just thought I'd let you know we don't have to live with this for 10 years.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=4737.988s">And</a> I'm quite sure there's going to be a whole host of legal questions that are going to arise that maybe Republicans are not going to want to entertain, because maybe they're just going to say this isn't worth it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5409.985s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5411.866s">Mr.</a> Nash, question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5414.227s">Tony,</a> I'm sorry, this is... I'm following this conversation as it relates, I believe he's alluding to using a kiosk, but if I drive down the street and I see a sign that says two-hour parking, and there's no kiosk, there's nothing, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5429.009s">How</a> are you going to know who got there at what time and when? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5432.131s">You're</a> not going to. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5432.991s">That's</a> the whole point.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5468.277s">So</a> they all work the same way. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5469.237s">No</a> matter what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5470.357s">If</a> I drive down the street and I see a half-hour parking area, and there's no kiosk, there's nothing, just the signs, there's a half-hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5476.839s">How</a> are you going to know what time I got there? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5479.019s">Because</a> you're driving around the city doing all this other enforcement.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5499.502s">But,</a> Dan, I mean, I could be sitting there for an hour or two before you eventually get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5502.623s">Of</a> course you can.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6556.672s">Why</a> would you want to sever it? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6557.393s">Why</a> don't you just include it? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6558.294s">Because</a> when you have the discussion next week, you'll have your answers.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6573.487s">Well,</a> all you're keeping open is the conversations you're going to be able to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6577.09s">That's</a> what the resolution would say. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6578.411s">So</a> I would be willing to. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6581.133s">That</a> doesn't make sense to me, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6582.574s">Oh,</a> why doesn't it? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6583.115s">I</a> have some amendments that I'd like to put forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6585.977s">Well,</a> then this will be tremendously amended then. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6588.939s">Well,</a> whether it's amended or not, what difference does it make? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6591.101s">It's</a> part of the ongoing discussion, Fred. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6593.162s">It's</a> all there is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6593.663s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6638.094s">No,</a> just table it until you get the answer.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6723.748s">We've</a> had many resolutions that are amended on the floor.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6731.051s">With</a> a number on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6731.511s">And</a> then I said, as amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6733.052s">As</a> amended, and I handed it to him.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6747.417s">Let's</a> withdraw it and see how the answer is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6749.467s">Before</a> we go any further, before we get to that, I want to go back to the amendments that we're discussing here right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6755.048s">I</a> want to go to indicate that on, is Mr. Nash, you're still here? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6760.67s">Dan.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6770.812s">Are</a> the cars, the two cars that you have right now, are they lettered yet properly? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6774.613s">Are</a> they done? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6775.393s">Pardon</a> me? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6775.953s">Nope.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6777.214s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6777.654s">And</a> have they been used? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6779.167s">recently</a> for the purposes of issuing tickets? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6782.708s">Nope.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6783.389s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6784.229s">And</a> when we met, I believe it was on this past Friday, you indicated that the cars would not be used for that particular purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6790.412s">They</a> would just be driving your drivers around and they would be getting out and doing what they're doing.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6798.215s">I</a> move that the dates of January 15th and January 16th, any tickets and issued <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6805.387s">You</a> amend the amended further with another amendment, further amended by Councilor Penta that the tickets issued on the January 15th and especially January 15th where the cars were unlicensed, unregistered and unserved checked and unleaded, uh, not be, uh, be waived. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6824.021s">And</a> same thing for the 16th. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6826.963s">Um,</a> and also number two, there was no clarity into what you just said. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6830.886s">Councilor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6831.347s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6832.027s">You</a> can't understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6833.872s">And</a> the 16th, the same for the 15th and the 16th. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6836.636s">Any</a> tickets that they issued be invalid, because they were used in a car that wasn't properly marked, insured, registered, and inspected.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6854.155s">What</a> day were they insured, Dan? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6855.435s">I</a> don't have that documentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6856.256s">You</a> don't have it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6863.219s">You</a> had a cardboard plate that said Tennessee on the back of a white car that did not have a Massachusetts registration. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6869.801s">It</a> wasn't inspected. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6870.982s">And</a> it wasn't leaded and identified. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6872.763s">That's</a> what the contract says you were supposed to do.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6878.903s">Therefore,</a> with that being said, tickets given on those two days, and they're still unalerted vehicles, but I understand what he's doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6886.108s">They're</a> just driving the people around. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6887.629s">So</a> the tickets that were given on those two days be waived. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6890.531s">That's</a> all.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6928.381s">But</a> you had to use that vehicle, Dan, to get to where you were going. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6930.983s">If</a> the chief of police drove down the street and saw my car that was uninspected, unregistered, and didn't have a Massachusetts plate on it for the purposes of an unleaded, he would stop me and give me a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6943.309s">He</a> didn't have it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6950.526s">Well,</a> you would have not been able to get the information, Dan, from the orange things on top of those vehicles from the guys driving down the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6957.087s">Correct?</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7010.238s">But</a> Dan, he would have never been able to do whatever those violations were on that, at least on the 15th, on the 15th, if he didn't have, if the car was properly, it was like it was supposed to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7019.164s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7020.365s">We</a> could have.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7077.394s">On</a> that matter, how can you override something without coming to City Hall? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7083.178s">You</a> can do that where you're at? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7085.219s">Well,</a> with your permission, I'll do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7086.7s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7086.78s">I</a> don't know which way you want me to do it, and you don't want me to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7089.321s">I</a> hope the council agrees to give permission to avoid the tickets, OK? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7095.266s">the</a> council is not authorized to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7097.047s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7097.428s">But</a> he can do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7098.649s">Second</a> thing on the tickets, is there any way instead of having a paper ticket, you can put a color ticket on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7104.374s">Um,</a> yes, that's already been brought up in work. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7106.836s">But</a> I just want to know, cause it's not part of the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7109.898s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7110.178s">I</a> like to make a part of the, there are a couple of solutions to that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7114.582s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7114.762s">I</a> like to amend it that the, the, the violations be color coded. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7118.245s">So,</a> and not, and not in paper council and not on paper.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7183.719s">Last</a> two points, to get it corrected, because this is the question that was asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7188.581s">Once</a> you give a ticket and somebody appeals the ticket, do they have to pay the ticket first or do they have the appeal and after the appeal it's taking place? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7196.765s">No,</a> they do not have to pay the ticket first. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7197.965s">They</a> do not have to pay the ticket in advance. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7199.706s">And</a> the last thing, Chief, did you realize on the ticket they have the word officer? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7203.087s">Why</a> are they using the word officer? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7205.912s">Can</a> that word be changed?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7209.914s">It</a> says officer on it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7218.279s">Anyone</a> see the words officer gives a representation of a police officer, and they're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7222.321s">They're</a> not supposed to give anything that represents the city of Medford Fire, Police, or any type of representation.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7268.603s">No,</a> I think the urge is to have, after 90 days, they should have been prepared for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7273.565s">That's</a> the urge.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7275.886s">Well,</a> they had them for 30 days.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7278.647s">Chief,</a> they had 90 days to get them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7280.888s">They</a> said it in their contract, 90 days, Fred. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7283.109s">90</a> days. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7284.99s">I</a> amend the motion that the word officer be replaced on the tickets.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7296.929s">And</a> also that the ticket, if somebody gets a ticket, it's color coded. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7300.349s">And</a> would you say with the return address envelope?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7440.456s">So</a> let's wrap it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7444.378s">Wait</a> a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7445.778s">You</a> want to rush? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7446.518s">Relax.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7448.079s">This</a> is too important of an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7449.48s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7450.56s">Number</a> one, after seven o'clock at night, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7453.623s">Dan,</a> you indicated that you're going to have a special team go out after seven o'clock at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7457.784s">What</a> does it say that in the contract?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7524.885s">I</a> understand the seven to seven, but I don't understand how they can work after seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7529.027s">I</a> mean, and as far as their, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7531.177s">financial</a> windfall that comes out of all of that, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7533.499s">And</a> number two, how are you going to read in the dock? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7535.2s">How</a> are they going to read number plates in the dock?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7541.785s">But</a> when cars are parked close together, Chief, what are they going to get out of the car?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7563.863s">I</a> think it was mentioned at the Committee of the Whole meeting that it cost about $30,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7566.885s">Is</a> that what it is for those things to be on top of those cars? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7570.167s">Is</a> that what it is, Dan?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7590.305s">Well,</a> since we have approximately $7 million in free cash, I'm going to move that the city's police department be afforded an opportunity to investigate what the cost would be to install them in your cruises.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7626.255s">In</a> the effort to eliminate redundancy, why don't we withdraw that amendment? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=7628.777s">No,</a> I'm going to put it on there as an amendment.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9138.324s">Yeah,</a> Jane, the thing that I appreciate the fact is you put a lot of effort and time <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9143.302s">and</a> making a presentation of what you thought you believed in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9145.483s">You</a> know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9146.023s">But</a> the city has a responsibility, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9147.844s">So</a> this is where I'm going to digress from Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9150.145s">I</a> don't think you have to go out there and start and do anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9152.846s">We</a> have a community development office who's yet to even walk these streets here in the city of Medford to find out a knock on the business doors, like the mayor, failing to find out what's going on, what's the problem, what do you think would be a better situation here for the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9168.473s">What</a> would you like to see to be done? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9170.118s">So</a> with that being said, I think the city has a big obligation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9173.82s">It's</a> bad enough they're taxing people to death with food tax, and sales tax, and excise tax, and water and sewer tax, and real estate tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9181.624s">And</a> now you have this new crazy kiosk tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9186.326s">And</a> now you want the business people to go ahead and create something that the city should be doing themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9191.829s">If</a> they want development to take place, if they wanted to be proactive, they'd be out there, just like Summerville was proactive, just like Winchester's proactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9199.376s">just</a> like Arlington is proactive, just like Lexington is proactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9203.46s">We</a> don't have to be those communities, but we can be proactive between and amongst ourselves within our own communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9209.723s">And</a> a lot of people look at West Mefford, you happen to mention it, so I'll mention West Mefford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9213.865s">It's</a> a close-knit group of people, they work together, they look out for each other, and it's a type of business where one feeds off of another. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9222.268s">They're</a> not Newbury Street, it's just a mom and pop type of community within our own city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9228.271s">But</a> all four sections of the city are like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9230.332s">Mefford</a> Square is different. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9231.752s">All</a> four sections of the city are like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9233.727s">And</a> once the city wakes up and decides to figure out that they need to fix potholes, they need to understand that business people need to survive, and they can't keep taxing them to that, especially when you're sitting on almost $15 million of revenue surplus and a water and sewer account and free cash, and now you're trying to tax them again with this craziness of a kiosk tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9254.615s">It's</a> wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9255.055s">In</a> my opinion, it's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9256.416s">I</a> think the city needs to wake up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9258.118s">And</a> it's obvious that the mayor, listen, if the mayor had any respect for this council and for you, he would have sent somebody, he would have sent something to the president of this council and told them, unfortunately, I'm not going to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9268.16s">I'm</a> on vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9269.56s">Could</a> you please cancel the meeting for another week? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9271.48s">But</a> no, he didn't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9273.201s">He</a> knew in advance, they knew in advance he wasn't going to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9276.121s">It</a> was a wasted night, unfortunately, for all the people that showed up, but hopefully the chief got the message and got the idea that there were still concerns out there that need to be corrected. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9284.423s">And</a> I stand by my resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9286.164s">And</a> when I introduce it next week, I do not support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9288.946s">Because</a> I do not think it's right for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9291.007s">It's</a> not the right step to go in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9292.447s">And</a> I think it should have started with the city taking on the responsibility first before we do anything by bringing in an outside company. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9298.911s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9476.093s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9477.234s">Yeah,</a> Jean, don't go away, because my opinion is going to be a little different than Councilor Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9481.838s">I</a> wish he mentioned me by name, because that's who I know he was referring to. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9484.861s">But</a> I think government does have a role. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9486.221s">I</a> think government has a responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9487.942s">When</a> they tax the people in this community, or in any community, to do something and to be part of the community, they have a responsibility to go out there and work within the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9496.223s">And</a> when you don't see them, and when you don't hear from them, and when you see businesses closing down one at a time, one at a time, and one at a time in Medford Square, and you still not see city government going out there trying to find out what the problem is, what the reason is, that's the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9509.766s">It's</a> government not doing its job. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9512.166s">You</a> can do all the job you want to help out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9514.047s">It's</a> commendable. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9515.188s">But</a> you still need government to help you out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9516.848s">And</a> if you don't want government to help you out, then you shouldn't even be standing here tonight, because it won't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9522.37s">It</a> takes two to tango. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9523.69s">But</a> before it takes two to tango, we have to remember one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9526.511s">Jim</a> Silver and Smartco and South Metro, it was because of those people being persistent, being persistent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9535.933s">Because</a> if the city was doing its job, he wouldn't have had to been so persistent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9541.234s">And</a> thankfully, the chief was there on a particular night <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9543.991s">And</a> he walked the neighborhood with them to see what was going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9546.772s">He</a> is an exemplary person as a municipal employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9550.914s">If</a> all the department heads acted like him, we'd have no problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9553.755s">You</a> wouldn't even need a mayor because everybody would be doing their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9556.897s">The</a> guy goes over and beyond the call of duty. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9559.398s">This</a> is not his job, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9560.919s">His</a> job is to be the chief of police, to make sure our community is safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9564.68s">He</a> should not have to be the parking commissioner, so to speak, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9569.382s">But</a> unfortunately, the mayor <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9572.401s">God</a> bless you chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9573.342s">Why</a> are you doing it? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9574.443s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9575.604s">I</a> don't think you deserve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9577.345s">And</a> I just think there's a perfect example of government not being responsible for what they're supposed to be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9583.25s">This</a> is the mayor's program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9585.572s">This</a> is the mayor's program, not the chief or the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9587.914s">This</a> is the mayor's program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9589.315s">And</a> if he wants to go on vacation for which he's entitled to, then we should have been given the respect that he wasn't going to be here tonight by the people in his office who knew he wasn't going to be here because everybody that showed up early tonight expected him to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9601.375s">And</a> that's the message that went out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9602.677s">And</a> that was the vote of the city council last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9604.9s">Seven,</a> seven to nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9606.403s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10576.365s">Yeah,</a> it's interesting because this Medford city council was in the forefront of wanting to be a surrounding community contender right from the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10585.468s">And</a> I think there is maybe five to six resolutions that were offered on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10589.889s">Myself</a> included along with council Longo current as it related to getting ourselves on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10594.965s">And</a> the interesting part about all of this, I think we sent resolutions to the Mass Gaming Commission, and I believe we also sent one to the Commonwealth of Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10602.99s">I</a> think it was the Attorney General's Office that needed to go there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10607.073s">Bottom</a> line to all of that is we had asked the mayor on numerous occasions to be part of the surrounding community application. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10615.058s">Not</a> only did he ignore us, but he also went forward and did whatever he did to subsequently reach, I think it was $250,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10623.085s">and</a> money thus far from the Wynn Casino group of people who made the application to the Mass Gaming Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10629.45s">Putting</a> all of that aside, we now have a situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10632.952s">We</a> have, and I don't know if this is called mitigation money, I don't know what the proper terminology is, but if we have the ability to have $100,000 come to us, whether it be for use for the Wellington area, whether it's the First Street, whether it's for flooding. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10645.542s">Once</a> again, I'd like to amend the motion that the mayor consult with the council as it relates <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10651.413s">for</a> the purposes of using this money. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10653.635s">There's</a> no sense in you being on the committee, Rick, that the mayor just appointed you to, if the money is going to wind up going for whatever he wants to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10660.68s">All</a> you are going to be doing is a conduit to bring the money into the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10664.703s">And</a> again, it's another example, if the mayor doesn't want to participate with the council in our request, then it's for naught. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10670.487s">We're</a> just giving him carte blanche to do whatever he wants whenever he gets this money.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10684.467s">We'll</a> make the specific thing for the Wellington neighborhood, whether it's for the rotary intersection or to decrease the water.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10693.114s">Well,</a> the multiple issues got to come from the council.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10699.318s">We're</a> talking about this $100,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10700.039s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10700.399s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10700.639s">What</a> do you want it to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10703.201s">Councilman,</a> you brought it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10704.422s">What</a> is your suggestion? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10706.543s">Mike?</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10767.422s">February</a> 2nd is right around the corner.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10772.264s">Well,</a> the council resolution go forward as amended.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10845.271s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10846.531s">Point</a> of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10847.291s">Councilor</a> Marks, I mean, Councilor Knight, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10849.926s">brings</a> up an interesting point, but the city some years ago did apply for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10853.507s">And</a> they put a request in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10854.847s">I</a> think it was for, I think it was almost $80,000, $90,000 at one time for the purposes of having a transportation, I won't use the word consultant, a transportation person upstairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10864.93s">And</a> I think we got the idea because of what Somerville was doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10867.711s">And</a> at that point in time, I believe Somerville had 14 people in their office of community development and how they were getting so efficient is they hired an outside professional person <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10875.57s">to</a> be their transportation consultant. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10877.592s">I</a> think that's one of the people that made the takeoff of the piece of property over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10881.274s">I've</a> got no problem supporting them there, but these are all, I think, budgetary issues, because if you take that money from the $100,000, you've got to keep that position going each and every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10892.664s">I</a> like the idea of bringing it up again, but I think it's just, you know, I think it's just something that this whole budget has to be looked at as to where we're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10900.249s">Each</a> and every year we wind up in the last four years with a million dollar surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10904.392s">So</a> we know that there is money there to hire additional people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10907.595s">The</a> school committee just got an additional two and a half million dollars this year, and they've hired many more administrators, more than we've able to do on this side of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10916.001s">So</a> something's got to make the turn. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10918.207s">that</a> gets to where you're talking about, Councilor Knight, what Councilor Marks was talking about, where this city should be moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10924.291s">Everybody's</a> moving forward around us, and all we're doing is just staying still and becoming stagnant, and that's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10930.575s">It</a> shouldn't be that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10931.896s">We're</a> not a poor city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10933.477s">We</a> are financially endowed right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10935.758s">We</a> have good money, and we should be investing it in good projects, not just keep increasing, taxing the people, and just keeping the coffers, and just filling them up and filling them up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10946.385s">It</a> just doesn't work that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10948.079s">And</a> our best example is our sister city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10950.281s">Just</a> look at Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10951.141s">Years</a> ago, people... Years ago, I wouldn't want to move to Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10955.284s">Now,</a> you can't even get into Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10957.525s">You</a> can't even touch the real estate in Somerville.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_pC-1P_58AJk/2025-03-21_pC-1P_58AJk.html">Medford City Council - January 13, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=177.501s">On</a> that account, I agree with my colleague of having that done, but I think we've, we've been talking about this for almost a year and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=184.305s">And</a> I believe in the year 2014, while you were serving as president, and that was the number one priority of the Medford city council to have an account or something that would basically relegate itself toward addressing a police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=196.392s">I</a> know we have the chief of police here tonight, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=198.622s">I</a> know he would welcome that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=200.123s">I</a> know that the members of the, uh, method police department would welcome it, but it still has to come from the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=204.885s">And</a> I just really wouldn't want this to be, um, some type of a, um, lip service going forward without having some kind of an agreement that money would be put aside on an annual basis or that we would put a yearly program together. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=218.493s">And</a> maybe by the end of the third year, the money would be there rather than waiting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=221.935s">As</a> the mayor has alluded to, it'll be seven years before, and he's not going to be here in seven years. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=225.917s">We</a> all know that, you know, thank God. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=228.045s">So</a> with that being said, I think maybe a redirection as to not only setting up the account, but maybe taking a dollar amount, making a request to take a dollar amount, either out of our free cash or on the stabilization account, as we did to take money out of the account of our deficit as it relates to our retirement fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=250.017s">It's</a> in a total deficit. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=252.038s">And</a> we've asked to take each on an annual basis of $500,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=255.757s">to</a> at least start the ball rolling. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=257.318s">The</a> mayor is yet to respond from that, because it's obvious that it's not on his plate to be thinking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=263.341s">And</a> I agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=264.562s">I</a> think something needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=265.922s">I</a> would rather put a dollar amount from a budgetary item in here to tell the mayor that we're serious about doing this, or your resolution is serious, rather than just making a request. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=278.629s">So</a> I would up the anti-jar resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=281.998s">To</a> pick an account, take a dollar amount that we know we have over $7 million in free cash, we could take something out of there to get the ball rolling.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=383.927s">I</a> have no problem putting a dollar amount in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=386.849s">We</a> have other buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=387.71s">I</a> mean, we can just look at that building right up here in City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=390.532s">This</a> has been going on for well over two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=393.093s">Now</a> what they did is they've covered the hole in the ceiling rather than fix the hole in the ceiling. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=397.824s">And</a> as part of the frame that goes around, it's still ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=401.506s">We</a> don't know whether it's going to come down or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=403.087s">We</a> can go to the public library, and we can look at the public library and look at the thousands of dollars that's needed over there in the public library. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=410.091s">Councilor</a> Caraviello, when he first came on, I think it was on his 11th month, he gave us a paper that had $1.2 million worth of needed repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=418.551s">and</a> the new schools within our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=420.672s">And</a> during this past year, the schools, the city council passes a budget that gives an increase of over $2 million to the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=427.316s">And</a> what do they do? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=427.996s">They</a> add more administrators and to an overgrowing need. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=432.478s">Maybe</a> that doesn't even need to be needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=434.079s">Maybe</a> we ought to be looking at teachers and more classroom things that are necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=438.001s">So</a> the stabilization account, I've got no problem with that council, but I'd rather prioritize that because the council did make an agreement in January of last year, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=447.691s">that</a> the police station will be their first priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=449.373s">I</a> mean, I'm assuming that the council is still on board for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=453.016s">Maybe</a> we should ask the Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=454.197s">I</a> mean, what's your priority? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=455.658s">Is</a> it the police department or is it just for all municipal buildings as needed when needed?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=913.137s">Well,</a> two points. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=914.398s">I</a> think everybody has a whole host of good ideas over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=916.819s">Um,</a> I can see two points happening here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=919.041s">Uh,</a> the history of the city for the last four years at the end of each and every year is accumulated a surplus of approximately a million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=926.485s">So</a> each and every year we've had close to a million dollars, anywhere from nine 70 to over a million, a million one that gets itself certified and free cash as a result of the end of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=935.587s">Now,</a> if I follow what Councilor Knight has alluded to by maybe taking a percentage, maybe we can take an idea, following what you are saying, Councilor Camuso, put a dollar in to start it, and then take a percentage, maybe one, two, or three percent of whatever the surplus is going to be at the end of the year before free cash comes in, and that way you're not taxing the people because you know at the end of the year there's a surplus that it's not the people who are not going to have to pay for. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=958.763s">That</a> would be one way of moving the money around without having to <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=963.597s">put</a> a separate account as Council Mark said a little too because he's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=966.018s">It's</a> going to come from the taxpayers one way or the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=968.46s">So</a> if in fact we're fortunate or the taxpayers pay enough into paying their taxes into the city and for whatever reason is unfortunately or fortunately each and every year in June we have a surplus certified by the Department of Revenue close to over a million dollars and that's how we get our accumulation of over seven million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=986.971s">It</a> was almost seven and a half, eight million dollars for which the mayor this past I believe November <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=991.356s">presented</a> before the council a whole host of issues for which we voted $1.23 million from free cash to satisfy those requests that he had, which leaves us with approximately $7 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1002.802s">So</a> I've got no problem creating the count. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1005.384s">That's</a> all I want to do at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1006.464s">But</a> to fund the account, I think it should come from the surplus, if any, in any particular year that the city council ends its fiscal year, June 30th, and whatever is certified as a remainder in free cash by the Department of Revenue <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1020.428s">and</a> I think Councilor Lungo was right, maybe we should just go to a Committee of the Whole and come up with a percentage of whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1027.012s">Following</a> Councilor Marks' commentary, the Mayor's gonna be on board with this, and if he's not gonna be on board, you know, I mean, he doesn't talk to us about anything, so this is gonna be something that's gonna have to be creatively done between and amongst ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1040.021s">So</a> I would support your resolution, putting a dollar in there, a dollar in there, on the condition that we have a Committee of the Whole meeting for the purposes of deciding <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1049.908s">How</a> we're going to maintain or put the money into that account, my choice, preference would be whatever the surplus is at the end of the year, certified by the Department of Revenue and Free Cash, then we have to decide amongst ourselves, 1%, 2%, 3%, whatever it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1063.151s">That's</a> a no cost to the taxpayer at that point in time, and at least it gets ourselves going, whether it's for a police department, whether it's for City Hall, or for whether it's the $1.2 million in school repairs that are necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1073.814s">It</a> needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1075.002s">There's</a> no question about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1076.382s">So</a> that would be my amendment to the resolution.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1091.745s">I'm</a> amending his resolution to say that I will support it to put a dollar in there.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1102.346s">The</a> council is going to have to vote on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1104.009s">It's</a> an amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1104.61s">It's</a> his resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1105.652s">We</a> have a resolution.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1316.566s">Before</a> we get the, before we even get into that, I think it needs to be understood that one of the reasons why we're doing this is because of a police station possibility issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1324.953s">or</a> of our public library, or our municipal buildings, or our school department buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1330.056s">I</a> mean, we have a whole host of issues here that taxpayers are paying for on a daily, annual, weekly basis here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1335.978s">So</a> my resolution is to establish, and it also is recommending to the mayor, establishing a stabilization account for the purposes of reviewing our municipal buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1349.005s">I</a> would like the idea of putting the priority with a police station first. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1351.966s">I</a> mean, you can do what you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1353.817s">And</a> then go to a committee of the whole meeting for the purposes of how are we going to recommend further to the mayor where the monies would come from. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1363.905s">And</a> if we follow it, Councilor Marks is alluded to providing it doesn't come out of the everyday tax payers rate because we're dealing with surplus clarification, council, vice president.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1382.161s">But</a> what do you have? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1382.721s">Tell</a> me what you have, Mr. Quirk.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1386.582s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1387.062s">It</a> says the same thing.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1415.334s">Well,</a> I'm assuming, but I think council, the intent of this is few municipal buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1422.237s">I'm</a> assuming that's your priority here.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1518.836s">But</a> the council has made recommendations in the past, not a stabilization account. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1522.547s">but</a> for revolving accounts for which the administration has adopted.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1937.494s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1937.995s">Once</a> approved, following the language that's written, followed by a committee of the whole meeting, roll call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1943.159s">And</a> you have that almost a clip.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2312.429s">Could</a> the clerk read the motion out loud, please, as amended?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2360.289s">And,</a> uh, it's not, no, no, that wasn't what I said. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2363.749s">Went</a> to a committee, the whole meeting, you know, it's all, why don't you just refer to a committee that passed the main motion and delete as a police station and refer it to the committee, the whole meeting of the council come up with a criteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2373.991s">So</a> moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2375.271s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2377.112s">Your</a> motion minusing out the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2379.382s">and</a> we're referring it to what can be the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2381.563s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2382.143s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2400.17s">Also</a> in the meantime, Council Max, he wanted to find out if in fact you're going to report back to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2405.883s">If</a> there already is an established stabilization account. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2408.003s">The</a> clerk will report back to us.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2424.907s">Make</a> that part of the paper.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2601.08s">Mr.</a> President, last week we had a four hour <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2603.903s">marathon</a> discussion as it related to the mayor's new pay to park enhancement program here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2610.827s">And</a> as we all know, there was a full host of folks here, approximately 50 people who were involved, who had a personal interest in this particular program, came. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2620.051s">Many</a> of them spoke. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2621.032s">A</a> lot of people came to listen as to what was going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2623.733s">As</a> a result of that, there were many concerns that were brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2628.876s">Unfortunately,</a> I don't think the local press has been able to pick up on all of it yet and their commentaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2634.123s">That's</a> neither here or there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2635.983s">Some</a> concerns from last week to this week have developed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2639.944s">And</a> I know the chief of police is here, and I know there was some continuation of changes that took place at the traffic commission today. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2647.185s">But</a> I have some particular issues since last week till now that I would like to bring up. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2652.946s">The</a> first one is the fact that this was supposed to be a major program here in the city of Medford, a major development <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2662.038s">that</a> would have an impact on the taxpayers of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2665.261s">But</a> if you'll notice very nicely, there was no ribbon cutting ceremony for this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2669.524s">You</a> didn't see a whole host of people coming out into the city while the mayor cut the ribbon for this wonderful new tax me to death program. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2677.871s">You</a> didn't see that, and you won't see it either. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2680.733s">And</a> last week, Mr. Chief, when you were here, two particular locations, one in West Method on High Street in front of a couple of residential homes, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2689.544s">And</a> on Boston Avenue, in front of a bunch of residential homes, those kiosks are still there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2694.647s">And</a> the 15th is two days away. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2697.088s">And</a> if I understood everybody's comments last week, not only yours, but also the folks from Republic, they indicated that those were going to be taken away and removed because they were misplaced or whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2710.496s">Thirdly,</a> talking about the location where you go to get your parking permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2718.947s">As</a> of yesterday, from folks that I have spoken to, maybe it came in today's mail, but people who sent their applications in on the 1st of January, or the first week of January, looking for their resident parking permit, they have still to get in the mail the two passes for guests, whoever it might be, coming to their homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2737.974s">And</a> also, when they went to pay, they didn't get a receipt. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2740.294s">So</a> if any of you folks out there did pay, didn't get a receipt, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2744.156s">But</a> for the two particular folks from both parts of the city that went there, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2748.462s">They</a> went out there, and they got no receipt. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2752.003s">A</a> major concern is if it's not here in City Hall anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2756.803s">You</a> can't come to City Hall and buy your resident parking permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2760.324s">You</a> have to go to the spot on Main Street on the Somerville Line. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2764.265s">And</a> to do that, you have to pay $10, same thing that you would have paid here in City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2770.186s">But</a> they're telling you, if you have a smartphone or whatever, or your computer, you can go online, and you can get it that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2777.387s">But</a> of course, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2778.368s">They</a> extort another 30% out of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2780.609s">They</a> charge you $3 more to do it that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2783.329s">So</a> by doing it that way, they're making another 30% on the fact that you're a resident of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2789.751s">You</a> want to get a resident parking sticker for where you park, where you pay taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2793.852s">And</a> now they want to charge you 30% for the sticker that normally costs 10%. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2798.694s">Also,</a> a validation program was brought to our attention last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2803.815s">And</a> it started off by addressing certain hairdressers in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2807.945s">One</a> in particular in the West Medford area. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2810.889s">And</a> as a result of that, as we all know, a lot of these hairdressers have senior citizens and maybe younger folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2817.376s">But</a> a majority of the senior citizens that come there, they have a two or three hour window to do what they have to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2823.724s">So</a> the questions become, as I'm going around to six of them now I've gone to, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2827.95s">And</a> as I go to them, I mean, what are they supposed to do, get them off the chair, run outside? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2831.573s">They</a> can't move the car because you only can stay there for two hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2835.316s">But</a> they want to know how a particular hairdresser in a particular part of this community can get a special validation program so that person can give out numbers and number plates to the Republic people so on a particular day, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2850.65s">They</a> won't tag those people. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2851.791s">I</a> mean, this is absolute insanity on a particular day. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2854.292s">What</a> are we going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2855.133s">Play</a> this game one day, one day at a time? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2857.654s">Let</a> one hairdresser know and another hairdresser not know? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2860.356s">There's</a> no fairness to that part of the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2863.398s">Also,</a> nothing has been presented to us that tells us there is a statutory law that allows a private for-profit out-of-state company to issue parking citations, which has historically been a police department job. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2878.187s">That's</a> a big issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2880.208s">And</a> I know, Chief, you may not have the answer for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2882.709s">But</a> I'll tell you this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2884.491s">If</a> you do have the answer for that, then I think what you need to have presented before here is that your Metro Police Department took a vote to give up that part of their job to a private nonprofit out-of-state company. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2896.338s">People</a> want to know that, and I want to know that, too, because that's a huge issue in this whole program. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2903.102s">Last</a> week, it was Councilor Knight who brought up the issue of the signs in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2907.464s">There's</a> a contract that says, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2909.287s">Republic</a> will replace and paint the signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2912.27s">Rightfully</a> so. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2913.411s">It's</a> part of the job that the Medford highway department have. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2917.134s">And</a> if the mayor abdicated that responsibility away from the highway department, then he violated his own contract with his own employees here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2926.602s">And</a> it's as clear as the bell. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2928.203s">And</a> I think it's in a section three of the RFP that went out this past spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2933.472s">So</a> these are a few issues that are going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2935.894s">We're</a> not a poor community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2937.435s">This</a> is the funny part about this thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2939.837s">You're</a> sitting on huge surpluses of money, $7 million in free cash, $8.5 million in water and sewer, and just on the water and sewer account. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2946.962s">Your</a> water and sewer account bills just went up, and you're sitting on $8.5 million of your money that you keep paying more and more in each and every year, whether you have a stabilization account, a surplus account, whatever it might be, or your real estate account. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2960.531s">This</a> is a program. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2962.117s">that</a> had absolutely no thought process generated out to the entire community, never mind the business people, but the taxpayers of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2972.2s">This</a> past Saturday, if you drove through Medford Square, as I did, and I walked through it, and you go through the downtown areas of West Medford and South Medford and North Medford, and you will start to see people not going into these stores. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2986.084s">So</a> I go and ask some of these proprietors, why? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2987.825s">Because</a> they're not going to go in there for five minutes, go in there to pick up a cup of coffee, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2991.968s">or</a> get a sandwich and put $0.25 in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2994.149s">And</a> if they can't get a spot there, they have to go look for a, what do you call it, a kiosk. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2999.931s">And</a> by the time they go to the kiosk and come back, and if they use a smartphone, pay $0.35 to put $0.25 into the machine. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3006.514s">So</a> now you're up to $0.60 for 15 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3009.735s">It</a> makes no sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3011.515s">Republic</a> comes from Tennessee. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3013.256s">They're</a> here for only one reason, and that's to make money. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3016.297s">They're</a> not your friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3017.258s">They're</a> not our friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3018.458s">Their</a> only friend is your money that you put into that machine. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3021.522s">So</a> good luck to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3022.584s">They</a> won the bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3023.565s">The</a> mayor won the bid with him. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3025.623s">But</a> the other part of the program is, if you're all going to be treated equally, then everyone that works in this city, in this building, the fire department, police department, school department, your parking spot that you get in this city is what you consider a perk. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3039.97s">It</a> doesn't go with your job. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3041.991s">Now,</a> he's opened up Pandora's box because there's an IRS rule and regulation that allows a perk. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3049.674s">If</a> you're getting a perk on your job, which is parking, there's a cost factor that goes along with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3055.192s">And</a> right now, as of the IRS rule and regulation as of 2014, it's up to $250 a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3061.555s">And</a> the crazy part about the whole story is up to $250 a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3065.476s">So</a> if an employee in this building comes here, we're now going to have to figure out what is the value of that free parking spot that they get here on this piece of property. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3075.182s">But</a> if you take a train or a bus to Boston every day, you get $130 a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3080.727s">So</a> where's the logic in between there of wanting to take cars off the road and use public transportation when they're giving you a higher perk for your job to park your car on an employer's location, which is the city of Medford, as compared to taking a train from the private industry? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3097.032s">Those</a> are some of my comments right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3100.276s">It's</a> just, this is just so hard to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3105.403s">And</a> the poor part, the hard part about it is, you know, I know every business wants to make a go of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3111.447s">But</a> you can't have competition in one part of the city and not be addressed the same way equally in another part. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3116.688s">You</a> can't go to a market in one part of the city, and you can sit there all day long and go to another part of the city and go to a convenience store, and you get a 15, 30-minute parking spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3127.07s">As</a> I said to you last week, Chief, with all due respect, in South Medford, you have 15 minutes, you have 30 minutes, you have one hour and two-hour parking, all in the same block of stores. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3136.412s">Now,</a> that's hard to understand, and if you're going to try to treat everyone the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3142.053s">Last</a> week, one of the things that did resonate, I will tell you this, it's dark out right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3145.716s">You</a> go outside after 4.30, 5 o'clock at night, and you're driving down the street, and you're not used to what a kiosk is, or you can't find it, you can't see it, or the weather isn't clement, or whatever it might be, and there's snow. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3158.426s">Either</a> you're going to lose the customer, or they're not going to find the kiosk and get tagged, or more importantly, the city's going to have an obligation, because in your RFP in there, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3168.49s">I</a> believe the question was asked, I think it was you, Councilor Caraviello, asked the question, when it snows out, who is gonna be the responsible party to make sure that those kiosks are clean on the sidewalk for somebody to get to? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3180.937s">So</a> those are some of my initial comments, Chief, and as I said to you again, this is the Chief of Police, and I happen to like him, and he's my friend, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3188.921s">But</a> he doesn't deserve to be up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3190.862s">It's</a> not his program. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3192.403s">It's</a> Mayor Michael McGlynn's program. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3194.303s">He's</a> the one that should be here answering the questions, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3197.543s">And</a> I know you're doing the job for him, Chief, but I just think it's unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3200.644s">That's</a> just my opinion, and I'm saying it publicly. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3203.065s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Penta.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3338.733s">There's</a> just two of them in front of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3341.028s">It's</a> one in front of the apartment building and one in front of the two family house.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3497.169s">Let's</a> go back to West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3498.49s">You</a> said 418 High Street, where the residents are. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3501.112s">But</a> you can go right across the street, and there's a kiosk that's in front of a house that's residential on the top floor, a dentist off on the bottom, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3508.988s">And</a> there's two residential there, and then there's a funeral home. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3511.55s">And</a> there's one before the funeral home, and there's one after. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3514.132s">Now,</a> we won't get into naming other funeral homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3516.493s">There's</a> other funeral homes that have nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3518.375s">And</a> you can park there all day. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3519.615s">I</a> mean, how does this work?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3566.005s">We're</a> not talking about generalities. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3567.266s">I</a> think the chief knows what I'm talking about, and I think Mr. Nash knows what I'm talking about, because we've had this discussion before, and nothing has changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3574.789s">Nothing</a> has changed for the locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3577.051s">And</a> as a result of that, we're taking a like subject matter, a funeral home. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3582.613s">How</a> come in one part of the city there's nothing and another part of the city there is? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3585.935s">We</a> can go to convenience stores and do the same argument. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3588.436s">We've</a> already done it with hairdressers.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3607.55s">But</a> who checked the report? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3609.311s">Why</a> would you put something in front of a residential home? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3611.352s">Where's</a> the logic to that?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3678.574s">I</a> hear what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3680.282s">How</a> do you justify, if the contract was signed on October 10th, and this is now January, what, 13th? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3686.306s">They</a> had three months. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3687.707s">They</a> had three months to look at all these locations and saying, hey, wait a minute, this doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3692.17s">Why</a> would you put something here in front of a house? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3694.312s">How</a> would you take one business and put it in front of one business and not another business? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3698.675s">And</a> then I think you made the comment last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3700.656s">that</a> this is just the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3701.996s">There's</a> going to be more to come as it relates to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3704.337s">I</a> mean, if this is just the beginning now, what's going to happen when you start hitting all these other locations? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3709.099s">You</a> can go from Salem Street, outside of Salem Street, all the way down to Medford Square, and there's nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=3714.32s">There's</a> nothing on the streets there.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4141.142s">Just</a> a point of further clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4142.343s">I</a> agree with Councilor Camuso, you know, and it's right, we can agree to disagree. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4146.347s">It</a> was never brought before us, but have a member of the Mayor's staff go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4150.531s">That's</a> just absolutely crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4152.63s">Further</a> to the nonsense to all of this is the man behind our backs went and sought out one of our local state representatives and filed and had him file the transportation bill, $8 million to build the garage. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4164.853s">And</a> we knew nothing about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4166.794s">The</a> city knew nothing about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4167.874s">The</a> council knew nothing about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4169.174s">It</a> was a sneaky way to do an end run. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4170.755s">Point</a> of information made. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4172.617s">clear,</a> Mr. President, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4174.538s">This</a> is very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4175.339s">He</a> brought up a very important issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4177.12s">If</a> this council is getting tagged for something that they never did, then it needs to be explained why they never did what they're being tagged for, because it was never presented before us.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4431.851s">Council</a> Penta when you say 25 spots, seniors only senior center use only senior center. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4438.894s">So</a> where do they get these? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4439.914s">Where</a> do they have to get these permits?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4632.641s">Can</a> you go back to the parking lot, the back wall, the big parking lot?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4900.549s">Yeah,</a> you had to be down South Met for the other day, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4903.731s">When</a> they had two of those so-called ambassadors arguing with people, people telling the people they had to put the money into the META. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4910.934s">Councilor</a> Caraviello, I think you're aware of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4913.455s">Yes,</a> sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4914.175s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4915.496s">So</a> don't say they weren't. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4917.197s">They</a> weren't. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4917.657s">They</a> weren't telling people they had to put the money into the META, and that is absolutely false. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=4923.18s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Penta.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6270.326s">Point</a> of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6271.307s">Point</a> of clarification, counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6273.912s">on</a> that exact question. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6274.973s">So</a> if I'm a business merchant, take West Method, for example, and I have three employees, and I won't park in front because I want to turn it over, but I'm going to go park on the parking lot behind, and it's only a three-hour window. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6289.342s">But</a> if they have a business permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6291.204s">So</a> each one of them has to pay $100 for a business permit?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6308.459s">Excuse</a> me.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6310.4s">So</a> you're going to tell me that they're going to have to pay $100 there because they work at a particular store. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6317.866s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6318.226s">Is</a> that what you're saying? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6318.927s">Everyone's</a> treated the same because you haven't addressed that yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6321.669s">And</a> I can park down the end of governor's, I mean, playstate road on the Winchester line there by the for $5 a day, take a bus and go to Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6329.695s">What</a> makes them any different than an employee working in a store? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6333.868s">$5</a> a day would be $100 in a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6335.709s">$5</a> a day is, you're telling that person they can stay there for $5 a day, but you're telling another person if they're going to pay $100, and if they don't pay the $100, they're going to have to pay, they're going to have to move it after three hours.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=7888.37s">You</a> know, the gentleman brings up a valid point, because whether it's your building or other parts of the city where the same thing might be happening, there's going to be a real major concern as it relates to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=7897.015s">So,</a> Chief, could you answer that?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=7953.122s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=7953.862s">You</a> indicated that you would be listening to what the people are saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=7956.782s">I</a> am.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=7957.983s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=7958.283s">Under</a> advisement, because I think he makes a valid point. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=7960.703s">I</a> mean, unfortunately, you know, what if somebody is sick in the family? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=7964.744s">What</a> are they going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=7965.604s">Park?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=7966.004s">They</a> can't park in front? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=7966.964s">And</a> if there's no spots in the back, what's he going to have to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=7969.385s">Run</a> out every two hours and move his car?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=7973.71s">On</a> Saturdays, too? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=7974.69s">Saturdays?</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=7976.852s">This</a> is crazy.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9906.895s">You</a> know, tonight we've seen, uh, we started this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9908.956s">The</a> time is now it's approximately, uh, it's about 12 minutes to 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9913.498s">We</a> started at seven, probably around seven 30. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9915.159s">This</a> went on. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9917.062s">We've</a> seen a varied amount of people come before us of all ages and expressing what their concerns might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9923.083s">Jimmy's</a> Pizza, let's go with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9924.404s">Let's</a> start off with you, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9926.024s">You've</a> been there a long period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9927.404s">You've</a> worked yourself, however you worked yourself up to be a successful businessman, own the property, maintaining it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9934.346s">Now</a> you're in a position that a stupid little meter, and I'll call it that, a stupid little kiosk in front of your store is going to stop people from coming in, going into your store, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9944.445s">on</a> all the other places that you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9946.808s">And</a> the reason why it's stupid because whoever thought by putting that kiosk there as a revenue enhancement for the city didn't realize it was going to be a business loss to the city because you and all your tenants are going to wind up losing customers and you're going to wind up going maybe in a bankruptcy and the city's going to wind up having another block that might become blighted because people are fickle. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9969.189s">And</a> when they're fickle over something like this, it isn't the quarter, it's the whole idea of I'm now having to pay for something that I never had to pay for before. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9978.552s">When</a> all this was supposed to be was revenue enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9982.333s">Councilor</a> Marks was on the committee, as so was the chief of police. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9986.194s">It</a> was submitted on September of 2009. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9988.795s">They</a> worked on it from 2008 to 2009. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9993.416s">And</a> if you read what the mayor said publicly, what did he turn around? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9996.597s">We've</a> been working on this for five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9999.978s">If</a> this is what he's been working on for five years, and this is the best he could come up with, with no ribbon-cutting ceremony because it's a quiet program, well, then shame on him. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10011.321s">That</a> corner office definitely needs to be replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10014.482s">It</a> needs new leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10015.782s">It</a> needs a new vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10017.042s">It</a> needs to have an idea to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10019.743s">that</a> if I'm a businessman and I have to go to work in the morning, I have to know what it means to open the door, turn that key, and when I put that light on, I'm paying for electric, gas, workman's comp, workman's unemployment, sick, vacation, okay, and everything else that it takes to run a business. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10037.467s">That</a> guy in the corner office doesn't know what it means. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10040.028s">He</a> makes $142,000 off the taxpayers of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10043.729s">He</a> has absolutely no idea what it means to make a business work and survive. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10049.85s">And</a> that is the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10051.474s">And</a> the problem further is that he took five department heads, not one citizen, he took five department heads and came up with this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10060.021s">And</a> now it's being changed and being changed and being changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10063.742s">And</a> while it's being changed and changed, you know why it's being changed? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10066.763s">Because</a> the people are responding. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10068.544s">And</a> if they had an opportunity to have this introduced to themselves well in advance, well in advance, and each little square was addressed independently of each other, because each square is different from each other, then you'd be able to understand what the problems, what the concerns might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10084.049s">And</a> you, Mr. Chief, you probably wouldn't have to be here three weeks in a row, strike that two weeks in a row, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10088.93s">to</a> know they're going to make these changes because had the mayor done his dutiful duty, this would have all been addressed ahead of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10094.938s">Maybe</a> just a few little nuances at the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10097.321s">And</a> maybe, as Councilor Camuso alluded to, if you really wanted to get into this program and make it <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10103.062s">fair</a> and equitable for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10104.603s">You</a> should have put a parking meter in front of every single spot that people can understand what a parking meter looks like, not a kiosk, and then everybody will be treated the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10113.088s">But</a> the reason why they took them out over 50 years ago, because it was hurting business and they weren't being enforced. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10118.911s">Do</a> you realize how great this city would be? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10122.513s">It's</a> the only city. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10123.754s">You</a> go to Winchester, who now is putting these crazy things in, you go to Somerville, you go to Malden, you go to Everett. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10130.378s">If</a> we were the only city come to Medford for free parking, do you know what that would do to the business community? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10136.741s">All</a> the chief would have to do with his police officers, and I say that with all due respect, because there's money in the budget that the mayor won't give them. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10144.646s">This</a> council has been supportive of this police department each and every budget and each and every year that I've been here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10150.349s">But</a> if you had that, all you'd have to turn around, you would have time constraints in each one of the sections of the city, and you'd see the turnover take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10156.912s">And</a> you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10157.572s">And</a> the people would appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10159.614s">Why</a> all of a sudden we changing from two hours to three hours? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10162.175s">Because</a> the people complain. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10164.076s">The</a> young lady that just came up here who said she doesn't come on, she's not going to come on Thursdays anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10168.478s">She</a> might be in a dentist's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10170.258s">Quite</a> true. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10170.718s">She</a> could be in a dentist's office, could be in a doctor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10173.159s">You</a> don't know what's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10175.0s">It</a> took a hairdresser, because of her relationship to the city hall here, to scream loud enough, because she didn't want her business hurt, that it introduced itself to all the other type of hairdressers and businesses in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10187.275s">One</a> of the reasons why it's bumped up to three hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10191.678s">You</a> go up Governor's Avenue, biggest abuse in the city, go up Governor's Avenue, on the right-hand side it's two hours, on the left-hand side coming down it's one hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10199.222s">Where</a> the logic to that came from, I have absolutely no idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10202.705s">But</a> I really think we can have resolution after resolution after resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10206.647s">The</a> only way this thing is going to be resolved is that guy in the corner office is going to have to come here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10211.623s">and</a> squash it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10212.224s">I</a> think it's Mr... You live on Gill Street? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10214.565s">Is</a> that what you said you do? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10215.806s">Yeah,</a> the gentleman from Gill Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10217.408s">I</a> believe it's $900,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10218.068s">You</a> can buy yourself out of the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10220.89s">I</a> believe your boss was here two weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10223.132s">He</a> came before the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10224.393s">Within</a> the first year, if it doesn't work out, there's an opt-out provision. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10227.115s">I'd</a> rather spend a million dollars now to get rid of them because the damage that this is going to do in the long run will be worse than anything that's ever happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10239.532s">I'm</a> supporting, I'll support anything this council has to do with making this thing be better. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10245.574s">But</a> all we're doing is talking. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10247.475s">It's</a> the guy in the corner office. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10248.595s">You've</a> got to inundate that office. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10250.296s">You've</a> got to tell him we don't want it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10252.837s">Get</a> it out of here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10253.717s">You</a> know, it's kind of like interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10256.038s">Whether</a> they read a report, the Walker report, is that what you call it? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10258.919s">The</a> Walker report? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10259.859s">The</a> Walker report that this company, Republic from Tennessee, went by, I think it's 900 or 890 spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10266.852s">But</a> you had three months to locate the spots and to see if these spots were going to make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10271.735s">Why</a> are we talking about this after the fact? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10274.757s">This</a> is symptomatic of leadership that doesn't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10277.138s">There</a> is no leadership in the city right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10279.059s">It's</a> reactionary. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10280.881s">You</a> know, three hours in the parking lot, if you go outside here, that side over there on the name of the street, I don't know, there's one little kiosk in between the city's building and the parking lot over here for which half of the parking lot is private. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10294.009s">So</a> who's going to make that determination when they pull in there? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10296.67s">And</a> I think it was you, Councilman Oxford, you said it originally in the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10300.071s">Nobody</a> knows where the beginning and the end of it ends when you see a kiosk. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10303.232s">A</a> lady called me up this afternoon and she indicated, I have no idea where I'm supposed to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10307.073s">I</a> mean, am I going five spots, four spots? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10309.114s">And</a> if it's a big, long stretch, what are you supposed to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10311.815s">Who's</a> supposed to know that? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10313.115s">I</a> don't know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10313.755s">None</a> of us know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10315.656s">And</a> to get the ticket, and there's the other lady, I don't know if she's still here or if she's gone, that talked about if she's five, maybe the first hour should be free. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10322.07s">And</a> what I don't understand, and I know you're here, Mr. Nash, and you're a good guy because you're from Republican. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10327.151s">We've</a> had our conversations, but you're here to make money, and I understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10330.892s">But</a> we were told it was going to start off with two cars that are going to monitor the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10335.314s">So</a> the question is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10336.874s">Can</a> you come up here, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10342.636s">Is</a> it still going to be two cars that are going to monitor this whole city with all these issues? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10346.917s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10347.737s">So</a> you're telling me in the course of a two-hour span, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10351.963s">All</a> these concerns and all these little exceptions to the rule, you'll be able to go from A to B, you're both cars, and address every single one of the locations in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10361.087s">Is</a> that what we're saying? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10364.809s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10364.869s">Oh.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10518.814s">Councilor</a> Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10519.894s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10520.854s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10521.975s">I</a> just, you just said something. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10523.475s">Is</a> it possible that you guys could get a van and put five or 10 people in it and just drop them all around neighborhoods?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10533.218s">Well,</a> more than two people.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10543.044s">Who</a> makes that decision?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10551.305s">So</a> the only reason that you'd be doing that for a follow-up and what Councilor Camuso was saying is if your revenue is off and the revenue is going to be off because you don't have enough people on the street, you'd be going to the mayor and asking him for that permission and the mayor would be agreeing with you to meet your goal to get to that revenue number that you need to make.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10695.578s">And</a> one other thing, legally. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10697.8s">You</a> made a comment, and I don't know if you meant to say it or not, but when the question was asked about the appeal process, and I don't know what councilor asked the question, you know, if there got to be too many, you indicated, used the term, well, at that point in time, we'd probably jump in to help out. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10711.369s">I</a> don't think you can, because there is a legal contract here that's going on, and I think that's another thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10716.853s">And</a> when we get to these things that are being negotiated after the fact, and the council's not being apprised of it, I think we've got some serious problems here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10724.538s">Because</a> the fact of the matter is, we've got two contracts, one month apart from each other, 9, 10, 14, 10, 10, 14. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10731.659s">Only</a> one word, two words would change in the whole contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10734.5s">And</a> it's very explicit as to what you guys can and cannot do. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10739.481s">And</a> for them to come out with a post-press release and turn around and saying that the first year of the $300,000 we're going to get, you're going to give $250,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10747.502s">It's</a> going to go back to the business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10751.991s">That</a> was never negotiated. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10753.171s">That's</a> not part of the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10754.232s">That's</a> after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10755.532s">So</a> you've got a whole host of issues here that are just running amok because it just wasn't — this was not vetted out properly, as far as I'm concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10764.914s">I</a> know you're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10766.274s">You</a> got to do a job because this is what your job is. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10768.515s">But</a> I've got a job, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10769.915s">And</a> I've got to make sure I'm listening to the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10772.596s">And</a> I haven't found — there's only one person. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10774.456s">I'm</a> up to — I got to apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10776.777s">I'm</a> off by a few. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10777.897s">I</a> gave a different number on Sunday. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10779.278s">It's</a> 376. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10780.992s">As</a> of tonight, 376 emails. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10783.394s">Only</a> one person in the email said, I can't tell you whether it's bad or good. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10787.816s">Maybe</a> we should give it a chance. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10789.017s">But</a> probably, if you give it a chance, and the way the temperament is running, it probably won't work anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10793.42s">But</a> what the hell? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10794.881s">That's</a> the only one. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10795.681s">Everyone</a> else has been against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10797.703s">And</a> you know what the major reason is? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10800.404s">A,</a> they weren't advised. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10801.945s">B,</a> business districts did not meet between and amongst themselves to discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10806.929s">And</a> C, it seems kind of odd. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10809.501s">that</a> the city council is discussing this after the fact, not before the fact.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11005.02s">Do</a> you don't want the citizen to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11014.982s">What</a> incentive is there for a Metric police officer to write a ticket knowing that the money isn't even going to come back to the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11021.107s">Because</a> it has to go to Republic first. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11023.308s">They've</a> got to get to a certain dollar amount before the city even gets any money.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11042.993s">So</a> if Republic only is going to have two cars on the road during the course of a day, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11050.015s">You're</a> only going to have these two. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11051.456s">I'm</a> quite sure they have to take coffee breaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11052.936s">They're</a> going to have to take their lunch break. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11055.257s">So</a> at some point in time, there may be only one car on the road.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11929.848s">There</a> you are, you're taking it away from the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11931.95s">Have</a> the mayor come to a council meeting where he belongs. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11934.852s">Not</a> in a committee of the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11937.394s">Councilor</a> Penta, if I can.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11943.919s">Well,</a> if he's not going to come, he's telling the people, he's slapping them. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11947.041s">He</a> doesn't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11947.642s">He</a> doesn't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11949.103s">And</a> they'll do what they have to do in November. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11950.704s">They'll</a> either vote him out or vote him in. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11952.345s">One</a> or the other.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11968.14s">And</a> then, and then we will discuss it again at seven o'clock and then we'll discuss it again at seven o'clock at the council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11974.382s">We'll</a> discuss whatever took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11975.943s">And</a> the poor people that have to come down here are going to want to know why.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11981.367s">But</a> everybody has to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11982.448s">People</a> have to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11983.089s">They</a> have families they have to deal with. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11984.67s">They</a> know 7 o'clock Tuesday night is a council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11987.092s">It's</a> an open public forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11988.513s">Anybody</a> can come here, including the mayor.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11993.877s">That's</a> not our fault that the mayor chooses not to come here, councillor. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11996.919s">I</a> don't know what he's afraid of. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11998.1s">Well,</a> then let's move the question here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11999.861s">Move</a> it that he appear before the Medford City Council, not the Committee of the Whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12005.545s">Invite</a> him to the Medford City Council next Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12007.306s">Do</a> we not want a Committee of the Whole meeting?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12018.13s">Roll</a> call vote.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12022.291s">Well,</a> I'd like to have them appear before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12026.833s">What</a> are we going to do over here? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12028.053s">Be</a> third party to repeat back?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12205.333s">Who's</a> going to place on the agenda for next week that this discussion continue?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12285.653s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12285.753s">Move</a> the question.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12357.967s">Yeah,</a> I'm really, I'm confused with this resolution here now because as Councilor Light alluded to last year, he said in December, he was working with the city clerk going back to last June, going over some of these positions and then, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12370.992s">The</a> biggest position that we have on the council agenda on our council forum is president and vice president, because they're the ones that have to set the tempo for who gets these positions and how we're going to get to there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12381.318s">And</a> neither one of those were vetted out. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12383.199s">But</a> now, all of a sudden, we're going to vet out other positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12385.52s">And</a> I just don't understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12387.001s">I'm</a> not going to support this, because there's absolutely no — there's no rhyme or reason to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12390.923s">Because</a> if that be the case, Mr. President, you've got no authority to make any appointments right now to any committees, because every one of those positions need to be vetted out. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12398.867s">And</a> every other position that <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12400.169s">comes</a> under the state statute for which a council member is eligible for, it doesn't seem to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12406.913s">There's</a> something behind this, and I don't know what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12409.094s">I</a> just think it's unfair to the entire council that we would be talking about something like this now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12415.017s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12471.735s">The</a> difference, Mr. President, between the mayor presenting them to us is because the council requested it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12479.218s">You</a> know, we're a small group of people here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12481.919s">And</a> if you've been working on this since June of last year, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12485.54s">And</a> this is all that you can come up with, and so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12487.841s">The</a> other part of the thing is, then maybe we should have vetted out your opposition. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12491.041s">You</a> were only here three weeks, and you voted yourself a pay raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12493.342s">And</a> you voted for it, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12494.662s">I</a> did not vote for the pay raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12495.922s">You</a> voted for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12496.662s">Check</a> the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12497.122s">No,</a> you voted for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12498.703s">I</a> don't care what the record says. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12499.803s">I</a> know what I voted for and what I didn't vote for. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12501.443s">You</a> voted for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12502.483s">But</a> that's not it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12503.324s">And</a> that's the whole thing with the problem here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12506.724s">Mr.</a> President, whoever serves up there as the president of the council has the right to make the introductions. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12510.47s">to</a> whatever the positions might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12512.351s">Just</a> as Councilor Caraviello, he made a request of the mayor to be on a particular board. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12516.735s">He</a> went there, and he did what he had to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12518.276s">These</a> are all political positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12520.458s">When,</a> all of a sudden, now we have to put a resume in to become a chairman of a committee or something, or what we've done, or what we haven't done, I thought the answer to that was the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12529.825s">The</a> people would vote us out.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12531.606s">The</a> people would vote us in or vote us out for what we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12533.007s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12660.669s">Councilor</a> Pantano. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12661.771s">The</a> best possible people to serve in these positions should be vetted out starting with the president and the vice president and we should just go through that and that's probably what the council should have done <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12670.608s">this</a> past year to find out who the best person, not the number one vote getter, not the one who's been here the longest or the shortest, who's accomplished and done the most on the city council, who would make a good representative. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12681.591s">Not</a> because of the political path.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12701.819s">What</a> are you talking about? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12702.599s">What</a> votes? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12702.899s">Votes</a> to get the votes.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12707.241s">Oh,</a> I didn't ask to become president or vice president.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12711.263s">I</a> didn't ask for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12711.663s">Well,</a> no, no, you didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12712.383s">You</a> didn't have the votes.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13447.1s">This</a> was a notice sent out from the Department of Public Utilities <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13451.028s">for</a> a hearing that's going to be forthcoming in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13453.71s">And</a> then there's a whole other bunch of locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13455.371s">They're</a> going to be in Worcester, and Dedham, and Keith Middle School, and New Bedford, Plymouth, and then one in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13462.935s">The</a> rate increase of 37% I think we've all felt it in our electric bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13467.978s">And</a> the gas company basically gets their money or their proposals that are associated with the sale of the company's appliance business and their operation of home heating protection plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13480.895s">It</a> goes like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13482.557s">During</a> the winter months, if you use 160 therms of gas per month, your bill will increase by $25.90, which will be a 13.1% increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13489.282s">And</a> then during the summer months, if you use more than 31 therms a month, your bill will increase by $8.38, which is a 19.6% increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13509.098s">The</a> 8% was wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13512.219s">It's</a> wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13513.159s">It's</a> more than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13514.46s">So</a> I guess between, unfortunately, I took the increase from the summer months rather than the winter, put it together. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13522.042s">The</a> fact of the matter is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13523.423s">The</a> rate increase is going to go up. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13524.963s">In</a> your winter bill, it's going to go up by a minimum of $25.90 a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13529.205s">And</a> in the summer, it's going to go up by a minimum of $8.38 a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13532.986s">And</a> on top of the 37% that you're being charged for the electric bill, it's just crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13537.716s">As</a> I said before, when we were talking about these electric rates, the top administrators from the president town received in excess of $1 million bonuses while they were enacting these rate increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13548.139s">We</a> have no choice over this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13550.26s">It's</a> a monopoly that NSTAR seems to have over our gas and electric bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13554.321s">And</a> the only one way to stop this is if cities and towns just respond back to Mr. Marini, the secretary, so he would have that in front of him before the State Department of Public Utilities makes their <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13566.123s">final</a> decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13567.443s">And</a> I would hope that our state legislature would likewise be on board with this because, you know, people are just getting taxed and taxed and taxed and more taxed to death. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13577.546s">And</a> here's a situation where there are two companies, gas and electric, where the people who run it are just making hundreds of thousands of dollars in their salaries over and beyond that for which people are struggling just to stay alive.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13604.721s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13605.301s">He</a> rolled out. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13606.002s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13606.602s">I'll</a> tell you one thing about this governor. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13607.943s">The</a> first day in office, what he did is he took $100 million that the then-governor, Patrick, wouldn't do, and he put it back into road and bridges in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13616.99s">And</a> that's a big plus. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13618.231s">And</a> he's keeping his commitment to local aid, which is something that Patrick wouldn't do. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13622.094s">So</a> those are two big pluses right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13624.13s">for</a> cities and towns.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13783.835s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13784.495s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13784.796s">Federal.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13789.718s">You</a> tired. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13790.138s">Go</a> ahead.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13916.358s">No,</a> no, no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13916.878s">I</a> want the original motion.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13919.379s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13921.059s">Yeah,</a> I do want it to go there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13921.98s">That's</a> the amendment.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13923.977s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13924.277s">That's</a> the main motion.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=14097.863s">Yeah,</a> we got a document here tonight from Mass Development as it relates to Tufts University making a request for $100 million in tax-exempt bonds to do a project. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=14111.089s">It</a> says here that they financed Interior to Robinson Hall on the Medford-Sumnerville campus and the Biomedical Research and Public Health Building on the Boston campus, including relocation of the Information Technology Department and the Sterns Wing <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=14125.141s">and</a> the acquisition of an apartment building located at 119 College Avenue, Somerville, near the Somerville campus, as well as the other routine Capitol level. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=14134.606s">I</a> think what's concerning to me is, if I remember correctly, they appeared before the council some time ago looking for, I believe, an easement to cross over a street down on the Somerville line. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=14147.252s">There</a> was no mention at the time of their expansion to include buying an apartment building <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=14154.453s">at</a> 119 College Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=14156.354s">So</a> could we get an update on 119 from Tufts? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=14159.756s">What</a> is 119 College Ave? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=14161.397s">How</a> many students do they intend to put in there? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=14167.6s">119</a> College Ave.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=14173.323s">It's</a> a combination.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=14176.544s">Yeah,</a> it's on the Medford-Sumner line. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=14178.265s">So</a> I just don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=14180.426s">We</a> could send that to Bob Arubel's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=14183.268s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=14185.856s">No,</a> all it says that the acquisition of an apartment building located at 119 in the Somerville-Metford slash Somerville-Metford-Boston and Grafton campuses, the bonds financing the property acquisition will be used on a taxable basis.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_KvW9uYtSUXQ/2025-03-21_KvW9uYtSUXQ.html">Medford City Council - January 6, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1635.35s">On</a> that motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1636.311s">On</a> that subject matter, I believe it's incumbent upon somebody in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1640.915s">And</a> it's obvious that the administration maybe doesn't want to handle it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1645.839s">It</a> doesn't want to talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1646.76s">But</a> the fact of the matter is, <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1648.811s">We</a> have two particular cases that I wrote standing. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1650.833s">One</a> is the West Method Little League Hillside, and the other one is Channel 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1654.975s">And</a> Channel 3 has a large duty of obligation to the rate payers who have Comcast television, and now for those folks that have Verizon television. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1665.682s">Because</a> on a monthly basis, a fee has been taken out of your Comcast and Verizon bills for the purposes of giving you public access TV. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1673.927s">Why</a> the mayor decided to choose to put it up at the high school, a place that's not convenient, <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1678.482s">and</a> centrally located as was suggested by the that the mayor commissioned back in January, which submitted their report this past March. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1687.044s">I</a> mean, April, excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1688.044s">Um,</a> I don't know why, but the fact of the matter is it's going up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1691.385s">But</a> during that period of time, there's a lot of new folks that are here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1694.005s">So</a> you might as well hear it for the first time during that period of time, since December of 2000, um, 2013 till now, uh, the city of Medford has amassed over 356 million, $356,000 of your rate payers money. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1707.864s">And</a> we haven't had public access TV during that period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1711.466s">Now,</a> there's an approximate cost of, I believe, in the booklet that we received two weeks ago, of a cost of approximately $300,000, I think, and $26,000 to refurbish a particular part of the vocational school to have public access be up there and running. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1727.494s">I</a> may be off by a few dollars, but I think that's the dollar amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1730.615s">With</a> that being said, you know, it's a step. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1732.879s">Is</a> it a step in the right direction? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1734.1s">Hopefully</a> it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1735.262s">But</a> the fact of the matter is that the old board of directors and the members of Channel 3 have been unaccounting <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1741.226s">are</a> unaccountable for all the monies that they had not only in their inventory of assets, but also in their inventory of cash and deposits minutes to the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1752.57s">And</a> as Mr. Viglione indicated, um, our city solicitor has made numerous requests of those folks to submit the returns, um, to give our cash balances. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1762.173s">What's</a> the name of the bank accounts? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1764.013s">And</a> we have yet to receive that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1766.394s">I</a> know that they filed a petition of dissolution back, I believe, in October of 2014, in 2013, excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1778.556s">And</a> to this day, we still have nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1782.176s">What</a> it's going to take, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1784.257s">I</a> would hope that the mayor would have been more aggressive in going after your money, because it is your money, as a rate payer. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1791.302s">to</a> a cable TV subscriber, Comcast, and now Verizon, that's an awful lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1796.225s">But</a> we haven't had it for a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1797.906s">So,</a> I think if I understood the gentleman at the podium correctly, these are things that are part of our municipal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1804.61s">And</a> when you attach the name of Medford on anything that a governmental entity or a non-governmental entity might do, but to take advantage of the city's name of Medford, I think there is a sense of responsibility that we do have. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1816.617s">And</a> I would hope, Mr. President, under your leadership, <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1819.446s">there</a> would be some sense of a committee meeting that would direct ourselves by way of maybe either policy or directing of the mayor to report back as it relates to these entities that use the name of Medford to their advantage, but to the disadvantage of the people who are using, are playing, or a cable subscriber that unfortunately has the name of Medford attached to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1840.642s">So</a> I think before you receive it and place it on file, there is a common understanding I think that needs to be made <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1847.259s">to</a> cable TV subscribers, because I think if they knew each and every month, Mr. President, that money was coming out of their cable bill since December of 2013 until now, and if they realize that the city is sitting on $356,000 of their money, and there was no public access station for all that period of time, I don't think that they would appreciate it, and I don't think a lot of people understand it, because it's just <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1868.228s">That's</a> a small little notation on your cable bill, but it's there each and every month, whether it's 97 cents or a dollar something, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=1874.79s">But</a> I just wanted to say that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2377.366s">There</a> may be a new committee you may want to find. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2379.747s">You</a> may want to eliminate some committees.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2790.954s">Yeah,</a> one quick point before the citizens speak, and I think it has to be made clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2795.738s">The</a> Medford City Council did not vote for this paid park program. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2800.845s">The</a> council agenda of 14472 on May 20th of 2014 read as follows for the purposes of supporting the mayor to entertain or to engage in a 10-year contract and then report back. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2814.253s">But</a> that resolution was amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2818.175s">And</a> this is the exact words. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2819.536s">And</a> if anybody doubts what I'm saying, you can get a copy of the tape and watch it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2823.978s">The</a> exact words are as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2825.639s">And</a> it's not the exact words that are in the minutes of the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2828.281s">It</a> says the following, to amend the motion <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2830.424s">that</a> the council meet before the signing so that we have a complete understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2835.228s">And</a> at that point, I was interrupted by city solicitor Rumbley, who then indicated by saying that he thought it would be a good idea to have the company and also show the council certain things about the machine and of end of quote, then I continued on to say, so as amended that having the major, the mayor, whoever the vendor might be to present themselves before the council before the finalization of the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2859.127s">Now,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2860.572s">That</a> is officially on our records of our meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2866.138s">September</a> 10th of this past year, the Medford City Council met for the purposes of looking at a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2874.467s">right</a> here, we've got two of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2876.528s">One</a> we got in September and another one in October. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2879.37s">The</a> exact same contract a month apart with just one difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2883.732s">The</a> Medford City Council at that meeting on September 10th was met at that room by Medford citizens, certain members of the council, and questions as it relates to the contract that was being presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2894.558s">The</a> Medford City Council never ever took a vote to finalize or giving the mayor the final authority for the purposes of engaging <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2902.622s">in</a> this pay-to-park program. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2904.442s">So</a> what you have here right now and what you talk about right now is completely the Mayor McGlynn's pay-to-park program with no endorsement from the City of Medford's Council or any other elected official. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2915.545s">It's</a> his program and he owns it and unfortunately you're here tonight but whatever we can do to resolve it, this is the intent of the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2923.307s">Unfortunately</a> I wish the Mayor was here to listen to you <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2925.948s">Like</a> Councilman Mark said, it should have gone around to the entire community. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2929.471s">There's</a> a whole bunch of issues, and pitches don't lie. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2932.093s">I've</a> got a whole bunch of pitches, and I have comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2933.915s">I've</a> received 106 emails from business people throughout this community in the last two days, because they're starting to find out about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2941.521s">But</a> I'm willing to stay here all night, listen to whatever your comments are, and Chief, with all due respect, I think this is a bogus plan implemented upon the citizens, the business community, and the taxpayers of the city of Medford.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4509.378s">Just</a> as a point of clarification, Chief, you said for years and years we've had a lot of what, free parking? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4514.14s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4514.26s">On</a> the streets.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4515.241s">But</a> we've also had an extreme lack of enforcement, and we wouldn't be here if the enforcement activity took place.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4706.619s">Chief</a> pointed further clarification in the report that you folks submitted. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4710.921s">on</a> page number two. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4712.428s">Third</a> paragraph, first line, if parking is a major problem in the city, then a necessary first step in taking that enforcement needs to be seriously taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4720.69s">Last</a> sentence, what was realized was the steady, consistent enforcement was necessary where all violations and violators were treated the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4728.912s">That's</a> 2009, this is 2014, that's five years later, this mayor's been here and for five years he's done nothing about traffic enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4737.634s">Now</a> he wants to beat the people up and make this a revenue enhancement program and that's
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5565.999s">All</a> the council voted for was to authorize the mayor to go forward and look into a 10-year contract because we had three people come. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5575.665s">All</a> three of them had a 10-year proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5577.546s">It</a> was over a three-year minimum for which the procurement officer said these are what the people had to come in with. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5583.607s">and</a> the council voted with an amendment that the council meet before the signing so that we have a complete understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5591.369s">And</a> I further amended it by saying that having the mayor, whoever the vendor might be, present themselves before the council before the finalization of the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5600.551s">So</a> before the finalization of the contract to me means before that contract is signed. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5605.812s">And</a> if we don't agree or something has to be changed, we never have the opportunity to take the vote or discuss anything about a finalization. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5613.754s">And,</a> I tell you, it's on the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5617.816s">It's</a> clearly on the record, as clear as the bell. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5620.697s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Padgett.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5658.278s">On</a> that particular issue, excuse me, I have pictures of every tree that was bolted by a sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5664.459s">If</a> the mayor was on top of his game, they would have known right from the beginning never to put a sign on a tree to start off with.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5672.521s">There</a> was no communication, not even with the mayor to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5676.062s">I'm</a> not yelling at you because you know something, this is such a disruptive piece of legislation that we shouldn't even be discussing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=5683.224s">The</a> mayor should be in here apologizing and saying,
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6102.748s">You're</a> telling me in that loading zone up on the hillside, somebody goes in there, they're going to have, and they want to get some paint and they have to stir the paint and shake it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6110.111s">They</a> have to be out in five minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6111.171s">They're</a> going to get a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6113.052s">Five</a> minutes.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6115.272s">Well,</a> that's the whole thing about being reasonable here.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6139.214s">It's</a> a loading zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6140.054s">He</a> just said for commercial and residential purposes.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6210.772s">You</a> have three different time limits in that parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6212.793s">How</a> come there's no kiosks in there? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6214.83s">You</a> have a kind of limit against the wall on the back of Salvatore's. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6217.852s">Then</a> you have one for the business people on that wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6220.254s">And</a> in the middle, you have two hour parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6221.895s">You</a> have one hour, you have two hour, and the back of the wall parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6224.677s">There's</a> three different parking types in that parking lot.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6230.662s">Why</a> isn't there just something that's consistent? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6233.389s">The</a> clarification, what is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6234.81s">How</a> can you have one hour, somebody, because they parked their car parallel, somebody parking it horizontal? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6241.194s">What</a> difference?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6261.494s">There's</a> a corollary point to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6263.154s">You</a> go up Governor's Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6264.455s">How</a> come if you go up Governor's Avenue, you've done nothing with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6267.136s">It's</a> two hours on the right going up, and one hour coming back on the left.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8598.277s">Are</a> you saying that you already provided that to the city, but, and you're just rolling it out now? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8604.583s">Is</a> that in the contract?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8611.035s">I</a> have all your responses, but that was never explained to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8613.337s">And</a> another thing on the like venue, if I go online and I want to get a permit parking, a $10 permit parking, they're charging me $3 to go online to get a $10. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8622.542s">That's</a> extortion. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8623.983s">30%</a> on a $10? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8625.183s">On</a> a $10? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8627.845s">When</a> people before could come down to City Hall and get it for nothing?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8634.949s">We're</a> talking about going online. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8637.672s">to</a> make it easier for the customer. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8639.153s">Councilor</a> Knight just alluded to the fact you have to pay 35 cents to put a 25 cent time period in. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8644.098s">So</a> you are charging 30% to buy a $10 to buy. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8647.361s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Camuso.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8659.972s">It's</a> not a 30% charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8661.64s">Councilor,</a> it's a nominal fee, but 30 cents. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8666.843s">It's</a> not, you know, listen, you guys are here only for one reason to make money. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8671.705s">That's</a> the bottom line. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8672.686s">And</a> we understand that, but I'm here to make sure that you don't make money and give the city back to the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8677.969s">So</a> let them figure out what they need to do.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8703.029s">So</a> if you pop was and leave that spot and go to another spot, can they go to another spot of that? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8713.496s">Is</a> that it for the day? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8714.256s">You</a> only can do two hours.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9035.202s">Chief,</a> I believe there's approximately eight parking spaces in the front of the senior center. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9040.445s">And</a> a lot of the times they will park across the street in the parking lot over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9045.122s">Now,</a> I have two pictures here that were taken at nighttime. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9049.431s">You</a> have two kiosks against the business wall of that parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9054.034s">And</a> here's a picture of the parking lot for which somebody would have to walk from the sidewalk, where those businesses are, all the way to the ring road. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9061.459s">There's</a> not one kiosk. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9063.52s">How</a> is anyone supposed to figure that out? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9065.321s">And</a> especially at nighttime, when it's dark out, you can't even see these kiosks.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9071.646s">What</a> are you talking about? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9072.266s">At</a> 4 o'clock at nighttime, it's dark out. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9074.427s">And</a> you can't see. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9075.028s">How</a> are you going to see these? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9076.229s">Against</a> the wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9077.169s">And</a> if somebody's coming in, <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9078.67s">And</a> if they're a guest at the senior center and not knowing that they have to go to a kiosk, what are they going to walk, 150 feet to go put money in a kiosk?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9096.595s">But</a> that's even further away than the parking lot is here.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9103.917s">When</a> seniors, when they have their Christmas thing and whatever it might be, they may get 100, 150 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9108.6s">And</a> sometimes it might go to two or three hours, whatever the event might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9112.102s">Why</a> should they be worrying about having to come out and put money in a meter?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9118.386s">But</a> why wasn't this thought out ahead of time? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9119.987s">This</a> is the whole issue of not having meetings ahead of time to discuss these matters.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9161.277s">But</a> having always another issue is good to create the idea that had you had these meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9166.368s">These</a> issues would be minimal now. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9168.29s">These</a> are major. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9169.371s">And</a> what's happening is the small businessman, who's the lifeline of this community, is at risk because they're worried about their customers, whether they come back or not, whether they have appropriate parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9179.06s">And</a> now, as Councilor Monk just alluded to, and I heard it earlier tonight, a special validation program. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9184.145s">So</a> what are we going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9185.126s">Take</a> care of special people that contributed to the mayor's office and make sure that their tickets are taken care of?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9236.557s">I'd</a> just like to finish, so I can finish my train of thought.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9311.197s">Chief,</a> in all fairness, to this council especially, Hank Philippi Ryan came to this community and did an expose on its Channel 7. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9318.743s">And</a> they talked to the mayor, and the mayor was asked a question about the non-enforcement up in the metro area. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9325.753s">for</a> people parking there, and they did it for a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9327.776s">It</a> wasn't a day, a month, the same people, no enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9330.38s">And</a> the mayor had the audacity to blame the city council for not giving the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9333.645s">That</a> was absolutely not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9335.347s">This</a> Medford City Council has been most supportive of the police department and the fire department on every one of those issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9341.035s">So</a> taking that and coming forward, you have a tax bill, you have a water bill, you have an excise, you have a meals tax, and you're having business people that are trying to survive. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9348.499s">You</a> have a man that's never owned a business, doesn't know what it means to wake up in the morning, open the door, turn the key, gas, electric, employment, workman's comp, insurance, renter's insurance, trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9360.645s">You</a> put, you, you, you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9364.787s">You</a> put all that together, then you'll have an understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9369.331s">You'll</a> have an understanding what the small little business man has to go through. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9372.874s">Believe</a> me.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9390.528s">Do</a> you remember a few years ago? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9392.45s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9394.347s">You</a> know, on Riverside Avenue, when they shut down Riverside Avenue for the Ring Road, you put 39 businesses out because you took their front door visibility away, people that were here for years and years and years, and now what you're going to do is tell the small businessmen we're going to go to having a revenue enhancement rather than a traffic enforcement program. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9414.157s">Start</a> it small, see where it takes you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9681.586s">Point</a> of order on that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9685.288s">On</a> that question today in South Medford, I got a phone call from a business person. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9688.33s">The</a> people from Republic were there telling people that they had to put the money in the meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9692.5s">So,</a> I mean, what is it, the 5th, the 15th? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9695.482s">Why</a> is Republic here? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9697.303s">Why</a> are your people telling people to put the money in the meter?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9707.329s">So</a> you're taking money in the meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9708.35s">That's</a> what you're doing.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9718.176s">What'd</a> you say? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9719.136s">Enforcement.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9722.97s">That's</a> not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9723.711s">What</a> are you talking about? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9724.631s">You're</a> taking people's money now. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9726.313s">So</a> you're having 10 days of free money before you even do any enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=9730.256s">To</a> learn how to use the system.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10436.652s">Yeah,</a> Jack, I think, excuse me, Mr. Skelton, I think you indicated when you folks were here that you folks needed to do approximately $2 million a year in business? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10445.575s">That</a> was the projections that were working off of, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10448.577s">You</a> needed $2 million a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10450.417s">And</a> the city gets, after the first year, the city gets $300,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10454.319s">And</a> then after the second year, the city gets $700,000, going up to the seventh year. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10459.041s">And</a> then years eight, nine, and 10, it's a renegotiable too. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10462.122s">So</a> if the city goes from $300,000 to $700,000, that's a $400,000 jump in one year, how much do you folks expect to make between the first and the second year?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10485.798s">So</a> if we're guaranteed a minimum of 300,000 the first year, because you have to do the cost for the kiosks and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10492.862s">And</a> the second year it jumps up 400,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10494.643s">So</a> that's like 110% increase to the city, if not more.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10502.848s">So</a> if the thresholds are not met, <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10505.72s">Isn't</a> that an allowance for the city to opt out of the contract likewise with you? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10509.702s">The</a> city has the option to terminate the contract at any time.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10520.989s">And</a> how much is the investment right now, so far, approximately? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10524.812s">About</a> $800,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10525.532s">About</a> $800,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10525.772s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10525.892s">Well,</a> $800,000, that's for the cost of what, the kiosks and the signs? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10527.653s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10535.815s">all</a> of the technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10536.801s">Okay,</a> all the technology and the science. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10540.859s">this</a> supposedly 10 year deal.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10545.522s">It's</a> relative to the money part of what he was talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10548.164s">It's</a> a corollary, you know what those are? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10549.665s">The</a> corollaries go like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10551.327s">The</a> commentary was- It sounds like a run on sentence, councillor. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10554.209s">It's</a> an $18 million contract, but it's not $18 million for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10557.851s">This</a> is an $18 million contract between you and the city and the city of Medford comes out of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10562.134s">If</a> we follow just your projections, if everything is met to $7.9 million, not $18 million as reported. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10571.476s">If</a> I understand that correctly, a guarantee of $300 the first year, $700 the next year, if everything is met for the next seven years, figure that out for the 10-year of the contract, it's $7.9 million, not $18 million.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10588.844s">But</a> the revenue projection doesn't come to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10592.286s">If</a> we're getting $7.9, you're getting at least that, if not more.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10601.601s">Well,</a> I think maybe the city should really deeply investigate the fact that if we are locked into this for at least one year, we have an option to maybe look at this and maybe get out of it because I, you know, to be honest with you, that's an awful lot of money for you guys to think you're going to generate $2 million a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10617.678s">And</a> the $2 million a year just might not happen if people figure out, listen, I'm not going to go there and spend this money in the computer. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10623.304s">I</a> mean, in the kiosk, <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10624.686s">As</a> Councilor Knight has alluded to, why am I supposed to spend 35 cents to put a quarter into the meter? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10628.51s">That's</a> another screwy thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10629.931s">And</a> if you have a validation program, that's only going to hit certain people to the exclusion of other, which is discriminatory as far as I'm concerned, every single business needs to be treated the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10638.98s">And</a> if they're not going to be treated the same, then the program can never work with equity. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=10645.206s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Penta.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11683.999s">Councilor</a> Penta? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11684.76s">Chief,</a> at the outset, I probably should have said this right in the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11688.522s">You</a> don't belong here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11689.323s">The</a> mayor belongs here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11690.123s">This</a> is not your program. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11691.284s">This</a> is the mayor's program. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11692.565s">And</a> I'm involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11693.845s">And</a> you're doing his nasty work right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11696.367s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11697.448s">About</a> three weeks ago, Dan, you and I, and I think a fellow by the name of John N. Candola, met at the coffee shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11704.652s">I</a> want to get back to your comment, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11707.423s">We</a> had a lot of conversation about a lot of the concerns that are out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11710.106s">And</a> I think you agreed and you said basically a lot of the things you and I were talking about, you agreed. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11714.53s">One</a> big issue, the appeal process. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11717.352s">And</a> what did you say? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11718.173s">Correct</a> me if I'm wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11718.954s">I'll</a> paraphrase you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11720.175s">You</a> said, if there was one thing you oppressed upon the mayor, keep it out of city hall, get an outside independent person. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11726.0s">That's</a> what you said.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11754.704s">No,</a> you indicated at that point in time, it would be wise and advisable to hire an outside independent person <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11760.191s">That</a> way there would be no conflict as it relates to the parking ticket and city hall.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11780.738s">So</a> your recommendation is almost the same, whether it be Springfield and Medford or what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11785.439s">Why</a> should Medford be any different than Springfield? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11788.862s">I</a> think every city's different.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11815.879s">Well,</a> I think that's something that should have been discussed <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11818.292s">and</a> finalized and included in the contract, but just for the type of terminology that you're saying, that if in fact it gets to a point in time, as Councilor Marksley alluded to, and then an outside independent person needs to come in if they want to start off small, but the mayor was adamant. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11831.439s">So</a> if the mayor is going to be that adamant that Diane McLeod is a lovely person, she does her job, she has a full-time job to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11837.963s">So</a> I don't know how she's going to be able to pick up and chief, even though you said she may get all the technological thing, it might go up to a hundred. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11843.746s">I</a> mean, a hundred appeals is a hundred appeals. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11845.707s">That's</a> a lot to take care of during a period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11848.407s">But</a> all I know is this, that if I was a contributor to the mayor of this community, and I wound up getting a ticket, I'd be knocking on his door and saying, hey, what's this all about? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11855.832s">Oh,</a> you're not going to get another contribution from me. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11858.133s">Because</a> he kept it here in City Hall, which is wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11860.815s">It</a> should be out of City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11862.096s">If</a> this program really wanted to work its way right, it would be completely independent to anything that's political. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11867.419s">And</a> if you have to work out these little things, Councilor Camuso, I probably agree with you in one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11872.142s">And</a> that's this. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11873.183s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11873.628s">on</a> this particular thing, and I think it's a big one. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11875.389s">I</a> think if you were going to put meters in the city, you should have put meters so everybody that drove up would have seen them, they would have been able to understand it, the signage would have said how long you could have stayed, and this would have relieved an awful lot, an awful lot of the grief that's here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11888.185s">But</a> your inconsistencies are all over the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11890.506s">I'm</a> not saying you, because you guys are only doing as you said where the mayor told you to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11895.187s">I</a> don't understand how you can go down Main Street from Medford Square to South Medford and have blocks of stores, have nothing at all, and then go to West Medford where there are kiosks, go to Haines Square where there are kiosks, and then Haines Square, at the end of Haines Square come to Medford Square, <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11911.363s">as</a> Mr. Dobbs indicated, have had the same blocks of stores, like businesses, not having anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11917.047s">And</a> if you're going to say you're going to roll it out further, there's another phase to this, that means there's going to be more anguish and more heartache to the people in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11926.133s">We're</a> not Newbury Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11927.354s">We</a> don't have to get up at 7 o'clock in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11929.476s">And</a> Newbury Street in Boston is the only place where they did this experiment with the kiosk, because the other parts of Boston still have the, and Brookline, who had the kiosk, got rid of it, because it was damning to the business community out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11940.183s">We're</a> not one of these communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11941.785s">We're</a> a simple little community. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11943.786s">Point</a> of information.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11959.521s">It's</a> not station.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12087.631s">Councilor</a> Penta has the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12091.133s">I</a> disagree extremely with Councilor Knight on this because the past is the leader of the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12095.916s">And</a> if you can't learn from the past, the future will never have any value. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12099.429s">The</a> fact of the matter is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12101.091s">There</a> was no process. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12102.133s">It</a> never took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12103.194s">And</a> every time you keep saying, well, we have no recourse. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12105.417s">Let's</a> go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12106.118s">How</a> can you go forward when you don't even know what took place? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12108.382s">Because</a> you weren't a part of it, when you were asked to be a part of it, when you were told to be a part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12112.568s">And</a> you never voted for the finalization of the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12114.991s">The</a> man took it upon himself. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12118.343s">The</a> bottom line to this whole thing is that there's a whole bunch of issues here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12122.065s">You</a> guys are only here for one reason, that's to make money. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12124.246s">You're</a> not here to help the city of Medford, you're here to get your salary and to make money. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12127.948s">So</a> as far as that concern, you should probably sit down because the real questions that need to be asked, the mayor, he's the one that should be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12133.711s">He's</a> the one that should be explaining all of this to the people that's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12138.093s">So</a> let me ask you something, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12140.694s">Well,</a> I'm gonna ask him something, he wants to stay there. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12144.438s">I</a> like him, he's a nice guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12146.359s">Let</a> me ask you something. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12147.379s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12147.939s">I</a> have pictures here of you people bolting signs to trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12150.52s">Why</a> did you bolt the signs to the trees? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12152.961s">Were</a> you told to do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12154.742s">No,</a> we were not.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12171.833s">Well,</a> what about the signs in Haines Square?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12178.059s">Well,</a> didn't the mayor give you any instructions not to bolt signs on trees? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12180.821s">Did</a> anybody tell you that? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12181.882s">It's</a> against the ordinance to do that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12185.205s">No,</a> did anybody tell you if you're going to put the signs up?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12204.392s">Yeah,</a> because it's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12205.553s">It's</a> part of what this process is all about.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12210.637s">Yes,</a> I did.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12215.08s">Well,</a> that's in your mind.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12217.142s">That's</a> why your mind and mine is entirely different. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12218.984s">That's</a> correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12219.584s">Thank</a> God. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12220.385s">I</a> have a pitch, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12221.826s">I</a> have a pitch.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12300.676s">In</a> response to Councilor Knight, that's absolutely not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12303.018s">If</a> you read the contract in the IRFP, they made the commitment to put the signs up and to replace the signs that are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12308.842s">That's</a> part of the contract.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12356.473s">Councilor</a> Penta has- Yeah, the contract and the IRFP and the three pages of questions that were asked for which you, Republic, indicated that you folks would put up the signs and you would replace- is that true or false? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12368.895s">That</a> you would replace and put up the signs that were existing. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12372.556s">That's</a> part of the contract.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12376.381s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12377.242s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12377.862s">Not</a> the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12379.103s">Um,</a> we have a, I have a picture here of one of your kiosks in front of Oak Grove cemetery on the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12385.467s">Can</a> you please explain in the middle of a snowstorm when they go down the street to plow the sidewalk?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12412.864s">You</a> do this? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12413.744s">You</a> plow the sidewalk, Councilor?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12418.268s">You</a> do the plowing on the sidewalk, yes or no? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12421.333s">In</a> front of Oak Grove Cemetery, do you plow the sidewalk there? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12423.655s">Yes</a> or no? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12424.376s">You're</a> an expert. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12425.357s">Yes</a> or no?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12427.339s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12428.0s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12428.861s">Sure,</a> it'd help if they asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12431.523s">You</a> have one in the middle of the sidewalk there. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12433.225s">Is</a> there any particular reason why I had to go there and not other places? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12439.311s">And</a> this spot also has $5 a day parking, so.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12452.957s">Five</a> dollars a day is a bargain, it's a steal to come to the city of Medford, take the bus, go to Boston, and to park there, five dollars a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12460.384s">But</a> if you have to go down to West Medford, South Medford, North Medford, or Medford Square, you gotta pay to put the money in the quarter, and the most you can do is stay there for two hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12468.651s">So</a> how is that a bargain for the people of Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12471.374s">It's</a> not a bargain. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12473.696s">No,</a> I don't, I don't want an out-of-towner coming here for five days when a homegrown person's gonna pay more.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12493.458s">Thank</a> you for your point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12494.598s">Well,</a> if we're agreeing, what are you yelling at me for? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12496.259s">Because</a> I love you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12501.981s">Yeah,</a> also, Dan, I have pictures here and up in West Medford, and I have pictures up here <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12510.018s">On</a> the hillside in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12512.059s">You</a> have kiosks in front of residential homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12514.061s">Why?</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12524.908s">No,</a> this is across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12527.93s">This</a> is on, these ones here are on Boston Avenue, opposite where Dunkin' Donuts and Nick's Pizza and all that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12535.215s">It's</a> all residential on that side of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12537.057s">You</a> have kiosks up and down the street.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12553.317s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12553.617s">They</a> park their vehicles on the opposite side of the garage, on the opposite side of the garage by the railroad tracks. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12559.14s">That's</a> where they park. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12560.421s">Well,</a> anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12563.877s">You</a> don't put them in front of a residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12565.898s">Then</a> you go up to High Street, opposite St. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12568.2s">Claude's,</a> there's two residential homes there and there's a kiosk there next to an apartment. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12571.942s">That's</a> the one I told you, that's scheduled to be removed.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12583.69s">Did</a> the Council get a copy of this walker study? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12586.57s">You</a> got a copy of the walkers? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12588.191s">Point</a> of information.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12599.9s">You're</a> going to take the kiosk, the one on Boston Avenue in front of the, in front of all the, that's not my decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12607.526s">Who</a> made the decision to take the ones off of high street? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12610.849s">The</a> city. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12612.63s">Was</a> the city here chief? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12613.531s">Can</a> you get rid of the ones on Boston Ave? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12617.002s">From</a> the Sacred Heart Church going down on the right-hand side.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12633.252s">How</a> are you going to make that determination? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12634.613s">Does</a> an owner-occupied person have to get a sticker so they don't have to pay?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12647.261s">The</a> Old Sacred Heart Church chief on that side going all the way down. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12651.285s">There</a> are apartments.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12659.027s">You</a> have two parking, you have two kiosks there.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12668.109s">But</a> you have two kiosks there, so if you're worried about students who aren't owner-occupiers, then why can't you give them stickers like you want to maybe give to the seniors so that way they can be identified and they can park there and they don't have to worry about going to a kiosk and putting in a meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12683.893s">Which</a> seniors are you talking about?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12692.957s">You</a> said the seniors.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12694.718s">You're</a> talking about the old Sacred Heart Church. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12696.519s">Forget</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12696.84s">Jesus.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12697.5s">Also,</a> you're losing it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12707.608s">You</a> have kiosks. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12708.128s">How</a> are you going to identify these kiosks at night when it's dark out? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12712.151s">There's</a> no signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12712.772s">Flashlight.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12713.012s">There's</a> no lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12713.672s">There's</a> nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12715.049s">So</a> if somebody's coming into the square, somebody wants to park in this parking lot at the end of the ring road, how are they going to see these two little kiosks in the back of the building that aren't lit up at all, and the people have a huge 150 car parking lot without anything in it? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12730.982s">How</a> are we going to do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12731.922s">I</a> mean, how is that equity compared to a small little businessman who's got a sign in front of a store or a kiosk?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12745.746s">So</a> how do you do this? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12747.307s">These</a> things don't even get illuminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12749.149s">So</a> if somebody decides to come to the square, and they're four or five spaces away from a kiosk, what are they going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12756.494s">Are</a> they going to get out of the car and go looking for a kiosk?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12764.803s">I</a> don't care about this parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12765.943s">This</a> is just an example of one spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12767.904s">Take</a> the other spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12768.984s">You</a> have a small little peak. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12771.224s">There's</a> no light in the top that goes along or anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12773.585s">You</a> said the thing is run by solar. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12776.025s">I'm</a> assuming it has a battery backup. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12777.846s">Why</a> can't you have some kind of a light on it? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12781.086s">So</a> people don't feel like they're getting sucked in if they get a ticket.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12793.621s">How</a> long do you think it's going to take, Chief, the people of this city of Medford who don't watch the council meetings, don't have a computer, or don't utilize it, don't read the newspaper, to get themselves acclimated before they start getting tickets all over the place?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12812.074s">Well,</a> if the learning process is quick, maybe the revenues will be down. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12815.466s">And</a> if the revenues are down, that's gonna mean businesses are in trouble because people aren't gonna do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12819.268s">You</a> know, we could have been the only community around that did not have paid parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12824.27s">You</a> know what that would have meant for business people? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12826.29s">And</a> you know what that would have done to the climate of this community? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12828.732s">Just</a> have enforcement for the hours that are there, whether it's a half hour or an hour or whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12833.574s">You</a> could have a self-medfit. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12834.854s">You</a> have 15 minute, you have a half hour, you have one hour and two hour parking on blocks of stores. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12840.236s">How</a> does that make any sense? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12843.509s">I</a> mean, how did they get to these numbers? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12845.851s">One</a> business has 15 minutes, another one has free parking for a half hour, another one's got a half hour, another one's got an hour.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12857.459s">But</a> Chief.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12890.797s">I</a> didn't build that garage.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12893.798s">It</a> was your friend, the mayor, that didn't help the poor guy that fell through the roof.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12897.279s">The</a> poor guy that fell through the roof that worked at the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12899.059s">That's</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12899.439s">The</a> mayor never went once to see him. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12901.099s">You</a> built the garage. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12902.0s">Never</a> went to see him. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12902.98s">Go</a> ahead.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12923.255s">I'd</a> like to move that we keep this in a full-blown committee on behalf of the taxpayers of this community for the purposes of having a... There is no paper to keep on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12936.419s">We'll</a> make a paper on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12937.62s">Make</a> this the paper on the floor.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12950.999s">What's</a> he want? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12951.499s">I</a> didn't hear him. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12952.019s">What</a> did you say, Rick?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12957.72s">Well,</a> I don't want to wait 60 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12959.04s">I</a> just want to leave it open, so in case we have another opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12961.681s">We</a> have to give them some time to get it done. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12964.321s">Well,</a> we can talk about what took place here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12966.222s">There</a> is no paper before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12967.902s">Well,</a> then we move. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12968.682s">Move</a> the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12969.222s">Move</a> the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12970.183s">Can't</a> come up for 90 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12971.163s">You</a> can move the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12972.943s">I'm</a> going to beat you with the rules, Councilor.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13381.161s">I</a> think the question is pertinent, because you just mentioned Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13384.722s">And</a> if Salem Street, which is a smaller, maybe in width of a street, as compared to other locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13389.564s">But</a> every one of these businesses, at some point in time, has to have some kind of delivery. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13393.786s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13395.447s">So</a> what I don't understand is, <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13399.587s">Why</a> should these republic people even be giving those businesses citation? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13407.334s">I</a> mean, I think that's what Mr. Carroll is asking.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13410.077s">Yeah,</a> if you're saying the other ones is going to, all they're going to be doing is giving, what, tickets?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13416.543s">Why</a> would they be giving a ticket to someone who might be making a delivery? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13419.406s">That's</a> what the question is. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13420.146s">I</a> don't anticipate that that will happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13422.469s">Oh,</a> OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13423.168s">You</a> don't?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13435.315s">And</a> the last part of the question is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13436.776s">If</a> I get a ticket and I have it appealed and I lose my appeal, can I take this to district court? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13441.579s">Where</a> does this appeal go? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13443.06s">You</a> have the option. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13444.741s">What's</a> the next logical, what's the next process after that if you lose your appeal? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13449.004s">Court.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13449.844s">Is</a> it district court? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13450.545s">I</a> believe it is.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13541.106s">What</a> if a car, wait a minute, strike that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13542.427s">What</a> if a car is illegally parked and the delivery has to be made, which forces the delivery truck to go up in the street? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13548.671s">Does</a> that mean the delivery truck is now going to get the ticket?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13558.215s">No,</a> if the vehicle, the delivery truck could not make his delivery because the car that was parked where the delivery truck was going to go is illegally parked or over parked. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13567.758s">So</a> that forces the truck out into the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13569.859s">Does</a> that truck going to get a ticket because of that car that's illegally parked?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13580.982s">Yeah,</a> but you only have two people to go around the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13583.604s">You</a> can't be at every place all at once. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13585.085s">That's</a> impossible.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13622.824s">So</a> when the rubbish truck goes down the street and parks in the middle of the street because there's cars parked on the right, and they're collecting the rubbish off the sidewalk, they will or they won't get a ticket, the rubbish trucks? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13632.99s">We're</a> not going to ticket any rubbish trucks.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13988.175s">Chief.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13989.145s">We</a> chief question. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13993.048s">Can</a> you go back? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13994.329s">I</a> wish the guy from Republic was still here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13996.331s">Can</a> you go back and ask them to change these things here? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13998.512s">Because</a> the residential permit needs to be explained. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=14002.055s">It's</a> $10 and it's $3. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=14003.796s">If</a> you go online to get it, that's $10. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=14006.138s">If</a> you walk in, it's a $3 charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=14008.48s">If</a> you go online and people need to know that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=14011.662s">It's</a> not in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=14012.423s">It's</a> not in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=14013.864s">They</a> need to change these. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=14015.515s">I</a> mean, if this is going to be accurate.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=14018.658s">Well,</a> you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=14019.478s">Well,</a> that's a shame. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=14022.181s">This</a> is just monetary extortion by them. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=14024.763s">$3</a> to go online to get a permit.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_QuIJp-vSiqo/2025-03-21_QuIJp-vSiqo.html">Medford City Council - December 23, 2014</a></h2>

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=683.868s">Yes,</a> the chair was involved too. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=685.969s">But</a> my question is, revolves more around the fact that the hearing was closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=690.211s">Did</a> it need to be re-advertised again? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=691.731s">Cause</a> it was closed cause no decision was made.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=704.037s">I</a> believe the young lady that appeared before the council on that particular night indicated <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=707.772s">that</a> she was willing to go forward with the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=710.033s">And</a> any further questions, she would refer them to Mr. Abruzzese, who unfortunately was not here that night.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=738.058s">But</a> that's not, I'm not worried about what you heard or what you didn't hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=740.599s">I'm</a> more concerned.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=762.377s">I</a> really don't think that's the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=763.558s">I</a> think, you know, I'm not worried about what the public said to you or didn't say to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=766.941s">I</a> think I'm just more concerned.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=806.896s">I</a> didn't expect a dissertation. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=811.779s">I</a> just asked a very simple question that the council <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=815.164s">This</a> is not a normal procedure in the council.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=828.21s">Oh,</a> it's very simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=829.01s">When</a> you postpone a public hearing, it's the advertising. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=833.652s">If</a> you're postponing it, does it have to be re-advertised because you postponed it?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=849.464s">Mr.</a> Clark, what is the procedure on a postponement of a public hearing?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=874.988s">I'd</a> like to ask the court the question, please.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=877.291s">When</a> hearing is either postponed or laid on the table, what is the procedure? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=881.895s">If</a> the hearing comes to an end on that particular night and no decision is made, does it need to be re-advertised? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=886.6s">That's</a> the question.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=921.311s">I'm</a> going to respectfully disagree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=922.811s">I</a> believe councilor, Mr. Brucey, I think, excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=926.173s">I</a> think, I think Mr. Point of clarity, it wasn't that it was to give the courtesy for you to come back to answer any questions, not to take a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=933.795s">That</a> was the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=934.895s">And</a> as the young lady was at the podium, that was her comment last time.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=945.098s">The</a> second question, um, is, is this, <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=952.007s">approval</a> going to the land? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=953.348s">Is</a> it going to Panera? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=954.709s">Is</a> it going to the people on the real estate? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=956.63s">Who's</a> it going to?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=959.091s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=959.532s">I'm</a> asking her the question, please.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=962.474s">I</a> want to ask her the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=963.594s">You</a> don't keep interrupting.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=966.436s">Well,</a> you certainly do. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=967.237s">You</a> do a good job of interrupting. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=968.457s">That's</a> correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=969.578s">Could</a> you please answer the question?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=987.786s">So</a> why isn't Panera itself making the application?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=999.934s">So</a> if Panera were to leave that place and at some time in the future, that's an allowable spot for another drive-through?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=1042.015s">I</a> believe special permits go to the applicant.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=1057.098s">I</a> moved that to make that an amendment that it's Panera as the tenant is the only one entitled to this drive through on the motion as amended by Councilor Penta Councilor Marks.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2301.175s">I'm</a> just going to refer back to some of my original comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2305.616s">I</a> think when Smashburger had its appearance before the Community Development Board and the discussion was there and now we're into Panera. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2314.899s">This</a> is a lot of traffic that's going to be going into this particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2318.94s">And</a> I don't think anyone denies the fact that development for the sake of development sometimes just doesn't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2324.855s">I</a> think we can just look at the development that's taking place in the city of Medford and all the traffic problems that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2331.321s">Wellington</a> Circle's a perfect example. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2334.383s">You</a> know, and just because real estate is hot right now and you can buy and sell and make a pretty good profit, what is that doing to the people that are here that have to live with all this development, whether it's this young lady who just came up here and spoke or what have you? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2351.342s">I</a> understand that the owners of the property, the new owners of the property, they want to do the right thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2356.485s">But</a> I also understand the traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2358.826s">I</a> was down there at 1243 this afternoon, coming off of the Fellsway, going down Riverside Avenue, trying to take a left into the stop and shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2368.692s">And</a> the cars, they were just queued already back. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2370.953s">And</a> this wasn't even prime time. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2372.894s">This</a> was just 12 o'clock, 1215, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2374.455s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2382.167s">So</a> what does that have to do with it?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2386.691s">Well,</a> we can go there on any Friday night or any Saturday afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2389.352s">Forget</a> December 23rd, OK? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2391.114s">And</a> the traffic is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2392.695s">So</a> if you're trying to intimate that it's because it's Christmas, nice try, Councilor Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2398.039s">The</a> fact of the matter is there's a lot of traffic down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2401.782s">Now,</a> I feel that there's a compromise to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2404.403s">I</a> don't see a strong objection from the neighborhood, unfortunately, for that young lady. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2409.767s">But</a> the chief of police is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2410.968s">And</a> chief, maybe you should talk to her and find out what's going on in front of her house where she's trying to do the right thing with her children as a taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2419.953s">I'd</a> like to move approval with a six-month review after the drive-through is open and to have it come back before the council just to see how this thing is working out. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2430.659s">And</a> I think that's a fair compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2431.939s">We've</a> done this in an awful lot of other businesses through the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2436.382s">We've</a> had six months reviews, year reviews, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2439.127s">But</a> this is a big traffic issue that's going to be coming before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2441.449s">And</a> if it's going to work, and as the young lady said, 10 cars in the queue seems to be OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2446.613s">The</a> other gentleman said four to six is normally what normally takes place. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2449.856s">And</a> you have the ability to put 10, then so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2453.119s">So</a> that's what I'm going to move, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2455.301s">I</a> have no problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2456.241s">I'll</a> support it, but with a six-month review.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=3829.14s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=3830.355s">First</a> of all, um, last Thursday after the meeting that took place for West Medford, I met with the, uh, not only the project manager, but the district manager, I spent an hour with them at a local business establishment in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=3842.76s">And</a> we went at it through a whole bunch of issues as it relates to what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=3845.901s">The</a> first one, let's talk about the first one, um, which is the Winthrop street that goes on place that road up to the main entrance to the cemetery. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=3855.599s">in</a> on Boston Avenue, up by the park and garage where Tufts University has theirs. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=3861.063s">Now,</a> they can sit there all day long for $5. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=3865.185s">So</a> first come, first serve, you get $5, it's the best deal of the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=3869.228s">But</a> you go to Medford Square or any one of the squares, you're going to have to put that quarter in that machine every 15 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=3874.371s">And</a> you're going to be subject to whatever the penalty is going to be if, in fact, you don't feed the meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=3879.094s">So</a> in my conversation with them, <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=3881.99s">Their</a> answer was, listen, I'm just telling you what City Hall told us to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=3885.852s">So</a> that's number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=3887.593s">Number</a> two, raising it from one hour to the two hours, that defeats the whole purpose of traffic enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=3894.456s">Just</a> because business people might be complaining over the fact that we're going to be getting an extra hour, that's not what they were asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=3902.34s">All</a> business was asking for in this council, and as the report for which the chief is sitting in the back of the room, dated, I believe, September 2009, your introductory sentence, <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=3911.645s">was</a> a traffic enforcement plan for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=3914.406s">Those</a> people who were violating traffic enforcement during the time periods that the traffic time allowed you, whether it was one hour, two hours, whatever it might be, get a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=3924.21s">This</a> wasn't out there to put money in a meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=3925.971s">It</a> was revenue enhancement, revenue enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=3930.313s">Thirdly,</a> as we continue on, why can't commuters pay more than a business person? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=3939.982s">The</a> small business person in this community is the bloodline, is the lifeline within this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=3945.646s">You</a> start cutting down their walk-in customers, you start cutting into their daily operating finances as a result of worrying about what they're going to have to pay for a permit, or making sure that there's money in the meter, or making sure that they can keep their part-time employee, that's going to hurt them. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=3962.58s">It's</a> going to hurt them an awful lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=3964.72s">So</a> I agree with the fact that commuters should be paying more. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=3967.641s">And</a> for so many years, we've had people from Winchester hustle their way over to Medford, parking in spots, never mind never getting tagged, never even buying a pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=3976.343s">But</a> those that do buy a pass, as recorded downstairs, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=3980.203s">I</a> think that's an issue that needs to be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=3983.524s">Now</a> we heard a little while ago in one of the newspaper comments, I don't know if the reporter is here, <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=3991.127s">When</a> he was speaking to the gentleman who was the president of the chamber, that gentleman of the chamber indicated that all four sections of the city are not the same, and they should be treated and looked upon as that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4003.397s">And</a> then subsequent to that, there was a follow-up story in the newspaper, and for which the gentleman appeared before the council, and saying he never said that, to the reporter right underneath the press, and basically said, you know, we're all gonna work together, and we come up with a plan, and we're working with the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4017.395s">Well,</a> never once during this whole process from 2009 till today, 2014, has any one of the four squares individually and independently met with any group of people from the city of Medford as it relates to their business operation, what do you think we should do, how should we do it, give us your input, and let us see how we can negotiate something that's amicable and peaceful for everybody, if in fact we're gonna go forward with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4042.089s">That's</a> yet to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4043.71s">The</a> gentleman that owns the lock company hit it right in the head. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4046.452s">He</a> has to let go a part-time employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4049.134s">And</a> if he lets that part-time employee go, unfortunately, because he can't afford to pay the $400 rate as it was, now it's been reduced. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4057.178s">We'll</a> get to that next. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4058.659s">But</a> the fact of the matter is, he lets that employee go. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4061.301s">That</a> means he loses a walk-in customer. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4063.282s">That</a> means he loses a sale. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4064.883s">That</a> means he loses some type of potential profit, which means that's going to impede upon his financial capability. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4070.912s">to</a> keep on going, if in fact he's got a business that's just marginal, or he's making a decent salary. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4077.255s">But</a> why should he be penalized for making a decent salary when he's given good service or service to the community? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4083.217s">Now</a> we get today this memo, the first memo that came out today from the Chamber of Commerce. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4088.859s">Great</a> news. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4089.439s">We</a> have wonderful news here. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4091.158s">Things</a> have been changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4092.599s">The</a> executive director says, I wrote a letter, penned it to the mayor and to the traffic commission, and lo and behold, on the same day, a report comes back that the $400 that I'm assuming that the traffic commission initiated, because that's what the republic said, has now been reduced to $100. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4111.388s">Well,</a> there's been no public advertising or posting in the clerk's office of a meeting by the Traffic Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4117.632s">And</a> if the Mayor arbitrarily just did this because of a meeting that took place, that's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4123.175s">And</a> that shows you're right there with the power of this whole thing and where it's coming from City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4128.758s">And</a> then you get another email from another taxpayer in the community who has a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4134.141s">Your</a> concerns will be taken up at the next Traffic Commission meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4137.583s">So</a> you tell me, Mr. Businessperson, and anyone who might be watching out there, what this is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4143.265s">You</a> can't have it one day, you go from 400 down to $100. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4146.166s">Medford</a> City Council's never been advised on any of this, never been brought into a discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4152.528s">The</a> Medford City Council for years has been talking about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4155.669s">The</a> Channel 7 news that took place this past February, where the mayor blamed the council for not giving them the money for residential parking permits was absolutely wrong, it was a lie. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4165.771s">This</a> Medford City Council has supported the police department in all those issues, including that particular matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4172.206s">Then</a> we continue on, Mr. President, relative to the fact about just how lazy people are. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4179.151s">A</a> perfect opportunity for the Medford business people to park behind Route 16 in St. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4184.853s">Joseph's</a> parking lot on a daily basis, and they wouldn't have to be worried about getting tagged of their employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4190.996s">All</a> they would have to do was walk across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4193.697s">And</a> if it's a lighting problem that needs to be straightened out, isn't that a lot easier to do than worrying about a merchant parking in front of his store, or worrying about his employees parking in front of the store, or worrying about the city's not going to get the revenue that it's supposed to be getting? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4207.642s">Wrong.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4208.598s">It's</a> there. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4210.019s">It's</a> a municipal parking lot owned by the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4212.561s">And</a> when the city first took that over, I believe there was a transit trolley, because I was on it with another Councilor, and we picked up merchants in the square, and they went behind there, and they thought it was well. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4223.089s">So</a> when the wintertime comes, if it snows, gets out, or it's raining, you put an umbrella on, and hopefully the city would do what it's supposed to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4229.835s">It</a> plows and shovels, you know, their own municipal parking lot that they have over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4234.966s">All</a> businesses aren't the same in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4237.727s">You</a> can go to one section of the city as compared to another. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4241.509s">But</a> isn't it interesting, when you go to the South Medford area, and you're certain blocks of businesses that have nothing, no signage, no kiosks, and you try to compare them to other parts of the community that have signage and kiosks, then you ask the question, as I did, and the answer was, we're being told what City Hall told us to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4260.837s">We</a> put these kiosks where we were supposed to put them. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4263.698s">Well,</a> that's not going to bode well, because you are going to have businesses now fighting against businesses, because while one business has to toe the mark, another one doesn't because of no signage and no kiosks. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4275.783s">And</a> that's going to be a real problem once this thing gets itself implemented. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4280.445s">The</a> unfortunate part is, and I don't know how the chamber ever got themselves hooked into this thing, it's not the chamber's problem, it's not the chamber's business. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4288.747s">It's</a> the city of Medford's problem, it's the mayor's problem, it's his program, it's his plan, and these public meetings should be taking place here. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4295.969s">Not</a> in the quiet zone of a chamber office, where in one meeting there was four people, another meeting there was 10, another meeting there was 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4302.991s">That's</a> not the true representation of all the communities, all the business people in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4308.393s">You</a> can agree or disagree on what I'm saying, but the true fact of the matter is this whole parking initiative started in May in an executive session when the Medford City Council was asked, because of three people, <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4320.074s">three</a> people who came in, and I have everything here, and I've got the tape, and I've got the minutes of the meeting, three people came in and they said they can only do a 10-year proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4329.059s">And</a> the council went along with the 10-year proposal with one proviso. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4333.041s">You</a> go forward and negotiate with that person, but you also come back and tell us what it would cost if the city of Medford was going to do it, and then we will make the decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4341.226s">And</a> that decision never took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4343.567s">The</a> mayor just went forward with the one that he presented back in May at that point in time, which happened to be Republic, and he went forward with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4351.189s">This</a> is a City of Medford Mayor McGlynn Traffic Enhancement Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4356.11s">But</a> if you want some relief, and you want your voices heard, the only place that can seem to do it is to come before this City Council, and hopefully, hopefully he will listen. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4365.83s">But</a> I'm just astonished how in a period of less than 24 hours, you can go from a $400 fee down to $100. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4372.914s">And</a> you're only going to do it for a year, which means after a year, something's going to happen and change. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4378.558s">But</a> no vote ever took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4380.639s">No</a> commission meeting ever took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4382.7s">No</a> parking board ever discussed this. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4386.383s">Chief,</a> am I saying the right or the wrong thing? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4389.245s">Did</a> you meet between yesterday to today to reduce from $400 to $100?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4424.814s">With</a> all due respect, Chief, this is such a huge major change. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4427.983s">Why</a> wouldn't there have ever been a public meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4430.214s">and</a> have this on a public agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4432.255s">I</a> mean, anybody can call up. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4433.596s">We</a> can call amongst ourselves and pull ourselves.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4440.839s">And</a> $400.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4530.324s">But</a> chief, Medford city council asked to come in with an alternative if the city was going to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4536.175s">Forget</a> the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4537.416s">It</a> could have been private people, could have been retired people, whatever it might have been. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4541.339s">You</a> were part of that committee that went to five of the surrounding cities and towns.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4556.635s">but</a> when you go to Malden, Winchester, and Arlington with this free parking, because of the... Well, they may be looking into it, but the fact that... Point of information, Winchester's putting in meters.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4574.495s">The</a> difference is, and we're going to get into the issue of meters, but I didn't want to, but the difference is a kiosk and a meter, they're like night and day. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4580.999s">People</a> can see the meter and they can understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4582.74s">Well,</a> when you're driving down the street and you've got to figure out five car lengths ahead and look at it, a kiosk, and then you have to remember what your registration number is and it's raining out and you've got a couple of kids in the car, you're a senior citizen or whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4594.368s">It's</a> not a simple meter issue.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4604.027s">I</a> think it's a hurt to the business community too. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4607.169s">We're</a> not, listen, we're not Newbury street in Boston.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4621.708s">We</a> can also have traffic enforcement, and if that's the case, then why did you increase it from one hour to two? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4626.032s">Why</a> not just keep the one, nobody's arguing about increasing the time.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4641.435s">Chief,</a> there are spots in the city where there's signs that say, one hour parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4644.456s">Now</a> it's going to be increased to two. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4646.117s">The</a> signs are already up.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4648.078s">The</a> signs are already up. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4648.798s">Are</a> you going to change all the signs?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4652.54s">There's</a> a lot of one hour parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4655.101s">And</a> how do you justify a $5 all day parking on Playstead Road and on Boston Avenue?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4683.624s">Well,</a> then if that's the case, why don't you just have every parking meter in the city go to $5 a day? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4688.006s">How</a> can you turn around and behind car lanes and that parking lot?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4692.187s">And</a> in that parking lot, Chief, <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4694.075s">As</a> the gentleman said, Mr. Nash, who said from the company, we'll give a $25 ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4698.718s">And</a> they'll sit there all day, and they'll only get one ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4701.199s">Well,</a> what have they accomplished? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4701.999s">They</a> go to Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4702.96s">They</a> don't have to pay $40. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4704.901s">Yes,</a> they do.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4706.802s">Want</a> to make a bet? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4709.624s">Speak</a> to Mr. Nash. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4710.504s">I'll</a> give you his number.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4746.013s">And</a> with that being said.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4750.497s">But</a> with that being said, Chief, and you're a reasonable person. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4753.468s">And</a> I think seven members are reasonable over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4755.609s">This</a> should have all been discussed ahead of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4757.69s">There</a> should have been public meetings to listen to all and what possibly could be the concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4762.171s">That</a> gentleman in the back who started this thing tonight, he shouldn't have had to got himself all worked up over the fact that it started at a $400 clip, and then all of a sudden, within 24 hours, it's reduced to $100 because enough people were complaining. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4774.196s">That</a> young lady shouldn't have to come up here and be worried about not only the business and the enhancement and where the money's going. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4779.398s">This</a> only started off as a revenue, <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4782.472s">Not</a> an enhanced—revenue enforcement.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4795.476s">No,</a> revenue enforcement is very simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4797.436s">If</a> their sign says one hour parking, and that's all there is, you get a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4801.481s">Enforcement</a> enhancement would mean you'd have to go and put the money in the meter for whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4805.444s">And</a> as I said to you before, there were certain elements on Main Street and South Medford that have absolutely nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4811.229s">And</a> they are businesses that have absolutely nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4813.59s">No</a> signage, no kiosks.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4818.454s">Then</a> how does that work, Chief? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4819.555s">All</a> businesses are supposed to be the same.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4853.039s">With</a> all due respect, I will show you two business blocks that one has more multiple businesses than the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4858.721s">They</a> have nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4859.501s">And</a> the other one has a kiosk right in front of their business. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4861.802s">This</a> council voted on the map. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4864.168s">No,</a> the map subject to the- The map we voted on. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4866.45s">Excuse</a> me, Paul. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4867.13s">The</a> map subject to the gentleman- It's council, just as I respect- It was the Walker report that they're going by and what the mayor's office is telling him these are the spots to put them in.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4886.804s">I'm</a> just telling you it's unfair where the kiosk and the meters are going. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4891.848s">There</a> are certain parts of this city that don't have them, Chief, and you know what I'm talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4896.369s">And</a> there are other parts of the city that do have them.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4902.21s">I'm</a> not saying that there is, but it doesn't seem to be fair for certain business blocks to have them and other business blocks not to have them. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4908.652s">Councilor,</a> if you want to expand the program, bring a motion forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4911.472s">Nappies.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4912.312s">There's</a> a bunch of businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4913.073s">Well,</a> let me ask you this, if you're so concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4915.173s">Everybody</a> that works here in City Hall, why is City Hall being exempt? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4918.954s">They're</a> working here. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4919.634s">The</a> kiosks are right out here. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4920.554s">They</a> should put kiosks in here? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4921.554s">The</a> kiosks are right out here. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4922.314s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4923.175s">Absolutely.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4924.955s">No,</a> the kiosk is the parking lot behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4927.436s">Every</a> employee here is like every employee that works for a business. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4930.356s">If</a> they have to pay, then employees at City Hall should have to pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4933.437s">If</a> it's going to be treated the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4938.598s">It's</a> not. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4939.118s">It's</a> not misinformation. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4940.838s">And</a> you're talking from the chair again. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4942.199s">I've</a> got one more meeting.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4945.199s">You're</a> the rudest person I've ever met from that chair, you know that? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=4947.78s">Do</a> you have any more questions for the Chief?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6061.326s">Um,</a> two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6065.427s">You</a> guys went from 100 to 400 and then you had a telephone call to reduce it down to one.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6078.212s">I'm</a> talking about how did you get to 100? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6081.328s">How'd</a> you go from 400 to 100?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6085.21s">But</a> you got that with a phone call. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6086.511s">There</a> was no public meeting, so there was no traffic commission meeting.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6093.876s">No,</a> I understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6094.416s">I</a> understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6094.796s">That's</a> where it came from. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6095.497s">But</a> to make a change like that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6100.74s">So</a> my question to you is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6103.541s">Why</a> would you want to make the change when <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6107.238s">If</a> you can look at this and say, OK, it's $400. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6109.82s">Maybe</a> it's a little excessive. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6110.921s">Maybe</a> you can make it three or two. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6113.223s">But</a> if you're going to make the change for the business person, why can't you just allow all their people to work for them, give them stickers, and just let them come under that one fee?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6136.015s">No,</a> I'm saying, if you get the $100, say you were going to charge the $400, and all the employees that work for that particular company, they have a sticker that gives them the privilege.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6148.538s">They</a> have one employee, they have 10 employees, or whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6150.779s">Is</a> that a motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6151.579s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6151.819s">I'm</a> asking him a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6153.279s">I'm</a> just confused.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6167.415s">So</a> then how are we going to justify, if you're going to do that, going from $400 down to $100, so all these outer towners that are coming here, they're going to still be able to pay $100 a year? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6176.301s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6176.722s">Or</a> what are they going to pay?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6228.957s">But</a> you just got through saying you have out-of-towners, you have residential people, and you have business people. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6232.359s">So</a> how many out-of-towners do we have parking?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6244.586s">So</a> if they're out-of-towners, can't they be charged more for being out-of-towners?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6249.249s">$5</a> a day.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6251.729s">That's</a> a bargain, $5 a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6252.95s">Why</a> can't they be charged?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6260.116s">Yeah,</a> but we discussed this before. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6261.857s">This</a> is not the first time that this has been discussed on the Council of Outer Towners coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6266.06s">So</a> if you're telling me that I can park at the end of Placeton Road for $5 a day as compared to downtown West Medford or downtown Medford Square, and every 15 minutes I've got to put a quarter in there, I'm going to get a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6279.275s">That's</a> what the kiosks are there for. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6280.896s">Well,</a> yeah, if you're packing in the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6282.677s">So</a> I'll go hustle down the street and get the bus that takes me directly to Boston from West Medford, or from Medford Square, or Governors Avenue, $100. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6292.201s">What</a> have we accomplished?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6314.281s">But</a> what about up and down Governor's Avenue? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6315.681s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6318.222s">There</a> are no kiosks.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6324.364s">But</a> where's the enforcement?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6327.785s">What</a> about the parking lot in Medford Square next to the electric company?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6343.845s">I'm</a> going to just end. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6344.386s">This</a> is the only part that I don't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6347.661s">You</a> started in a direction, and now you're just going back and starting from scratch. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6352.665s">I</a> thought the whole idea was to be a revenue enforcement, number one.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6360.772s">Whatever</a> you want to call it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6361.673s">Turnover</a> of parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6362.494s">Whatever</a> you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6363.134s">Turnover</a> of the parking spaces, OK? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6365.056s">I</a> haven't heard anybody from the chamber, anybody, talk about that parking lot on Route 16 being a viable spot for all business people and all employees to park over there.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6387.726s">I</a> don't want to embarrass my colleague, but when we had this conversation a while ago regarding a parking garage, remember? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6393.408s">What</a> did you say? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6394.028s">I'm</a> lazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6394.408s">I</a> want to park right out in front. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6396.827s">And</a> that way there, I don't want to walk. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6398.648s">Well,</a> you know something, you can't have it both ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6400.95s">If</a> you're a business owner and you have employees and you know you have a spot that you can go to and it's a little bit of a walk, at least for this part of the square, that's number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6409.576s">Number</a> two, all the other squares are different. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6411.618s">They</a> don't have that same unique opportunity to have that huge parking lot all day long to park as an owner and employee.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6476.406s">But</a> who makes the determination what section and location of businesses in the city are going to be having a kiosk or a sign?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6515.806s">But</a> who made that decision?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6537.824s">But</a> you have other establishments from Main Street all the way almost back to Medford Square that are businesses that have nothing.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6548.441s">Well,</a> but how do you do it if it's a business person, Chief?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6552.044s">If</a> it's a business person, and I have the same type of a business as you, and one part of the city is competing, and I don't have nothing in front of me, and you do, I'm not going to sit there. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6560.351s">I'm</a> not going to sit there.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6597.972s">Well,</a> speaking with the two gentlemen and I'll conclude on particular issues that they brought up, they were told this is where you go from city hall and these are the places cause they've heard it from other locations, from other folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6611.716s">Why</a> aren't they having it? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6612.956s">So</a> they're being told what to do from city hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6616.08s">And</a> that's not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6617.2s">Who's</a> being told what to do from city hall? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6619.401s">Republic,</a> where to put the signs, where to put the meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6622.762s">Of</a> course.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6626.963s">You're</a> talking about the Walker report. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6629.624s">We're</a> not talking about the Walker report as they've gone around and they've heard all these complaints.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6646.078s">The</a> whole idea was to listen to the business people for which they're listening to. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6649.801s">And</a> when they bring up corollaries or comparisons, they want to know how come in one part of the city someone has another part of the city and another one doesn't have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6658.809s">That's</a> all. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6660.17s">I</a> would suggest you make a motion and bring it forward if you think there should be additional meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6663.833s">You</a> know, I think that the chief and the traffic, what do they call yourself now? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6667.056s">The</a> traffic committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6667.817s">Commission?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6668.177s">It's</a> still a traffic commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6669.418s">Commission</a> is still the same name. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6670.806s">They</a> should entertain any complaint, or any concern, not a complaint, any concern that a business person has as a, you know, if the whole thing- One information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6677.669s">Chief,</a> have you- One information, Councilor Knight.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6710.379s">I</a> disagree.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7096.828s">Point</a> of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7097.828s">Point</a> of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7099.348s">John,</a> the council never voted for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7101.109s">The</a> council only voted for the mayor to negotiate up to 10 years and then come back to the council for a final vote in comparison to <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7110.406s">if</a> the city was going to do it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7136.179s">Absolutely</a> not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7137.48s">That's</a> not what the council voted for. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7138.52s">Mr.</a> Solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7139.04s">That's</a> not true.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7140.741s">Absolutely</a> not true.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7207.993s">I</a> believe that's not the intent. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7209.214s">I</a> believe the intent of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7210.655s">Where's</a> the official minutes of the meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7213.124s">That's</a> not no that was the resolution that was the mayor's document. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7215.886s">That's</a> the mayor's resolution was not amended It was most certainly was council cover yellow when I asked you the question Was it not your opinion that the final vote was have to come before the council?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7244.843s">No,</a> the amendment is right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7246.425s">The</a> amendment is by myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7247.566s">It's</a> amended by myself that the mayor and <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7249.568s">to</a> prefer to end the meeting with the council to explain the program in depth prior to the final decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7255.351s">And</a> we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7255.911s">We</a> did not.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7293.099s">I</a> think the official records, I think the official records tell it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7295.779s">7-0.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7295.96s">Before</a> a final decision is made, he was supposed to come back to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7300.26s">We</a> did.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7330.269s">You</a> got a meeting in September when the council met him there. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7333.491s">We</a> also got a three page piece of document that says not for publication. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7337.794s">It</a> was confidential meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7339.495s">That</a> was a different meeting.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7362.61s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7363.611s">The</a> clarification is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7365.432s">We</a> met in May, and we took a vote as seven members of the council to allow the mayor to go forward to negotiate what Republic at that time was one of three. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7373.837s">And</a> we were told not to say a word to anyone about anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7377.199s">And</a> then in September, we had a meeting when the first draft of the contract came back before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7381.502s">And</a> part of that resolution in May was that it would be explained to us prior to the final decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7387.145s">The</a> Medford City Council never took a vote after May.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7396.27s">Name</a> and address.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7426.956s">That's</a> how it gets up to 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=7428.597s">That's</a> right.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8342.71s">Go</a> ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8344.091s">Some</a> people don't have smartphones. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8345.591s">Some</a> people don't even have a phone. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8347.052s">Some</a> people don't even have computers. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8348.733s">They</a> probably don't have a car then either. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8350.053s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8350.233s">Some</a> people don't go to the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8351.474s">Can</a> somebody come to City Hall and get the permit? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8353.415s">That's</a> the question.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8394.322s">I</a> started to allude to it when I was talking about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8397.853s">Why</a> does Medford have to start at 7 in the morning to 7 at night, when Boston starts at 8 in the morning? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8402.595s">And</a> some of them, all the other Saturdays, why are we 7?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8412.48s">Well,</a> could you make a recommendation to start at 8 instead of 7?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8420.203s">That's</a> absurd, 7 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8422.564s">It's</a> bad enough these businesses are hurting. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8425.125s">This</a> hurts them even more, 7 in the morning.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8433.833s">You</a> know, it's bad enough that the rubbish is all over the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8436.234s">The</a> people put them out ahead of time and that can't be enforced.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8497.657s">Wait,</a> I want to amend it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8498.858s">Wait,</a> whoa, whoa, whoa. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8499.639s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8501.02s">Did</a> you say 60 days?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8503.928s">I'd</a> like to amend it to 30, get a report in 30 days because... 30 days, they're not even going to be ticketing. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8509.191s">Huh?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8509.731s">30</a> days after it starts, after the program starts.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8516.554s">Oh,</a> all right, all right, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8517.595s">I</a> thought you, I thought you, okay, okay.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9774.086s">The</a> moral obligation that we have as a community is to recognize every single person, however they die, dastardly or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9780.508s">We</a> have many, many veterans that have died and they have never received this type of a recognition and they will probably die in the future defending our country, defending another person's land.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9812.822s">We're</a> talking about moral obligations in this <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9815.432s">Council</a> Knight, you can have yours, I have mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9817.452s">And</a> I feel that my moral obligation is to make sure that every single person, however they die in this, whether they lived in Medford or not, or whether they worked in Medford, however they died, they receive like and type recognition. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9829.335s">And</a> you know, Councilor De La Rosa, you're amazed. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9831.835s">How</a> can you be amazed? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9833.196s">You</a> have your opinion, other people have their opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9835.296s">Maybe</a> they don't see it the same way as you. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9837.637s">Maybe</a> the water fountain is something that we really don't need. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9841.017s">You</a> know, for $250,000, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9845.277s">You're</a> still getting the park, you're still getting the ballads, you're still getting the recognition for not only the members that ran and Crystal Campbell and all of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9854.001s">You're</a> doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9855.361s">At</a> the same time, it's kind of like interesting how the mayor can just go around and take a picture, and you were in the picture, we've had this conversation, for whatever the reason is, and presupposes the city council's gonna vote for this back in October. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9868.426s">Pictures</a> in the local newspaper, standing there with the big check for $299,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9873.684s">We</a> never even discussed this for a vote, never mind whether we wanted to do it or we didn't want to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9878.167s">And</a> we talk about the money used for PACs. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9880.229s">Most</a> recently, I don't know how a guy does this. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9883.351s">He</a> went to a, I believe, a Schreyer Auditorium meeting most recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9888.656s">Excuse</a> me, the mayor went to the Schreyer Auditorium and he committed $5,000 to them to celebrate their anniversary that's coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9897.235s">Where</a> was the vote on the council on that?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9899.816s">Point</a> of information.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9908.3s">What</a> does that have to do with dislikes of the air? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9910.002s">You've</a> got a financial obligation in this community to make sure how the money is spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9914.346s">And</a> for the man to go and make a commitment, whether it be $5,000 or $299,000 on behalf of this council, is wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9920.853s">It's</a> absolutely wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9922.255s">It's</a> unnecessary, and it's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9924.978s">If</a> any one of the members of this council went ahead and did that, you know where we'd be right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9928.721s">We'd</a> be brought up on charges. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9930.769s">That's</a> the way we'd be.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9936.391s">You</a> may have known about it, Lauren, but none of us knew about it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9948.215s">They</a> want to fund it, but this hasn't been discussed over here to find out what's going on.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10166.989s">But</a> Lauren, with all fairness to everybody, he may have had his press, but this has never been presented until last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10173.995s">But</a> the council never took a vote on it, whether they forwarded it or against it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10179.598s">He's</a> talked to several members of this council, including myself on this particular matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10183.179s">Well,</a> maybe he talked to you, but he didn't talk to me.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10186.581s">Why</a> should I have to pick up the phone? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10187.862s">This</a> is his project, not mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10189.622s">Well,</a> I'm proud to be part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10190.903s">That's</a> all I can say. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10192.224s">So</a> let's get back to the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10194.405s">Excuse</a> me. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10194.705s">You</a> had a point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10195.645s">Yeah,</a> I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10196.225s">I'm</a> talking. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10196.786s">Get</a> back to the issue now. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10197.746s">Go</a> ahead.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10226.902s">Why</a> do you say, you're asking us for a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10229.703s">That's</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10230.283s">And</a> if the vote is $250,000 less than what this is.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10236.906s">Well,</a> if the mayor says this is part of, this is not part of the million dollars, this is an, <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10241.948s">an</a> excess of it, then let them go to win to get the other $250,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10244.709s">All</a> we're saying is, all I'm saying is- Why would you do that?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10250.27s">Councilor,</a> you made your point of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10252.07s">I</a> will vote for the park grant, but I'm not going to vote for the $250,000 because of other issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10257.531s">You</a> can place that pocket that's in desperate, desperate need of upgrading. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10261.772s">And</a> nothing, there's not a dime going over there.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10471.73s">Go</a> ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10474.831s">I'm</a> not afraid of making a no vote on this particular matter tonight because I'm just, I don't know when it's going to stop in this community, but I am never going to have my vote be presupposed by the mayor of this community on anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10486.794s">He's</a> presupposed this council on linkage on this particular matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10490.496s">He</a> has presupposed this council on taking money from free cash without offering us any opportunity of our input. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10497.466s">He</a> has taken money by raising water and sewer rates, again, without no input from this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10504.035s">We</a> have so many issues within this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10506.93s">that</a> need to be looked at that have really presented itself with some taxpayer concerns, whether it's the new parking meters or whatever it might be, the buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10518.974s">Our</a> own building right here, it could collapse at any day. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10521.495s">We</a> don't even know if it's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10523.115s">Well</a> over a year old, not taking care of your own house that you live in. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10526.556s">I</a> just can't see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10528.637s">And</a> if the Campbell family is looking, <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10531.978s">I</a> apologize if you think that this is a vote against your daughter, but it is not a vote against your daughter. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10537.221s">I'm</a> looking at the fiscal and the financial responsibility that I have before here. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10541.003s">As</a> I said to you before, I've got no problem in cutting this in half. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10544.285s">As</a> I said last week, I think there's a leftover $500,000, and you could build a beautiful memorial over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10553.371s">But,</a> you know, this is just another <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10555.804s">Huge</a> event that the mayor is going to pull off, and it's just another place where he's going to put his stone there with his name here, Michael McGlynn, and memory of, and this and that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10563.749s">And</a> that's great, if that's what he needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10565.41s">If</a> that's what he needs to survive. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10566.911s">I</a> don't need that to survive.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10602.131s">I</a> hear— Let me turn that on. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10604.593s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10625.424s">They've</a> done their patriotic duty. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10627.225s">Go</a> look in front of Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10629.605s">You</a> got a plaque over there that hasn't seen an ounce of restoration. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10633.867s">An</a> ounce of restoration. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10635.007s">Look</a> at all the names of the people on there from World War II that have died, that have never seen their names restored, that gave the ultimate sacrifice. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10643.49s">This</a> girl unfortunately died. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10645.851s">She</a> was murdered by a terrorist, and I hope he gets his due when he goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10650.437s">but</a> to spend a million three at this point in time, at that particular location with that kind of money, knowing, knowing that 250,000 of that could be used for anything else in this community.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10675.617s">One</a> last thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10676.557s">Lauren,</a> we went to the meeting and the mayor said the phone was coming off the hook. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10679.398s">The</a> phone was ringing. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10680.439s">He</a> only got $4,375 in miscellaneous contributions. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10685.881s">$250,000</a> he took from when? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10688.162s">The</a> only other outside contribution was from Cummings, $100,000 that he earmarked. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10693.004s">So</a> where is all this money that the phone was ringing off the hook?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10741.491s">So</a> he got the $4,375. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10742.252s">That's</a> what he would have gotten?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10751.117s">When</a> did the mayor ever come before the council and say, listen, I'd like to do this in memory of Christine Campbell. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10755.519s">I'd</a> like to make an application. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10756.599s">Would</a> you guys support it? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10757.72s">He</a> has never one of these things here. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10759.34s">He's</a> coming for the council.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10761.041s">Well,</a> that's the whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10761.881s">He</a> doesn't have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10762.541s">He</a> has to go to council now to accept this. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10763.701s">So</a> if he doesn't have to, then we don't have to either.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_uLCwC5-x-as/2025-03-21_uLCwC5-x-as.html">Medford City Council - December 16, 2014</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=777.128s">We're</a> in a clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=778.089s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=779.009s">And</a> even though we know that, but this administration has been there for 27 years and they haven't put a dime on the table to get into funding that unfunded liability. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=786.414s">And</a> as you and I had our conversation and I put a resolution on here, we could stop by putting 500,000 a year out of our free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=793.078s">Is</a> it a drop in the bucket? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=794.078s">It's</a> a beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=794.839s">Well,</a> the thing with the beginning, he hasn't done anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=797.327s">The</a> administration has done nothing to reduce that fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=800.029s">You're</a> talking about the OPIP? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=801.15s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1251.538s">I</a> see this a little bit different. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1253.139s">We</a> had $7.9 million, I believe, in free cash a couple of weeks ago, two or three weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1260.566s">Then</a> the mayor came in here with his particular pet projects for which the council has never advised or asked on any one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1268.452s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Knight.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1278.661s">Thank</a> you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1281.083s">Mr.</a> President, I believe that the mayor came in with his pet projects that took money from free cash and reduced it by $1.2 million, and then took another amount of money as it relates to where he would want to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1296.088s">Anyway,</a> to make a bottom line to the whole thing is, for some reason or other, we've accumulated surpluses in two very large areas that belong to the taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1305.991s">The</a> first one is in the water and sewer account. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1307.571s">The</a> second one in here is in the free cash account. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1310.3s">Now,</a> as Ann Baker has alluded to, maybe we've been fortunate over the past few years, whether they be the car excise tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1315.923s">And</a> I think in our conversations, again, you talked about Medicaid, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1318.784s">We</a> got some reimbursements back from them for which we didn't expect. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1322.226s">So</a> that's helped us out in our issue of having a free cash surplus for whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1328.149s">But</a> there is no projects that are pending that are coming here now before the council asking for council input as it relates to whether it be the police station, whether it be putting more police personnel on. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1340.548s">And</a> then to flip to all of that, isn't it interesting, during this past budget, the school committee wound up with $2 million more this year than they did last year, and they went out and hired a whole bunch of more new people, for which the council was never asked of anything on the council's side of adding on to this budget, or any things to be included. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1357.023s">I'm</a> glad I voted for the budget, because I voted for the budget to get rid of the $800,000 and the water and sewer that, unmercifully, the taxing the ratepayers in this community of. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1365.492s">But</a> anyway, sticking to this, I don't see any problem taking the million dollars out, and I'll tell you the reason why. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1370.294s">Maybe</a> next year we won't have the opportunity to do it, but there is nothing before me on this table right now that's telling me there is such a major project that needs to be done that we need that surplus, because that surplus has been there over and over. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1381.894s">for</a> the past few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1383.375s">And</a> we've been getting over and over for the past few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1385.536s">We</a> need to keep it in there to keep our bond rating up. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1388.737s">Well,</a> where's our bond rating going at the expense of the ratepayers each and every year getting an increase in their taxes? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1395.2s">Now,</a> Councilor Caraviello, you just asked a question on that single-family house. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1399.101s">It's</a> $48 you would save, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1402.643s">And</a> at the present tax rate, he'd be paying over what? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1404.964s">$150</a> some odd. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1405.304s">And</a> for a two-family house, Ed, and a three-family house. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1409.846s">Figure</a> that out and see how much they'd get. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1412.056s">It</a> may not be much, but at least you're telling the taxpayers of this community for once, after 27 years, they're not getting a tax rate increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1420.158s">We</a> have the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1422.259s">We're</a> not taking all the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1423.759s">We</a> have the money.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1455.874s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1456.654s">With</a> all due respect, Anna, I've seen it in the city of, I've seen it in the city of Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1460.155s">I've</a> seen it in the city of Everett through the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1461.916s">Tax</a> rates have either gone down or been stabilized. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1464.092s">But</a> that's not the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1465.675s">You</a> know, the fact of the matter, we've had a plentiful amount of new development here in the city of Medford through the years, a plentiful amount of development. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1473.367s">And</a> we were told when stations landing came in, that was going to be the panacea of new tax growth in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1478.27s">which</a> would set the base. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1479.411s">It's</a> gone up and up and up. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1480.651s">And</a> since then, we've had four major developments of housing in this community, whether it be at Wellington Circle, whether it be on the Mystic Valley Parkway, whether the new one that's being proposed opposite the train station, or whether the new one down the street at the end of station, not stations landing opposite where the Tufts Boathouse is. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1497.18s">But</a> that's not the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1498.141s">The</a> fact of the matter is, we're not taking the last penny in the free cash account. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1502.759s">If</a> what Councilor Lungo-Koehn is alluding to, averaging out the last three years to take out a million dollars or 899,000, whatever it might be, it still leaves you with a balance in excess of $6 million.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1552.403s">But</a> the higher assessments that Mr. O'Neill's proposing comes up to $3,805,800,926. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1560.755s">And</a> in this year, in the budget, you have a new capital growth expansion of $999,941. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1566.678s">That</a> means the budget from last year to this year is expected in growth to increase by $4,805,867. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1574.39s">And</a> all the council is alluding to is if you knock off a million of that money by taking it out of your free cash and giving the homeowners a break. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1582.497s">That's</a> all. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1582.977s">We're</a> not saying take the whole thing out, but there is money there to give these people a break. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1588.061s">You're</a> getting new growth in revenue and you're getting new growth and business and you're having two more new buildings come on next year and that'll be more new taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1598.55s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1599.23s">To</a> say that, you know, we tax each and every year is symptomatic. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1602.353s">Well,</a> if it's symptomatic, you know, we're all going to die someday, and that's symptomatic, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1607.237s">But</a> government can do something to help people rather than abuse them by saying, give me more money, give me more money, give me more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1614.323s">And</a> the only way you can give them more money is tax them to death.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2059.917s">On</a> that 2010, Mr. President, it was $544,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2061.037s">We're</a> sitting on $7,594,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2061.798s">So</a> there's a huge difference, even <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2070.387s">even</a> if you did go into the negative field next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2072.909s">We're</a> talking about this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2074.049s">You've</a> got $7,594,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2076.571s">That's</a> a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2077.752s">And</a> we're only talking about taking a million out. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2080.293s">Thank</a> you, Councilor.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2115.877s">It</a> might seem that way, but the Water and Sewer Commission just came out with their new rate structure, which is picking up during the course of the year, the difference for which this council voted for it, which is $800,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2125.261s">It</a> was $800,000.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2264.576s">What</a> does popularity mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2266.471s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2266.971s">There's</a> a motion for approval on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2269.412s">As</a> you're referring to an administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2273.554s">It's</a> a very hard community. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2274.575s">I</a> mean, real estate wise, real estate wise. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2277.196s">And</a> well, we, you know, we just got through talking about the state legislature passing a budget and they passed the budget knowing there was a $325 million deficit in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2285.82s">Well,</a> that to me doesn't make them look like they're very, <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2288.838s">They</a> have a lot of brains up there to figure out that they have a $325 million budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2292.799s">Rep</a> Donato's doing a fine job in my eyes. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2294.62s">We're</a> not talking about Representative Donato. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2296.2s">We're</a> talking about the state legislature.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2299.541s">Oh,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2300.001s">That's</a> in your opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2300.902s">Bottom</a> line is this.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2304.162s">I</a> don't see a cake on the table here do you? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2306.023s">Next</a> week. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2306.643s">Next</a> week. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2307.083s">Good.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2307.383s">Bring</a> it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2308.244s">The</a> bottom line to the whole thing is if you're astute as to what you're doing here and your local government and making sure that you're taking care of the taxpayers the best you can, <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2316.722s">Is</a> this a borderline issue for you? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2318.103s">Maybe</a> it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2318.923s">For</a> me, it isn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2319.904s">Because</a> right now I feel comfortable in saying yes to getting rid of a million dollars because we're not down to the ground zero. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2325.707s">We're</a> not at 1 million, 2 million, 3 million, 4 million, 5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2328.829s">We're</a> at $6.2 million left. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2331.591s">And</a> with that being said, I've got no problem with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2333.912s">And</a> I don't think any taxpayer out there would have a problem with it either because there's nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2337.883s">before</a> this podium, before this council, of a great magnitude that needs this money to be spent, other than the unfunded liability for the pensions and the OPED. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2347.611s">And</a> we haven't seen anything from the mayor, and that's been at his desks since September.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2362.958s">It</a> was you, Councilor Caraviello, on your first term. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2365.52s">It</a> was in the beginning of your second year of your first term, you produced a paper that said the school department was $1,200,000 in debt, and they haven't done anything to correct it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2374.427s">But</a> they just hired $2 million.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2481.459s">Can</a> you call the roll, please?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3260.274s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3261.155s">The</a> reason why that that was ordained because everyone else was mixed into that vote.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3268.958s">You</a> just read it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3636.293s">President,</a> I make a motion to sever the motion to allow Councilor Lengelkorn's motion to prevail.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3665.344s">No,</a> that will stay the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3666.965s">That</a> will stay the same.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3806.41s">Move</a> the question.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3965.954s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4032.238s">You</a> gave us, Mr. O'Neill, you gave us some examples of what the rate would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4042.086s">I</a> did some research as it relates to our sister city of Somerville, which is up to 35%, and I guess my question to you is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4054.595s">If</a> in fact the city decides to vote this either yes or no, is this one of, is this, <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4062.363s">one</a> of the four things we're going to vote on that could be changed at any time during the forthcoming year? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4068.685s">In</a> other words, this has to be adopted now, yes or no? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4071.626s">Or</a> could this number three be put on hold?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4100.044s">No,</a> they're up to 35. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4101.024s">They</a> would have proved up to 35%.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4104.606s">The</a> question is this, if the council votes, however, they vote a number three, which is this one coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4109.589s">And</a> this one says up to an extension of 20%. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4112.771s">If</a> the council were to vote to change that, strike that vote to accept the exemption, <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4118.168s">and</a> change the number, 5, 10, 15, 20, 20%, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4123.511s">When</a> does that become effective on the tax base rate? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4127.513s">Would</a> that be after July 1st of 2015, or would it be January 1st of 2016?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4150.747s">No,</a> you're not answering the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4152.448s">If</a> the council votes to do this after this vote tonight, at some point in time between January and June of this 2015, when does this become operative? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4165.354s">July</a> 1st or January 1st of 2016?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4171.597s">No,</a> you're still not missing.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4176.653s">We're</a> not voting for this right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4177.954s">We're</a> not voting for an exemption right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4179.816s">Let's</a> just say we discussed this and in either March or April, the council decides they're going to impose the residential exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4187.665s">When</a> does that become operative in the budget for the purposes of the budget or the tax rate? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4192.85s">Is</a> it July 1st or January 1st, 2016?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4206.755s">You're</a> not listening.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4219.325s">You</a> just got through saying without a home rule petition, you can go up to 20%.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4228.226s">But</a> what happens if we decide we want to vote on this in April or May? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4231.549s">What</a> do we need? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4232.43s">We</a> need a home rule petition or can we just vote on it?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4294.68s">Fourth</a> time. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4295.18s">Let</a> me ask you this.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4299.706s">Well,</a> maybe you're not answering the question correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4302.308s">If</a> you pass it right now, if you pass the question right now, yes or no, and the council decides in April or May they want to go to the exemption of 20%, which doesn't become operative, as you say, until January of the following year, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4319.162s">Do</a> you still need a home rule petition for that or not?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4329.411s">Then</a> let me ask you this. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4330.932s">If</a> you wait until next year at this time when the council votes up to 20% for a tax exemption, how are you going to have that figured out on this night? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4339.698s">Wouldn't</a> you have to discuss this ahead of time and give us an example of what the breakdown would be and what the cost is going to be by taxes? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4347.456s">I</a> mean, it would be kind of stupid to come here on a night like tonight and all of a sudden vote for 20% exemption and not knowing what the rates are going to be.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4356.99s">No,</a> no, I'm talking about having a legitimate conversation, Ed. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4360.81s">not</a> just having a piece of paper thrown at us ahead of time.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4383.268s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4823.577s">Ed,</a> you have a $546,300 base for 10% exemption at any house valued above that, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4836.831s">That's</a> correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4839.153s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4839.493s">Um,</a> and then you, and you indicated that represents 1,279 parcels. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4846.158s">And</a> of all these parcels in the city, you said there's 2,309 non owner occupied parcels. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4854.625s">Uh,</a> that's the number you gave us.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4865.792s">No,</a> no, you gave us $2,309 non-owner-occupied.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4894.226s">That's</a> what I want to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4895.066s">What's</a> the value? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4896.266s">How</a> high?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4928.827s">We</a> get a break, but we haven't done before. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4931.127s">We</a> haven't taken from five 46 300 and gone forward to say between five 46 to 600,000 and then from 600 to 700,000 to get to that number of 1000.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4949.765s">So</a> if 501 was a break even last year, and it's been increased by 45,000 this year, because of the appreciation, that's a pretty, that's a pretty big appreciation to property value. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4958.108s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4958.628s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4959.169s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4959.449s">So</a> if a house between five 46 and 600, I'd like to move Mr. Clark, write this down, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4966.672s">I'd</a> like to get the breakdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4967.712s">You</a> don't have to do it for tonight between five 46 to six, six to six 50, six 50 to seven, all the way up to the minion that you said. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4975.85s">And</a> then I'd like to see the tax rate broken down to that, because I don't think it's as bad as everyone seems to think it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4981.173s">I</a> mean, if you have a house that's worth $600,000, $650,000, and you're going to pay a few dollars more, it's a lot better than at least you're giving something back to someone who can't afford a $600,000 house. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4993.341s">And</a> again, it's another way of giving a break. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4996.924s">Which</a> motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4998.865s">I'm</a> talking to him.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5002.941s">No,</a> he works for us too. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5004.682s">Your</a> motion to the clerk is? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5006.423s">Is</a> to have the assessor's office break down from 546,300 to 600,000 and $50,000 increments. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5013.608s">Up</a> to a million. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5014.508s">Up</a> to a million. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5015.549s">And</a> how that would affect the 1,279 taxpayers increase in taxes that they'd be paying. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5023.654s">For</a> example, do you have your calculator?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5062.41s">So</a> there's a little bit higher. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5063.17s">So</a> that's another $144,000.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5110.79s">So</a> if you can bring us that back in some kind of a chat, <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5113.668s">We</a> can see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5114.729s">Because</a> there is some merit to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5116.63s">It</a> doesn't have to be $15, $20.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5127.899s">Yeah,</a> but how many people in the city can afford $800,000, $900,000 homes? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5130.821s">$560,000</a> in Medford.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5148.404s">Give</a> us that one there, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5150.285s">That</a> 10%. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5151.386s">The</a> one that you have, the average is 546, 300. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5153.648s">That's</a> the cutoff.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5164.217s">So</a> that being said, even though it's 1,279 homes, <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5169.342s">You</a> have to look at between the 5 to the 6, the 6 to the 650, 650 to the 7.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5197.355s">Let</a> me go ask you this. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5198.135s">Now,</a> let's go back to someone who has a house worth $400,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5202.678s">What's</a> the tax rate right now?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5209.401s">But</a> with a 10% exemption, they'd be paying even more than less. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5212.183s">That's</a> correct.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5216.725s">So</a> it has a value of one.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5222.708s">But</a> you're also getting at $2,309 non-owner-occupied <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5227.338s">And</a> they're going to be paying at a higher rate, too.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5264.185s">So</a> for the year 2015, we could, we could still operate with these numbers.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5315.484s">But</a> for what you have right now, you could give us a sample for what I just asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5320.287s">If</a> we would have, you know, it's kind of go up or down, whatever it's going to be next year.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5347.484s">But</a> you also have the non-owner occupied, and that's what we're trying to address.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5352.128s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5353.229s">So</a> do that, Mr. Clark. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5356.551s">You</a> got it?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5671.961s">On</a> that last vote that we just took, I believe that vote was on my resolution for Mr. O'Neill. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5676.765s">I</a> didn't believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5677.425s">We</a> didn't get to you actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5679.467s">I</a> move reconsideration to have it reconsidered.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5683.35s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5697.72s">Yes,</a> I vote yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5699.642s">Move</a> reconsideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5700.623s">I'd</a> appreciate.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6246.904s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6248.285s">Two</a> points, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6249.766s">Um,</a> on the section 50 dash 65, it talks about appointments and it says the appointments of the human rights commission, the mayor shall appoint. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6258.213s">Apparently</a> he's appointing all the members. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6260.935s">Is</a> it there anything within your membership? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6263.959s">that</a> would go out of bounds, so to speak, and you folks elect members for someone who might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6269.302s">Why</a> are these nine members all mayoral appointments?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6307.147s">So</a> who advertises for these positions, the mayor or the commission?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6318.54s">You</a> put an ad in the paper.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6325.505s">So</a> what would be the best since you're merging these two together? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6328.047s">What's</a> the background of the members who are on the commission? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6331.369s">Um,</a> are they here tonight? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6332.17s">Any</a> of them?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6340.176s">They</a> just come up, you know, this is brand new. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6342.157s">Maybe</a> if they come up and explain, <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6343.92s">their</a> position, the people who might be watching.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6346.701s">This</a> is a major blend of two commissions.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6381.229s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6381.53s">Could</a> you just explain what's your interest and why are you involved? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6384.392s">How</a> did you get involved with this?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6605.035s">Is</a> there any, um, to the chair, is, is, is there any involvement, um, with you as being the chief or having a police person on the board and now with the merger of these two organizations together, <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6619.18s">And</a> not to bring up a sour issue, but unfortunately we've seen what's happening recently throughout this country regarding the police department, whether you're for or against, whatever the action might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6630.684s">Is</a> it possible that this commission can take an attitude of just going out into the community rather than waiting for an issue to appear before it and just see what's going on and see what their attitude is and whether it's human rights for the purposes of social issues, police issues, educational issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6649.231s">rather</a> than just having a meeting at City Hall, going into the neighborhoods and finding out what the possibilities are. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6655.235s">What</a> are your problems?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6703.718s">But</a> wouldn't this be a perfect opportunity for which a lack of better terminology <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6710.191s">not</a> for community policing, but for maybe community involvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6713.873s">I</a> mean, to me, this is big, merging these two commissions together to accomplish one goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6719.336s">And</a> I'm going to assume that the goal is to make sure that this community, you know, is looked upon favorably by all kinds of people for whatever, whether they're people of color, whether it's disability, whether it's a police issue, whether it's an educational issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6731.822s">I</a> mean, you can really run the gamut here and be such an adjunct to city government <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6737.533s">in</a> such a way, I mean, you have terms here that run three years, two years, and one year. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6740.974s">So</a> you're not always getting the same individual because the person, maybe you have one year, maybe all done, he may or she may not want to come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6748.917s">I</a> just see this as an open door policy that can really, this city is changing so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6755.399s">And</a> I think this is an absolute unique opportunity to get into the bowels of every corner of this city with this commission, committee, whatever you want to call it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6763.942s">And</a> this is what I would be expecting. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6766.673s">this</a> committee and commission to do.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6900.43s">So</a> that's one of the objectives of this commission?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6916.49s">So</a> the membership of the commission, how many?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6921.633s">And</a> how many of the Human Rights Committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6923.574s">I</a> mean, you merged the two together.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6939.608s">But</a> you're down to nine now. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6940.809s">You're</a> having nine members. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6941.69s">Yes,</a> we're keeping it at nine. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6942.991s">But</a> how many did you have between the two altogether? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6944.812s">How</a> many were there?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6948.495s">Before</a> you merged, the two commissions separately— We're both nine.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6965.728s">And</a> what do you have, a one- or a two- or a three-year vacancy? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6967.809s">Which</a> vacancy is it?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6971.313s">You</a> also go to section 5066, meetings and quorum. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6975.674s">And</a> this is the one that I think I would make a suggested change. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6978.435s">It</a> says, when enough members are present to constitute a quorum, a majority of those present shall be sufficient for any action taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6984.916s">So</a> if only five out of nine show up, you're going to tell me three out of five and the decision? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6989.676s">No,</a> no, no.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6995.037s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6995.297s">But</a> it also says a majority of those present. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6997.798s">So</a> if five show up, <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6999.315s">and</a> a majority of five is three, they're going to set the tempo for nine members?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=7006.919s">Section</a> 50-66. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=7007.339s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=7020.006s">But</a> this doesn't say that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=7024.368s">Those</a> present. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=7026.229s">Those</a> present shall be sufficient.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=7030.93s">But</a> it doesn't say that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=7033.672s">Maybe</a> that should say that and not of those present. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=7036.154s">It</a> says a majority of those present.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=7046.962s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=7049.163s">I</a> want to amend that last line. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=7051.085s">After</a> the word majority of, it should say a majority of the commission and eliminate the words <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=7057.334s">and</a> those present out of section 50-66, meetings quorum, that's the headline.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8522.842s">Love</a> to hear from you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8524.022s">Um,</a> we've had many conversations about this as you know, and it's not that I'm opposed to the garden, but in part I'm opposed to the expenditure of this large amount of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8537.055s">I</a> also have an issue as it relates to how it's being dedicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8542.858s">I</a> believe, unfortunately, what happened to this young lady shouldn't have happened to anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8550.462s">But</a> she and three others who the mayor has decided to nominate the dedication to be for, I think it misses the boat about all the people that really did get hurt and killed and some people damaged for the rest of their lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8566.567s">Two</a> parts that I don't agree with on this, as I attended the meeting in, what was it? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8573.911s">The</a> linkage meeting back in- April. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8576.552s">April</a> 16th of this past year. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8577.873s">And</a> the mayor at that point in time indicated, quote, that people are calling off the phone wanting to make contributions. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8585.336s">And</a> as we have indicated here tonight, with the paper that you've submitted, <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8594.793s">$475</a> on miscellaneous contributions. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8597.854s">Now</a> I look at the wind contributions of $250,000, two separate ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8602.656s">It</a> was this Medford City Council, I believe in January of last year, between Councilor Lengel and myself, who introduced resolutions on the matter of the wind casino being a community next door, having a preference as to, you know, what our position should be, who I believe there were seven resolutions between Councilor Lengel and myself, <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8623.145s">passed</a> forward as it relates to the impact of that casino that was sent to the mayor, and the mayor never once responded back to this council, never once asked us in part of mitigation and as a surrounding community what we would be looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8635.988s">And</a> if I remember correctly, he himself submitted a document to the Mass Gaming Commission indicating money to be used for the Wellington area for program study, for the traffic impact, and I believe there was another one as it relates to the Wellington Circle intersection over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8652.457s">taking</a> that and coming forward and now recognizing that Wynn has given us $250,000 and never once has the mayor ever come to this council and just saying, listen, I've got $250,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8664.399s">I'd</a> even like to use part of it at this park over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8667.62s">What</a> would you guys and ladies like to do with it? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8669.68s">Nothing,</a> never, no response, absolutely zero as it relates to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8674.261s">And</a> then we get the $100,000 contribution from the Cummings Foundation and that's all well and good. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8679.342s">If</a> he felt that he wanted to submit that, get the $100,000, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8684.624s">But</a> now you're taking the $475,000 from, which was originally going to be the mayor's water taxi park development over there on Clippership Drive, for which, again, council never, no public hearing ever took place before this council to ask for our recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8702.39s">And</a> as you alluded to earlier this evening, even though it's a federal grant, a lot of the times, <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8707.855s">cities</a> and towns make the request and there's no votes that are taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8710.818s">Well,</a> it would have been nice to have a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8713.56s">I</a> don't have the exact date in front of me. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8715.261s">From</a> my understanding, I believe that the mayor, our state representative, and yourself took a picture less than a month ago indicating that the city of Medford was receiving this $299,000 grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8727.751s">A</a> great presumption by this mayor of how this council would vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8732.014s">And</a> I think the time has come that this has got to stop. $1,300,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8737.438s">$1,300,000</a> for this particular garden. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8741.701s">This</a> is all the mayor's doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8743.562s">There's</a> been no interaction with the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8746.223s">There's</a> been no action for inclusion with the city council of what we would like. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8751.186s">You</a> know, there was another individual who unfortunately died in that bombing when it took place at the marathon. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8758.89s">And</a> in that community, we'll leave it nameless, in that particular community, that individual has a nice little grave with a nice little stone with a flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8766.893s">and</a> a plaque that identified how and why. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8769.834s">No</a> multi-million dollar peace garden. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8774.034s">And</a> when I think of this, and I think of all the veterans that are in our cemeteries, and the ones that are going to war now, and the ones that are going to be dying now, and the ones that will be dying in the future, they don't get this million dollar peace garden. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8787.257s">And</a> this is not even being dedicated to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8789.117s">It's</a> just being dedicated to how this memorial is basically being set up. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8793.018s">It</a> was the marathon of some two years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8795.125s">And</a> as the gentleman tonight so nicely explained delicately where all these spots are going to be and the compass that's going to be used, you know, and the references to along the way, the 26 mile way would give you an idea of where the marathon took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8808.97s">I</a> want to make this clear, especially to the Campbell family, if they're watching and if they have any sense of understanding of what I'm trying to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8814.852s">It</a> was a tragedy and I understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8818.994s">And</a> there's nothing I or anyone else can do to bring back your daughter. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8823.3s">But</a> this community, I believe, should have had more of an interaction. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8826.863s">This</a> city council should have had more of an interaction. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8829.365s">This</a> mayor should have been more interactive with us, rather than going on his whim of, I'm going to develop this million dollar peace garden. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8838.091s">For</a> which, completely, it keeps commentary, keeps coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8841.634s">It's</a> going to be mostly used by the seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8844.756s">Well,</a> to me, that's not what the peace garden should be about. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8847.278s">It</a> should be mostly used by the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8849.24s">It's</a> at an intersection that's highly visible by an awful lot of traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8852.437s">but</a> there's going to be no place for them to stop and park. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8855.218s">And</a> if it's going to be used by the seniors, sure, the memorial for the seniors, they're going to pass on. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8860.581s">As</a> the memorial that we have up in the high school on Winthrop Street, it's there for those kids to see each and every day to give them a remembrance of the fellows and the ladies that pass on because they went to war to defend our country and for the freedoms and privileges of other folks and other countries and other lands and for other opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8878.93s">I</a> think a scaled-down approach <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8881.316s">would</a> be much more palatable. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8882.957s">I</a> think the monies, if this city has this unique opportunity, and you certainly do a good job of getting money for parks and recreation in this community, there's no question about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8892.66s">But</a> I think if the efforts could be geared into another direction for community use. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8899.935s">I</a> know you're dealing with a deficit. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8901.395s">You</a> have a very small office, maybe two people at the very most, two and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8906.716s">Go</a> to your sister city in Somerville, and they've got 13 and 14. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8910.117s">And</a> that's the reason why they're way ahead of us as it relates to development and things to be done, because they can spread their wings and look at things. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8917.098s">The</a> Peace Garden started off as a priest garden. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8920.338s">Then</a> they said they didn't attach a name to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8922.339s">Then</a> now they're attaching a name to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8925.179s">Is</a> the gesture nice? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8926.299s">Yes,</a> it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8927.04s">Is</a> the remembrance nice? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8928.12s">Yes,</a> it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8929.713s">of</a> having the remembrance for this young lady, yes, and for the three other folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8933.916s">But</a> I don't think it fits the budget right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8936.519s">I</a> don't like to be presumed and have my vote presumed on any dollar amount in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8943.304s">And</a> as a result of that, Mr. President, I'm going to make a recommendation that this dollar amount be reduced by 50%. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8949.829s">And</a> if they want to put something together, I think they can have enough monies to be put together <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8957.203s">to</a> make a very nice memorial at a $500,000 clip rather than, and I think the money's already there to make the $500,000 meet the obligation.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=8970.63s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9115.82s">Point</a> of clarification, Mr. President, clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9118.301s">Did</a> you just say that? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9119.79s">The</a> $75,000 for the water taxi is not part of the 475?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9157.128s">Just</a> to point that further, Mr. President, how could you, why would you want to spend that much time, effort, and energy on something that, I mean, if this is another project of the mayor's, I mean, it's taking away from other projects that the city needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9168.932s">And</a> this council isn't even aware of that one.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9197.721s">I'll</a> move to amend the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9198.862s">What?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9199.162s">I'll</a> move to amend the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9200.827s">To</a> amend the paper to 1.3.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9227.845s">It</a> doesn't make any difference, because I think as the rest of the dollars— We don't have to apply for the grant, because the rest of the dollars are there.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9242.054s">You</a> already have $350,000 from private people. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9243.515s">All</a> you have to come up with is another $100,000.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10234.056s">Councilor</a> Marks, did you just, I wrote it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10236.759s">Did</a> you say October 27 and then left a transcript? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10243.345s">There's</a> a picture of the mayor accepting a check for $299,000.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10267.271s">How</a> could you accept a check when the council hasn't even discussed it for a vote?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10275.732s">Two</a> weeks ago, Mr. President, you said we already voted on this and we didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10279.074s">So</a> you were proven wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10280.294s">You're</a> going to be proven wrong, too, because this council has never voted on this.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10289.32s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10296.084s">Not</a> for this vote.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10303.969s">Not</a> this vote, Paul.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10311.831s">I</a> was correct.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10312.832s">You</a> were wrong.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10351.274s">You</a> can't interrupt a roll call.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10367.058s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10368.178s">Motion</a> to table. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10369.539s">Oh,</a> no.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10371.419s">Why</a> should you guide him to tell him how to vote?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10412.933s">There's</a> more on the agenda.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10478.667s">Mr.</a> President, as we know, we had a committee of the whole meeting a little while ago with the Water and Soil Commission as it relates to the <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10486.104s">new</a> tiered water rate structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10487.545s">And</a> at that meeting, it was kind of like informative that there was some issues of concern that they were going to investigate as it relates to the tiers, whether it's tier one, two, and three. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10498.651s">The</a> one especially as it relates to tier two, which would be the rate set for the commercial business and the minimum of zero to 800 in tier one for the residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10509.797s">And</a> that's something to be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10511.998s">The</a> city council voted this past budget to knock out $600,000, <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10516.523s">from</a> the estimated amount that the MWRA would be having to impose on the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10523.127s">And</a> as a result of that vote, for which was eliminated from the budget, the Water and Soil Commission then implemented the tier rate system, which will, in essence, not only recapture the amount of money, but probably more than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10536.534s">My</a> concern right now is the mayor not addressing that for which the city council addressed during the budget and at that last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10545.538s">So</a> I went back into my inventory, which is January of 1989, and there's a front page headline that talks about water rates pushing up again, and the mayor is quoted. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10559.663s">I'm</a> going to read his quote on the increase in the water rates.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10565.125s">I</a> was in the sixth grade in 1989.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10568.406s">Should</a> have learned something then. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10570.207s">Bottom</a> line is, <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10572.461s">With</a> many residents getting water bills of between $400 and $600 for six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10577.223s">Remind</a> you, this is back in 1989. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10581.685s">$400</a> and $500 for six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10583.466s">The</a> increase could bring the annual cost of water bills for a family well over $1,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10589.008s">If</a> the city's passed along all of the increased costs, Mayor McGlynn issued a statement saying, I am challenging the state and federal officials to <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10600.018s">And</a> this is very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10601.098s">We're</a> going to go to page eight now. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10609.662s">And</a> this is the key part of the story. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10614.164s">The</a> federal governments have abdicated from their sense of responsibility to clean up the harbor. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10620.587s">Commenting</a> that the state and federal government fully expect us to pay an obscenely disproportionate share of the cleanup of these efforts, McGlynn called upon <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10630.287s">local</a> and state elected officials to provide support to legislate proposals that would take the funding off the local communities and to work to bring about administrative action to the same end. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10643.411s">And</a> that's nothing more than I think what this Council, myself, and other people have been saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10648.153s">We</a> didn't have a revenue reserve fund back then. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10651.754s">We</a> didn't have, no, $8.5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10654.795s">We</a> had all we could do to make sure that the people were paying these bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10657.737s">subsequent</a> to the enterprise fund coming under foundation. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10661.179s">And</a> here we have the mayor going back to 1989, back then, recognizing and addressing that the cost was not only going to be prohibitive, but cities and towns and the people who make up cities and towns are going to be paying for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10672.866s">And</a> here we have a chance, or here he has a chance right now, for the purposes of giving the break that he's talking about, that he was blaming the feds and the state for. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10682.352s">So</a> with that, Mr. President, this isn't me making it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10684.914s">This</a> is what he said. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10685.834s">These</a> are his quotes. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10687.099s">So</a> it's written in the paper in 1989. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10689.8s">In</a> 1989, as a matter of fact, we had a resolution on the council agenda on that same night to strip the MWRA of its powers because of obscene charging to cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10703.144s">I'm</a> asking, Mr. President, that my colleagues make a request to the mayor to hold in abeyance this tiered rate system for one year and to find out and to let's just see, you know, where we're going as it relates to the <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10717.571s">savings</a> in the water and soil count. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10719.132s">We</a> have $8.5 million, and now you're increasing the tax base even more for water and soil customers. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10725.598s">Totally</a> contrary to what the mayor argued way back in 1989, and at the same time, it's the same issue that's before us now, and we're sitting on $8.5 million of reserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10735.405s">We</a> had no reserves back then. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10737.187s">Now</a> we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10738.188s">And</a> again, to me, I think you're penalizing the ratepayers for this.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10785.094s">It's</a> not my article, it's what the mayor has said, and what the mayor was quoted as saying, not what I said. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10791.515s">Quoted</a> 30 years ago, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10792.696s">No,</a> this is 1989, not 30 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10793.656s">Yeah,</a> so what's wrong with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10799.037s">If</a> you saw the light back in 89, you had no reserve then and you got eight and a half million dollars now, why wouldn't you want to give it back to the rate payers?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10836.602s">Well,</a> then all I can say in response to that, Councilor, is simply this. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10839.465s">Back</a> in 1989, there was no dollar surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10842.027s">We</a> were fighting to stay survival. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10843.949s">And</a> from 89 until now, and while your friend the mayor has been in office, he's accumulated $8.5 million in surplus of tax and ratepayers' money, and he doesn't want to give it back to them, and he wants to keep charging them more and more.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10859.503s">We</a> asked for a tiered rate system. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10861.865s">We</a> didn't ask to have it imposed as they did. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10864.127s">We</a> asked, and I believe the whole idea was to show us what it would be like not to implement it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10872.856s">It's</a> the same thing with the parking meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10874.398s">You've</a> got parking meters all around the city.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10877.742s">Of</a> course it is.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10889.935s">What's</a> the story that history tells us?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10935.871s">What</a> a clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10937.332s">The</a> asking for a tiered rate system. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10939.353s">It's</a> true. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10939.974s">I</a> think we all asked for that because we wanted to know why we didn't ask to have it implemented. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10944.016s">I</a> think it was council max. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10948.118s">It</a> was the only one at the time that voted against the old, the new water rate, the new water meter system. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10953.9s">And</a> it was Councilor Marks who introduced the idea of having possibly a tiered rate system because of the commercial people in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10960.442s">And</a> those that use more water would be paying for more, and that's not what's happening.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11000.482s">And</a> that was the recommendation made at the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11002.504s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11004.545s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11183.046s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11186.767s">Automatically.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11188.207s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11188.528s">So</a> they are paying the high rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11189.848s">But</a> they're paying the second rate, the middle rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11191.388s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11191.548s">But</a> they're not paying the third rate, which is the highest of the rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11194.929s">That's</a> 1,800 and above, 1,600 and above. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11196.71s">If</a> they use it, they will. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11197.79s">If</a> they use it, they won't. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11201.231s">The</a> commercial, if you went to the meeting, you would have heard what he said. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11205.835s">Oh.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11226.603s">Read</a> the message that went out to the people.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11233.546s">How</a> do you know she's making macaroni?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11324.02s">The</a> taxpayers do.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11421.285s">The</a> reason why I brought this up is very simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11426.149s">Yeah,</a> it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11427.65s">History</a> tells you the story. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11428.891s">And</a> if the mayor back then recognized the fact that the people were getting walloped for having high water and sewer bills, how does it explain today when you have eight and a half million dollars and you can't give the people a break? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11441.362s">It's</a> as simple as that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11443.684s">Can't</a> have it both ways, as you say, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11447.806s">I</a> don't like cake, so you can eat it, all right?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11580.81s">You</a> just bring up, and you just, she just jogged my memory on something. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11584.014s">I</a> was told that you won't be able to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11586.116s">You'll</a> have to go online and make an application to get them. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11589.439s">If</a> that's the case, everybody doesn't have a computer in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11592.513s">So</a> if you don't have a car, how are you supposed to do this?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11597.476s">No,</a> I understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11598.137s">But</a> if they don't have a computer, and if they're telling you that's the only way you can do it online, that's. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11601.879s">I'm</a> sure there'll be other mechanisms.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_gvpawZbv1GQ/2025-03-21_gvpawZbv1GQ.html">Medford City Council - December 9, 2014</a></h2>

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2165.296s">So</a> then that got posted, what, in 2013? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2167.357s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2172.239s">On</a> the same train of thought, can we get, for the years 11, 12, and 13, <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2178.873s">Comcast</a> what they paid and what Verizon paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2181.274s">Do</a> you have that, Eddie? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2183.555s">11,</a> 12, and 13 fiscal years.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2195.56s">Now,</a> it looks like, and this is like, these numbers are really tight. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2199.522s">When</a> you talk about Medicaid reimbursement, you're talking about less than $60,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2208.55s">You</a> go from 446, 628 to 447.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2242.093s">And</a> also under 23, which is miscellaneous. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2245.515s">What</a> number? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2246.356s">Number</a> 23.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2253.081s">So</a> all our prior debt for last year's snowstorms and everything have been paid?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2259.185s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2261.887s">Can</a> we just go back? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2265.273s">Go</a> back to that number 10, where you have Comcast and Verizon, and you have fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2269.636s">We're</a> going to get them for 11, 12, and 13. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2271.277s">And</a> can you also give us the amount of money that was paid by the city of Medford to Channel 3 during those years, too? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2281.263s">Because</a> I believe they have all the checks.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2284.705s">Yeah,</a> to the Medford Community Cable Access.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2288.768s">No,</a> no, you're holding it, I believe, <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2291.139s">December</a> of 2012. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2292.04s">So</a> all of 11 and mostly all of 12, you wrote checks, the city wrote checks.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2301.968s">11</a> and 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2302.828s">Fiscal</a> 11 and 12, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2303.749s">And</a> then it stopped.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2306.672s">No,</a> we never got that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2307.852s">No,</a> you gave us how much is sitting in the account, but I want to know what was paid.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2312.616s">In</a> other words, during the month of 2011,
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2319.965s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2321.125s">You</a> have that, Eddie? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2322.426s">Yeah,</a> we got it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2497.068s">Also</a> on Locust Street, Lumineer, they should be coming on board too.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2506.453s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2506.934s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2507.554s">So</a> you get Lumineer, and then you're going to have the one at opposite station, standing where Mellon Bank is, and then you're going to have one further down in front of where the medical building is, and then, where's the fourth one? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2521.682s">River's</a> Edge, Middlesex Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2523.563s">No,</a> that's what I'm talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2524.423s">River's</a> Edge will have <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2526.285s">River's</a> edge. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2526.705s">We'll</a> have one. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2527.346s">And</a> then on the front in front of where Mellon bank is on the baseball field, there's another 230 units going to be in the back at one cab at road, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2534.069s">So</a> you can have two 30, three 30, four, you can have almost 550 more new units. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2539.131s">More</a> than that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2553.272s">We'll</a> see how long that lasts once the casino goes in, and what that does to the traffic, and to the Wellington area. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2562.56s">Mr.</a> President, I'd just like to get back and, are we gonna stay on that page, or are we going on another? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2572.068s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2574.109s">We'll</a> all wait until we get to the very end. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2575.811s">There</a> might be other issues, I don't know.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=3333.256s">One</a> further correction, I think Councilor Longo's current motion is basically for the years 11, 12, and 13, how much did that represent a surplus in those years of city's budgets? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=3343.179s">All</a> of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=3343.559s">The</a> free cash.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4022.883s">Two</a> points. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4023.564s">I</a> think this is your first time here?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4028.748s">You've</a> been here before? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4029.429s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4029.989s">Second,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4031.775s">This</a> council voted well over a year ago, and then again during this past summer on Terrace Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4036.819s">Two</a> light poles came down. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4040.082s">And</a> when National Grid went there, whoever they hired for contractor, what they did is they filled the holes and they never put the poles back up with the lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4047.428s">It's</a> a serious public safety issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4049.33s">The</a> council's on record on two separate times in voting for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4053.734s">National</a> Grid went up there, they marked the street, but they never put the poles back.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4059.218s">Terrace</a> Road.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4072.544s">This</a> has been brought to whoever runs the show over there in Malden numerous times, and they keep saying we're gonna get to it, and nobody's gotten to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4080.067s">There</a> are many folks that walk their children up and down the street in baby carriages and what have you, and that gets pretty dark at nighttime.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4093.092s">Two</a> poles.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4094.513s">Terrace</a> Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4096.334s">And</a> also, do you have any control over this 36% increase in the electric rate to bring back to your bosses? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4103.339s">I</a> wish I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4104.139s">You</a> got million dollar bonuses?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4107.902s">It's</a> a shame, because you know.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4114.286s">It's</a> just really unfair, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4116.427s">One</a> year, I mean, you people are conglomerate. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4118.349s">You've</a> got gas and electric. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4119.97s">So</a> I mean, we have no control over anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4122.09s">And</a> the poor ratepayers are going to pay another 27% to 36%. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4125.852s">And</a> as the story goes, and as it's been advertised, all your bonuses of a million dollars plus went to your higher executives. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4131.314s">And</a> I don't know how they can justify that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4133.075s">It's</a> just wrong.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4156.156s">No,</a> no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4156.416s">We</a> know the rates went up. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4157.617s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4157.937s">I</a> just think, I think if they're going to have the rates, I just think it's unfair that they would take million dollar bonuses in their contracts.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4986.95s">Just</a> one quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4988.55s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4989.591s">Councilor,</a> Alango brings up a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4992.612s">Even</a> though you're open, would you say to 1 o'clock?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4997.176s">We</a> have a situation on the parkway at Stations Landing, and because Kelly's Roast Beef is opposite the residential homes over there, she's right, they have to shut their sign down at 11 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5009.625s">That's</a> their big sign, not the sign that's on the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5013.328s">So</a> I'm assuming that Wendy sign right there on the red brick facade, that's your biggest sign? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5020.535s">No,</a> on the facade, the red.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5080.227s">As</a> long as those signs aren't facing the residential homes, correct?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5451.148s">Mr.</a> President, as an update to the proposed parking by Republic, which now appears like it's not going to take place until January of this forthcoming year, <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5463.535s">There</a> was something, and I have already responded to the chamber on this, there was something that was put out by the chamber basically talking about business parking implementation meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5474.106s">And</a> they sent a memo out to their members, and it basically is saying that the chamber at 1 Shipyard Way in room 302 will hold four <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5483.983s">meetings,</a> one for Hain Square, which is tomorrow night, one for the Medford Hillside in South Medford, which will be on Thursday, the 11th, and then next Wednesday, West Medford on the 17th, and then on the 18th, Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5497.406s">And</a> then it says, next week, and this was issued out this past Friday, a representative from Republic Parking will be visiting the business areas to distribute flyers regarding the meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5507.388s">Please</a> be sure to email or call the chamber to reserve a seat. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5511.149s">Seating</a> will be limited to 25 people, <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5513.839s">per</a> meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5515.08s">Well,</a> first of all, the Chamber of Commerce has nothing to do with Republic. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5519.844s">This</a> is a city of Medford undertaking, and this was the mayor's contract with Republic. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5525.549s">If</a> the Chamber of Commerce now be the linchpin, so to speak, between the city and Republic, I just don't think that's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5532.816s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5534.117s">Number</a> two, to walk around and pass out a flyer
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5557.188s">Well,</a> as a point of further information, and I think you're aware of it, not everybody in the chamber was for this and agreed to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5563.997s">So</a> let's be honest about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5565.398s">This</a> is a City of Medford undertaking, not a Chamber of Commerce undertaking, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5571.226s">Number</a> two, it's not an $18 million revenue enhancement for the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5575.953s">The</a> overall contract between expenditures and final payment to the city would be approximately $9 million at the end of the 10-year of the contract, not $18 million that everyone's touting and making people think that's what the city's going to get. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5589.705s">But</a> more importantly, if they were going to have these meetings and to identify the locations, number one, why would you squirrel 25 people into a room? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5598.619s">just</a> in case you've got an overflow of people, that's number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5601.681s">Number</a> two, why would you be having it at 5.30 at night when a lot of the business merchants, because I spoke to them, would rather have it early in the morning because at late at night they just can't pick up and leave, and the dock of night closes their shops down if they're single proprietors. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5614.269s">Number</a> two, and number three, and more importantly, and most importantly, if they're taking the time to walk to each one of these squares and pass out flyers, <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5621.633s">they</a> could have had enough time to find a location in each one of these four squares to accommodate them in their own particular district, so they'd be able to understand firsthand what they're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5631.8s">I</a> just don't think it's right, Mr. President and members of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5636.024s">The</a> chamber, they do a lot of wonderful things, but this is not their ballgame. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5639.586s">This</a> is the city of Medford's ballgame. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5641.047s">This</a> is the mayor's ballgame. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5642.248s">It's</a> his package with Republic. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5644.029s">They</a> should have figured this out. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5645.791s">The</a> chamber now would be the middleman. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5648.353s">Cutting</a> down whatever interferences for the mayor, I think it's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5651.736s">And</a> if this is Republic's way of doing it, they're going on the wrong foot. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5655.339s">And</a> more importantly, it would have been nice if the seven councils, if at least I, I'll speak for myself, got an invitation from Republic if we would like to participate, if you would like to be there, you have any questions or concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5668.289s">Once</a> again, the council's just excluded.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5685.392s">The</a> Chamber of Commerce is not Republic. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5688.233s">The</a> Chamber of Commerce is not the City of Medford and they don't profess to be the City of Medford or profess to represent the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5693.835s">The</a> Chamber of Commerce is nothing more than a liaison that Republic is using for the purpose of selling their particular program. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5701.017s">It's</a> not their program. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5702.318s">It's</a> the City of Medford's program. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5703.905s">It's</a> the taxpayers program, and they're the ones that are gonna have to take the brunt of what all this is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5708.747s">It</a> should be coming right here out of this city hall, out of this man, this is his program, and it should have been identified in all four sections of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5716.23s">Not</a> in the Chamber of Commerce, and not to squirrel 25 people into a room, just in case more than 25 decided to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5722.633s">What</a> are they gonna do, tell them that they can't come?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5733.965s">Well,</a> there in itself is the crux of the matter, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5737.109s">If</a> more than 25 come, why would you even wait to have more than 25 come? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5740.933s">Why</a> wouldn't you have found a spot ahead of time that can accommodate up to 100, every one of the four locations?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5749.562s">Well,</a> then the chamber, if they had any brains, they'd have been able to figure this out. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5753.005s">And</a> you're a member of the chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5754.065s">I'm</a> a member of the chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5754.786s">You</a> serve on the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5755.666s">You've</a> got a voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5756.247s">You</a> can speak up.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5764.933s">Councilor</a> De La Rosa, you're a member of the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5769.276s">I</a> just think...
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5780.718s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5781.018s">You</a> don't have to be dreadfully sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5782.799s">You</a> should just stand up and speak up and take a position and that's all. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5786.08s">And</a> the position is very clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5787.58s">If</a> you're a member of the chamber and you know that there are four sections of the city that are going to be affected, why would you want to put 25 people into a room and you had more than 25? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5795.222s">We'll</a> have to set the time for another time. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5797.363s">Why</a> would you just find the location and the area that they're going to be? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5800.305s">Point</a> of information.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5833.467s">I</a> disagree with you, Councilor.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5836.528s">It</a> might be a private entity, but it is not over and above. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5839.07s">This</a> is not the Chamber's issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5841.512s">This</a> is the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5842.913s">This</a> is the Mayor's position. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5844.394s">This</a> is the contract.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5850.127s">No,</a> it's neither of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5851.068s">It's</a> the idea that this is a City of Medford contract, is it not? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5855.21s">Is</a> it not a City of Medford contract, Councilor Dello Russo?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5859.953s">I'm</a> sorry things don't go the way you'd like them. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5862.214s">Well,</a> I'm sorry things don't go your way all the time as well, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5865.756s">And</a> maybe if you were more active, you'd have an understanding, and if you walk the streets, and you listen to the people... Councilor, enough of the cheap shots.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5876.982s">It</a> is. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5877.363s">It's</a> in your mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5878.024s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5878.384s">Well,</a> no, that's in your mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5879.686s">It</a> isn't in my mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5880.727s">I've</a> walked the streets and I talked to these business people and they would like to have had it in a particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5887.266s">Listen,</a> who's taking the cheap shot? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5888.648s">You</a> and me right now.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5893.132s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5894.994s">And</a> it goes both ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5895.935s">Well,</a> it's a private entity that's inviting them, not the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5897.918s">Well,</a> it's a private entity that's writing them. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5899.459s">But</a> unfortunately the private entity is doing business with the city as part of a public contract and public dollars are involved and it's just my, it's just my, Hey, listen. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5907.867s">It's</a> my opportunity, it's my personal opinion, and that's what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5910.469s">I'm</a> making my opinion, and Councilor De La Rosa doesn't like it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5913.011s">I'm</a> not going to apologize for him not liking it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5914.932s">He</a> doesn't like half the things I do, and I don't like half the things he does. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5917.914s">So</a> what difference does it make? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5919.235s">That's</a> our right, that's our freedom of speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5921.157s">That's</a> our way of saying what we want to say on a subject matter that means something, and this means something to me, because I hear the people talking. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5927.601s">And</a> now what are we going to do, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5929.963s">When</a> it snows out, we haven't even figured out who is going to plow the sidewalks where these meters are. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5935.027s">Is</a> it going to be the city's responsibility? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5937.048s">Is</a> it going to be republics? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5939.07s">And</a> what happens when a senior citizen or a handicapped person can't get to the meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5943.873s">These</a> are issues that need to be discussed and be brought out publicly to have a discussion on. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5949.077s">Still</a> not to have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5950.238s">And</a> they still haven't been able to identify the 932 parking spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5954.12s">That's</a> still up in the air. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5955.702s">So</a> what did we accomplish? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5956.983s">And</a> what has been accomplished by having republic come in when these haven't even been finalized?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5975.803s">I</a> just want to let the people know that this particular meeting, these particular meetings, I feel, <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5981.715s">should</a> have been in the four particular areas rather than in the chamber's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5985.097s">They</a> could have still been the sponsor, but they could have had places where more than 25 people could have come. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5990.181s">And</a> if they had it early in the morning rather than later at night, that's what the calls were that I got from people. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5996.625s">If</a> they were going to go, they would have prefaced being there. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6000.367s">I</a> would encourage you to put them all together in a room.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6011.639s">And</a> we had this conversation Sunday.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6017.261s">When</a> you say through the chamber, you're talking about the chamber, I'm talking about the business people. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6020.322s">There's</a> a lot of business people, Rick, that aren't chamber members.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6035.02s">Well,</a> they can't be there at 530 at night either, so what do they do?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6038.841s">Well,</a> I'm going to disagree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6040.301s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6241.976s">What</a> we're talking about, Mr. President, is everything that was discussed back in October. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6245.78s">October</a> 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6248.245s">as</a> reported, and it was a council meeting just prior to October 1st, where we had these discussions of having them come forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6255.107s">And</a> it was your comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6256.167s">It</a> was your comment at that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6258.268s">And</a> you said that this whole parking scenario is going to be a tough pill for the business people to swallow. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6263.47s">That's</a> what you said. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6264.85s">Well,</a> it's right here.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6268.831s">No,</a> he said it's a tough pill. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6269.992s">It's</a> going to be a tough pill to swallow. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6271.652s">That's</a> your quote. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6272.272s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6273.273s">It's</a> on the tape. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6274.053s">It's</a> on your quote. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6275.02s">And</a> with that being said, and recognizing then from October to now, from October to now, there's been nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6280.623s">And</a> a lot of the people in the business districts don't know who's gonna be getting these meters, who's not gonna be getting them.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6303.64s">Well,</a> maybe it would have been nice if the council was advised and maybe we had an opportunity to see what was going on rather than have to get an invite or hear something that the chamber's sponsoring. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6315.027s">And</a> if you want to tag along, you can come along.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6321.951s">This</a> is public health. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6322.551s">I</a> didn't say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6323.171s">Nobody</a> said that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6440.421s">John.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6443.402s">One</a> last thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6444.022s">I</a> think you forgot to mention and that whole commentary that you just talked about when channel seven came. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6449.103s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6450.083s">What</a> was the comment that the mayor made when they were asked him about the public park?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6460.266s">I</a> think he said, I think he said, John, <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6462.67s">that</a> the council did not put the money in the budget for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6465.491s">And</a> that's absolutely not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6467.352s">Which</a> is totally not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6468.893s">This</a> council each and every year has been supportive of them.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6832.526s">Mr.</a> President on page number two 12, <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6838.786s">under</a> resolution 14754, amendment number C. It's by amendment, it says amended by Councilor Panter and Councilor Longo-Curran, that OCD report back on what has information they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6854.315s">I</a> don't know what that means, it doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6859.518s">Well,</a> let's go to page, go page 12, 14754, number C. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6867.608s">And</a> then we go to, you got it? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6873.312s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6874.632s">I</a> don't know what the correction, I don't know what the term, the sentence doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6880.356s">No,</a> I'm telling you that needs to be corrected. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6886.52s">I'm</a> reading section C here, it doesn't make sense, the second line. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6889.882s">I</a> don't know what you have, and you have to go back to the tape and look at it, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6894.524s">You</a> take a look at it? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6896.005s">It</a> doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6897.417s">And</a> then we go to page 213, 14759, and under A, after the word but, that doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6914.943s">It</a> says, vended by myself of a street, if your street was not swept, but were tagged, ticket and towed, <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6922.449s">I</a> don't know if it's a resident or if it means your car. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6925.11s">I</a> don't know, I don't know what it's supposed to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6926.531s">You're</a> gonna have to go back and look at the tape.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6931.654s">Yeah,</a> but it doesn't say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6933.775s">It</a> says, if your street, if your street was not swept, but were tagged, ticketed, and towed, is it your car or a resident was tagged? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6945.341s">I</a> don't know, maybe it's a resident's car. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6947.723s">Maybe</a> those are the appropriate words that have to be put in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6950.264s">I</a> don't know what but were tagged means. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6952.793s">What's,</a> what's Eddie just, just go, just the sentence. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6958.935s">It</a> doesn't make sense to take a look at the tape and we can figure out exactly what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6965.737s">So</a> we're going to table those still. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6968.017s">No,</a> I have no problem as long as he corrects them. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6969.778s">That's</a> all. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6970.138s">It's</a> just, it's grammar, but it doesn't, it's not making any sense on the motion with further clarification of approval.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_gmU8To7cLAU/2025-03-21_gmU8To7cLAU.html">Medford City Council - December 2, 2014</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=206.602s">Councilor</a> Penta on the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=208.303s">Could</a> you explain to the people who might be watching, have no idea, location, hours of operation and what you intend to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=215.347s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=215.627s">Councilor.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=286.266s">Could</a> you, again, what's at the present location?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=316.216s">And</a> again, could you just repeat your hours of operation?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=319.679s">Hours</a> of operation again, one more time.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=323.583s">7</a> days a week? <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=324.063s">6</a> days. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=325.985s">6,</a> Monday through Friday.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=845.549s">Mr.</a> Viglione. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=849.311s">If</a> I understood what you said correctly from reading, what you're basically asking is for our city solicitor <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=854.486s">to</a> respond back or report back on this public records request. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=858.412s">And</a> if nobody responds to them, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=860.956s">At</a> least the council is apprised as compared to the solicitors still waiting. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=865.893s">to</a> get information, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=867.554s">Is</a> that what I understand?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=887.003s">If</a> I understand 501c3 correctly between the federal IRS and the Commonwealth of Mass, Department of Revenue, there are certain requirements <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=894.845s">that</a> are implicit in any one of these 501c3s. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=897.887s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=898.827s">And</a> there's requiring, there's time restrictions, a regulation basically talking about who the corporate officers might be, if any change of offices, elections, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=907.793s">Some</a> of them are on an annual basis, and some of them are just when needs to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=911.835s">The</a> part that I, Councilor Caraviello, the part that I think is a little perplexing here, when you say that, you know, parents have been involved for a long period of time, and maybe a long period of time they knew something was going on, they did nothing about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=925.603s">Shame</a> on them for allowing that to happen, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=928.624s">And</a> there's no one to blame on that situation except them. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=932.645s">Even</a> if they had an iota, that something might smell wrong, they should have done that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=942.168s">Been</a> asking is one thing and acting is another, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=944.869s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=945.489s">Number</a> two, just making a quick reflection back on cable television and Channel 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=953.171s">The</a> difference here, if I understand you correctly, Joe, is the West Medford Little League is not the same as Medford Community Access Television. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=961.997s">The</a> city has a direct person on community access. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=967.141s">It's</a> the mayor's appointment, as a matter of fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=968.902s">And</a> having the mayor's appointment and not getting the information that is supposed to be given and retrieved, and not on an annual basis, there is something wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=976.447s">And</a> I think it's as clearly defined with Judge Jackson's report that she wrote in <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=980.289s">I</a> believe it was December of 2011 or 12 or whatever it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=984.913s">2009,</a> excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=985.834s">But</a> with that, I've got no problem making this request. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=989.056s">And</a> I don't think Mr. Remley will have any problem responding to it, too, because if he gets no response, that just puts more fodder into the argument with the AG and the Secretary of State's office that not only is our city solicitor waiting for information who's played somewhat of a role. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1006.15s">I</a> don't know how deep we can say a role is because, unfortunately, he doesn't have the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1010.187s">now</a> to go forward and continue on what he needs to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1013.89s">But</a> there is definitely something wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1016.171s">When</a> you have a tax-exempt nonprofit sitting on, or the city sitting on, it's over $303,000 in the city's coffers downstairs right now, if not more. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1026.858s">And</a> knowing that by, I think it's April 30th, a new contract has to come forward as it relates to Comcast, Verizon is still ongoing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1034.883s">The</a> fact of the matter is this, that there is a time sequence. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1037.526s">that</a> a public hearing needs to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1039.047s">And</a> we've got no notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1040.767s">Ratepayers</a> have received no notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1042.348s">Nobody's</a> received any notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1044.069s">And</a> neither has the mayor responded to our request when and if the public hearing is going to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1049.151s">So</a> I see the analogy that you're trying to draw. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1052.552s">It's</a> a shame that it took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1053.693s">But</a> you're right, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1055.453s">The</a> parents on this one here in the West Medford community, in the West Medford Little League, the onus was on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1060.775s">If</a> they had an idea that something was wrong, they should have pursued it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1063.437s">And</a> they didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1064.457s">Thankfully,</a> it got caught up to the people who were the perpetrators. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1068.14s">Channel</a> 3, an entirely different story. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1070.341s">I</a> think that just escalates the situation right into the corner office. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1073.782s">It's</a> his responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1075.223s">He</a> knew what was going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1076.523s">We've</a> asked for information. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1077.844s">It</a> hasn't come forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1079.004s">The</a> proper documentation has yet to be filed, to the best of my knowledge, with the AG's Office of the Secretary of State, maybe partially, not totally. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1086.747s">And</a> for the sake of having any kind of an argument, Channel 3 could still be legitimately an operating functional business here in the city of Medford, because they're alleging that they filed disillusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1098.375s">has</a> never been accepted and recorded and duly noted. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1100.577s">And</a> if I remember correctly, I believe it was Candidate Coakley, who lives in Medford, who at some point in time, I think it was January of last year, indicated that she was going to look into this cable access and the public access area in the city of Medford because it's huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1118.752s">It's</a> a big thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1120.633s">And</a> I'm just going to detour real quick, Mr. President, on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1124.016s">It'll</a> come up under my suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1126.423s">But</a> I have spoken to so many people since this Thanksgiving Day football game that are so upset that they couldn't watch it on their local access that they've had for years, as other cities and towns have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1137.812s">One</a> lady went out of her way, and she made a remark as it relates to one of the candidates running for governor, who happens to come from Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1145.758s">I</a> won't mention the name. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1147.38s">Totally</a> disappointed that that individual did not pursue the fact that public access was not made available, not only for her, but every other candidate running. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1156.235s">And</a> with that being said, there's a true concern here about not only money being misspent and misappropriated, but money being held in abeyance and no action taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1167.141s">And</a> it just continues to go on. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1169.623s">And</a> unfortunately, ratepayers, each and every month when you get your bill, you're going to see the money that's going to be going there for public access TV. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1175.746s">There's</a> no public access TV. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1176.927s">I</a> don't know what it's going to take to cause a storm. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1180.229s">Same</a> thing with your water bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1181.63s">It</a> just keeps going up and up and up, and nobody says nothing about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1184.733s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I have no problem moving this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1187.715s">I</a> don't think the city solicitor has any problem accepting it because if in fact he gets no response back as duly requested, at least we'll know and we'll all be on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1196.48s">And</a> at least I think we can take the next step to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1198.621s">That's</a> how I'm viewing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1199.502s">I</a> could be wrong, but that's the way I'm looking at it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1699.012s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1699.813s">One</a> quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1700.793s">The</a> settlement is just for property damage, if I understand this correctly.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1705.053s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1705.373s">Was</a> there any damage to the firetruck? <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1707.495s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1959.647s">On</a> that motion, you jogged my memory. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1961.408s">It</a> goes back some years ago when former Councilor Mayorko introduced a resolution similar to that on buses, advertising for buses in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1970.751s">I</a> think the city generated something like 30, $35,000 a year by doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1975.593s">So</a> maybe the advertising of outside vendors on that as a particular part of repurposing can bring in a few dollars, whatever it might be worth. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=1983.776s">And</a> at the same time, you've accomplished two things.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2120.798s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2121.658s">Mr.</a> President, this past Thursday, it was absolutely fabulous to see our Medford youngsters not only win, but win in a huge fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2131.421s">I've</a> been attending these games for the last, <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2134.006s">56</a> years. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2134.667s">I</a> only missed twice, and I believe both of them were called off because of inclement weather. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2139.51s">And</a> as a result of that, I think I can speak with some sense of knowledge as it relates to what takes place during these particular games. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2148.616s">These</a> boys absolutely went out of their game. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2151.618s">And</a> as their coach, Jason Nascimento, indicated, I think they played over and beyond that for which anybody expected in this day. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2160.824s">It's</a> the second oldest rivalry in the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2163.247s">Latin</a> and English is the oldest one, and Malden and Medford is the second one. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2167.008s">And,</a> you know, I think it's a true testament to the fellas and the coaches that they prepared the kids for the game, and they played with a tremendous amount of excitement. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2177.09s">But</a> something took place at that game that jogged my mind, and it's a disturbing fact, and I think it goes like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2184.312s">When</a> first attending the game, I noticed the field. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2186.392s">The</a> field was not at all cleared. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2188.953s">The</a> snow was on the field. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2191.104s">And</a> with the snow being on the field, my first thought was, wow, these kids are going to play on this field. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2195.546s">You</a> know, anybody could get hurt at any time, either side, Mauldin or Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2199.848s">And</a> when I was watching the news at the end of the day, recapping all the local games and all the local teams that took place, every one of the games that they did and they showed on TV, the recaps, the snow was all put to the side or to the ends of the end zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2212.274s">And</a> these kids were playing on a decent field. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2214.835s">It</a> may not have been the best field, but at least the snow was cleared off of the field. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2219.805s">And</a> then I want to thank a fellow by the name of Michael Nestor, because he brought to my attention something that he found written in the local press and in the Boston press. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2228.475s">It</a> talks about the Malden coach. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2230.457s">The</a> coach's name was Joe Papagallo. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2232.659s">And</a> he said, I feel in my heart of hearts, if I had a regular playing field that we could have played on, our regular game, we would have come out on top. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2244.25s">What</a> is he saying? <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2245.131s">The</a> game was in Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2247.072s">It's</a> your home turf. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2249.314s">It</a> was your place to make sure that the field was cleared out through the superintendent or your director of operations, whoever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2257.76s">And</a> then to add further insult to injury, our Metfed marching band was not allowed to go on the field because Malden did not have a band. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2267.821s">So</a> the kids that prepared all for the period of time for the Medford-Malden game were not given the privilege to go out in that field and do their halftime show. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2278.586s">What</a> do they have for a halftime show? <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2281.347s">Someone</a> throwing Frisbees into the net. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2285.369s">That</a> was a complete insult to the people who were there, both Medford and Malden, but whoever put this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2291.692s">And</a> I don't know where the principal of our school at Medford High or the principal, Mr. Brown, <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2297.379s">at</a> the Malden School was on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2300.183s">But</a> it's just impossible. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2301.626s">Spoke</a> to many parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2303.549s">Spoke</a> to school committee personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2305.938s">They</a> just don't understand how and why this could have happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2308.719s">We</a> were the guest team. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2309.859s">We</a> weren't the home field. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2311.48s">And</a> to insult the guest team by saying, your band, we're asking your band not to go on there because we don't have a band to go on there, and then to put a Frisbee thing out there at midterm, at midfield, I mean at halftime, excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2325.424s">Just</a> complete, total insult. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2328.445s">But</a> the best part of the whole day is that Medved won 36 to 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2333.847s">They</a> not only beat them, <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2335.537s">they</a> proved their point, that they don't need a field in good condition because, quote, he indicated that his fellas, the Malden coach says that his fellas on the team couldn't get their traction, their grip on the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2352.986s">Well,</a> what made the difference between Malden and Medford being able to do it? <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2357.109s">But</a> more important, the bottom line to all of this is a public safety issue of the kids playing on that particular field. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2364.286s">There</a> was no other field that was shown on television on that day on highlights that talked about teams playing on a frozen field. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2372.294s">They</a> had plenty of time to go out there and clear off that field. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2375.397s">And</a> if they had to delay the game to do it, they should have done it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2378.701s">But</a> they didn't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2380.002s">And</a> then to add insult to injury, to have the coach turn around and say, if I had a regular field, <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2387.573s">that</a> we could have had a regular game and they would have come out on top. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2391.316s">Then</a> at the end, he throws a kudo, but the Medford kids did a good job and they won. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2395.84s">That's</a> BS in plain English. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2398.582s">Both</a> sides, both kids go there to play a game on that particular day. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2402.425s">Win,</a> lose, or draw, because that's what sports are supposed to be all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2405.367s">But</a> it didn't turn out to be that way because of one coach's remarks, which were quite inflammatory as far as I'm concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2411.711s">And</a> then to add insult to injury, to have our Medford High School marching band not be allowed to go out there because Malden didn't have one, that's an insult. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2420.813s">That's</a> an insult to the whole program. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2422.914s">And</a> you talk about a program, if you went there, they passed you out a program. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2427.115s">Every</a> program had Medford and Malden in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2429.116s">This</a> year, they only had the Malden players. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2431.136s">Medford</a> players were not found on the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2434.277s">So</a> I don't know who put this whole thing together. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2436.457s">It's</a> obvious it came on the Malden side. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2439.197s">But</a> their superintendent, their principal of the high school, their coach, and whoever takes care of their grounds should all be held accountable and be told it's a shame that they allowed that game to be played with all the conditions that are surrounding it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2453.722s">But</a> the highlight of the game was the fact that Medford won, and they won convincingly. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2458.884s">And</a> they should be so proud under the conditions that took place, not only did they won, <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2464.263s">I'm</a> so proud of them for taking a picture with their band people after the game to let people know that they appreciated the fact that the band was just as much a part of the Medford-Malden game as anybody else. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2475.276s">Mr.</a> President, I've seen a lot of games, I've been to a lot of games, but this is the first that I've ever seen come out like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2482.203s">and</a> the stupidity, and I'll call it that, of going out there and tossing Frisbees into a net for a halftime show is the most insulting thing you can do when you have a band ready, willing, and able to play. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2493.369s">It</a> didn't make any sense.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2500.974s">It</a> is. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2501.714s">And</a> I also want to, again, I want to thank Mr. Nesta for bringing this <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2506.43s">to</a> the attention to a lot of people, it highlighted, and then upon reading it and seeing it and reviewing other comments from other people, you know, it's interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2514.017s">You</a> know, I believe it was 1992 or 1994, yeah, because I think the announcement was 20 years on that day. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2522.029s">Medford</a> beat Malden six to nothing, and he was the only one that scored the touchdown on that day for Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2526.152s">Yeah,</a> he still breaks my chucks, because I get the offensive player of the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2528.874s">That's</a> beside the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2530.495s">I'm</a> glad somebody does. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2531.555s">But</a> that's beside the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2533.016s">The</a> fact of the matter is simply this. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2535.578s">Medford</a> played an outstanding game. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2537.78s">And</a> as their senior quarterback said, it'll be the greatest thrill. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2541.362s">It's</a> been a long time coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2543.043s">And</a> it was a great day for the citizens and the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2547.546s">And</a> shame on Malden for doing what they did. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2551.003s">but</a> congratulations with high honors and high praise. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2554.024s">Mr.</a> President, I'd like to have the Method High football team come and appear before the city council so they could duly receive an award for their outstanding victory in that particular day because it was, they just did things that were totally spectacular and the coach as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2570.348s">The</a> what?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2581.758s">Mr.</a> President, there are a couple of, I don't want to hold up all the records, but there's a couple of typos in there and I think, I think that's, yeah, yeah, just, I can either that or correct it, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2593.545s">Hang</a> on one second.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2616.457s">Mr.</a> President, we got a copy tonight here of a, um, of a notice of a public meeting that's going to take place next Wednesday evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2626.302s">I</a> believe it's six 30. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2627.242s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2631.856s">Well,</a> anyway, checking into it further, oh, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2634.497s">Checking</a> into this thing further, it talks about the reason why MassDOT, the reason, and it's not explained, I have no idea why it's not explained. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2642.042s">The</a> reason why MassDOT is having this is because of a federal, there is a federal inclusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2646.924s">Because</a> of the money I believe that the city is applying for under the, with the waterway taxi that the mayor has under consideration, I believe 200 and somewhat thousand of that 475, <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2659.0s">is</a> particularly earmarked for this particular location. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2661.721s">And</a> because of that earmark, the MassDOT, or the State Department of Transportation, has to call the hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2668.565s">But</a> in essence, it's really as it relates to explaining the whole idea as it relates to the federal money being used for this particular project. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2676.729s">The</a> right of way, it's just language, from what I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2680.191s">It's</a> just language that's thrown in there if, in fact, temporary or permanent easements are needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2685.814s">I</a> believe that the easements that are needed <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2688.015s">One</a> of them already exists. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2688.955s">And</a> I think it's just a reaffirming it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2690.656s">And</a> that's the walkway that's between the senior center and the, and the, um, and the one 21 Riverside Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2697.697s">And</a> then there's another one that allows for a, for an easement coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2701.238s">Um,</a> so with that being said, Mr. President, I would like to, um, and I think it should have been clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2706.159s">I,</a> is this Mr. Clark, a notification of a public hearing? <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2710.56s">Is</a> this the document that went out? <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2714.937s">notice</a> of a public hearing that they sent out for, for who is it for? <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2718.278s">It's</a> just it's a DOT department of transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2720.839s">It's</a> being held here in the council chamber for the, for the peace hosted by Frank DiPaolo. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2725.802s">We</a> got that from a ministry. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2727.542s">Could</a> we have, um, could we have, um, either from the chief engineer or the administrator and upgrading, um, an upgraded letter as to, because it's confusing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2737.726s">It</a> isn't really DOT. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2738.887s">It's</a> the feds that are going through the state department of transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2742.308s">That's</a> the reason why this hearing is being called. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2744.371s">So</a> could we have an explanation either from Lauren's office, DeLorenzo, or?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2751.235s">Who</a> do you want to ask?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2840.134s">I</a> believe, Mr. President, this is something new that OCD meeting is going to be setting an agenda as it relates to community development, as it relates to certain portions of the community development block grant hearing.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2863.365s">Well,</a> there's another one then that's scheduled as it relates to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2866.227s">I</a> think it's a preliminary meeting as it relates to setting an agenda that's going to handle the fiscal.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2892.812s">If</a> it's, if there was a park grant notice that went out a little while ago, is this, is this the park grant where the mayor, um, Lauren de Lorenzo, and I forget who the third person was, took a picture saying that the city is going forward and voted for this money for a park grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2911.307s">And</a> this never came before the city council and the law and the law requires the city council to take a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2916.391s">And</a> how can the mayor, <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2917.64s">Go</a> forward.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2941.65s">Some</a> of those monies, I'm going to beg you to differ with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2944.271s">Some</a> of those monies were used.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2952.223s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2952.883s">Then</a> we're talking about two separate issues if that's the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2954.924s">And</a> the issue that I'm talking about is the one where the mayor took a picture and after speaking with the lady in Boston who was in charge of the program, the only reason that the city is not getting its portion of the money, they do not have yet a recorded roll call vote from the city.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=3079.094s">referring</a> to residential exemptions, whether it's 15, 20, 25, 30%, whatever it might be.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=3084.437s">And</a> he also brought down the number of homes that would be affected and what the dollar range was. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=3090.14s">So</a> if he could do that, that would be great.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=3118.04s">I</a> know, I think this is, I have an idea where she's going. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=3120.481s">If</a> it's 10, 15, 20, 25, 30%, and then how does that reflect upon 2.5, 2% or whatever it might be?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=3130.426s">How</a> does that affect not hitting the max of 2.5?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=3148.854s">As</a> far as the real estate values go, that's an unfair comment to make, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=3155.895s">No,</a> no, I understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=3157.575s">But</a> real estate values have jumped dramatically in this city.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=3162.396s">That's</a> what I'm referring to. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=3163.237s">No,</a> but folks in this community, <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=3166.282s">It's</a> either the fifth or the sixth hottest market in real estate for people living in the city or selling real estate. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=3173.186s">I</a> don't know about living here, but selling it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=3175.447s">And</a> with that being said, I think the breakdown that the Councilor Lungelkern is alluding to, it makes a lot of sense because I think we're threading pretty close to now getting to an exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=3184.632s">Somerville</a> just had theirs up to 35% for residential tax exemptions. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=3189.608s">They</a> have it all broken down, and as it relates to business, new business, two, a single, double, and a triple family home, and they're doing pretty well. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=3197.834s">And</a> look at the development that they have over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=3200.656s">Another</a> thing, Mr. President, I'd like to add an amendment to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=3204.639s">How</a> much? <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=3206.42s">Mr.</a> President, I'd like to add an amendment, an addendum to Councilor Lengelkern's thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=3211.544s">I'd</a> like to know the new revenue that was brought in taxes last year as compared to the new revenue brought into taxes this year.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=3220.835s">New</a> revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=3221.375s">New</a> tax revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=3222.075s">New</a> tax revenue? <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=3222.675s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=3222.815s">Because</a> that speaks volumes as to ongoing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=3228.718s">If</a> we, for example, took in a million dollars last year and this year it's projected to go out another $2 million or a million dollars again, that's $2 million extra in each year in the coffers. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=3239.542s">And</a> once again, the ratepayers aren't seeing that.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_UuOesa_m9wQ/2025-03-21_UuOesa_m9wQ.html">Medford City Council - November 25, 2014</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=59.183s">Mr.</a> President, members who might be watching, and I understand I see out there there are members of the Bicycle Commission here, and I'm glad that they're here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=67.47s">I</a> received quite a few emails from interested people, I believe members of your commission as well, as it relates to this particular issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=75.536s">Last</a> week when this was presented to us as part of the million dollar plus wish list of the mayor of Medford, and this issue had been brought up, I believe your chairperson, Mr. Kulik, was here. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=87.013s">And</a> there was some remarks made as it related to where we would be going with this $25,000 money that's going to be earmarked for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=95.855s">Um,</a> I'm also glad I see the chief of police in the audience too, because there's a request to you to attend to one of their meetings as it relates to bicycle safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=105.657s">And</a> I see you nodding your head. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=106.737s">So</a> we're just going to work on the date. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=108.458s">The</a> bottom line to all of this is basically the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=111.078s">Um,</a> I received phone calls subsequent to last Tuesday's meeting as it relates to <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=115.849s">Where</a> exactly are these bike lanes going to go? <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=120.171s">In</a> front of what homes in the residential areas? <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=123.433s">There</a> was a concern in some of your emails that you folks sent back and forth yesterday and today, over the weekend too, I suppose. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=131.436s">You</a> talked about Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=132.737s">Some</a> people wanted, some people didn't want Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=135.458s">Streets</a> that had a high visibility of traffic and use of traffic, which might either interfere with the public safety or impede public safety as it relates to bicycles. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=144.915s">So</a> this is actually wanting to get a clear definition of what exact streets these bicycle lanes are going to be proposed for. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=154.801s">And</a> by numerical number, business or residential, where would they be located? <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=162.185s">And</a> I believe an explanation coming forward as it relates to if in fact a bicycle lane is going to be in front of either a business or a residential home, <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=173.965s">Does</a> that precede anyone having the ability to park there, as they presently do, or not to park there, or whatever it might be? <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=181.806s">We</a> all know that bicycles are here to stay. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=183.847s">It's</a> the advent of the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=185.927s">Somerville</a> has done a great job in moving this issue forward, so has the city of Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=191.808s">Medford's</a> a little bit behind the times, but finally they're catching up. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=195.909s">And</a> we have to recognize the fact that bikes are here, and bike lanes are here, and they are needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=201.19s">But</a> I just think it's having a program <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=203.501s">that's</a> identified, specified, location-wise. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=208.005s">And</a> the other part of the concern was when a bicycle lane comes to an end and it finds itself either back out into the main thoroughfare or what have you, what's an explanation just are and what is the right-of-way privileges that a biker would have as compared to a motorist driving in the same lane? <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=233.005s">So</a> with that being said, I don't know who really can answer it other than I believe whoever is going to make this determination, where the locations are going to be, where the business locations are going to be and the other questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=247.337s">I</a> know the bicycle commission, you folks, you know, you're new at it and it's, I guess you're trying to identify all of these things, but I don't know who's going to make this determination in the city as to how it's going to be implemented. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=262.528s">for</a> the Sharos, the $25,000, its locations, and bicycle safety, because that would be the major concern that I would have, that the bicyclists with your roadways or on your roadways, you know, are protected via public safety, but at the same time, if they're going to be at specific locations, just how are they going to be managed and who is going to manage them? <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=286.116s">So</a> that is the resolution, Mr. President, and I would like to forward that back <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=290.47s">to</a> the city administration with those questions to be answered.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=296.935s">Roll</a> call vote, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=470.935s">Um,</a> I just noticed that on my desk, Mr. President, um, an amendment to this, um, resolution that's being offered here by the, uh, bicycle advisory commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=482.604s">And,</a> um, I appreciate the fact that you folks, I'm just getting it right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=487.027s">I</a> just, <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=487.852s">seeing</a> it on my desk. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=488.692s">So</a> if other people go out earlier than that, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=491.694s">I'm</a> just seeing it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=492.994s">But,</a> um, part of the, um, part of the issue that's being presented, um, does indicate certain locations, but it doesn't give street addresses. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=500.818s">And</a> I think that's important to know if we could put street addresses on here that identify where on the particular roadways, for example, when you say place that road from Winthrop street to West Bedford square, bike lanes, the sharrows, depending upon measured road width. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=514.044s">Um,</a> I, I'm also getting the idea that, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=518.26s">This</a> $25,000, it's inclusive for what you want to do with the bicycles. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=522.363s">This</a> is a proposal, is that what you're saying? <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=525.805s">And</a> if this has to be approved by the Traffic Commission, as Councilor Knight has alluded to, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=534.149s">I</a> really don't know if the Traffic Commission has other ideas where the bike lanes want to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=540.253s">I</a> mean, is it your call? <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=542.174s">I</a> mean, explain this to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=544.135s">Maybe</a> you can come up here and explain this because this is all new to me and I just want to make sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=548.18s">what</a> gets presented before the traffic commission is as accurate as can be for them to vote on.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=598.225s">What</a> was the question you asked? <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=600.667s">The</a> question on number one, I just got this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=602.689s">I</a> found it on my desk. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=603.909s">So</a> I did not have this over the weekend or this morning to review it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=607.452s">So</a> this is last minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=609.552s">being</a> presented here.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=612.914s">Well,</a> I'm just telling you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=614.175s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=615.056s">Um,</a> that's number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=615.896s">Number</a> two, um, you, you, you're making proposals here, like you say, from Winthrop street, uh, from Winchester lane line to approximately Wildwood road bike lanes on each side, um, by taking bike roads, for example, on either side of Winthrop street, that's going to shrink the side of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=634.709s">That's</a> going to shrink the width of the street for vehicular traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=638.685s">And</a> I'm just wondering, once again, something like that, when the traffic commission sees that, is that going to be something that's going to be acceptable to them? <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=646.791s">Because</a> to some degree, having bike lanes on one side of the street is not the same as having it on two sides of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=652.876s">For</a> example, if you are leaving Ball Square and going to Powder House Square, their bike lane is on the right-hand side of the street, not on the left-hand side of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=661.143s">But</a> that's not the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=663.425s">The</a> issue is simply this. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=664.826s">You've</a> given five indications here, where you would like to put it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=668.277s">Um,</a> I think it would be more appropriate or better for you folks when you submit this, uh, for the request to the traffic commission that you identify the street addresses, uh, beginning and ending. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=679.123s">And</a> second of all, um, where these bike lanes and, and they converge back up to the main street. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=685.647s">Um,</a> I'd like to know how that's going to take place, how it's going to get done. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=689.91s">I</a> just, I guess I can't see it in my mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=693.192s">You're</a> in a bike lane and all of a sudden the bike lane ends. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=695.81s">Where</a> does the bike go back up to the street?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=808.428s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=809.908s">Bruce,</a> whoop. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=811.129s">I</a> was gonna put you back on the seat. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=815.111s">As</a> we discussed at the last meeting that you had, bicyclists are also supposed to observe the rules of the road as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=820.594s">Handed</a> notifications, clothing, lighting,
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=850.301s">Now</a> you also, Bruce, at the very last page, I just noticed you say final recommendations will be made after we had a chance to review the actual site conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=859.067s">So</a> am I understanding that your commission hasn't reviewed all of this yet by site?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=866.932s">So</a> these are nothing...
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=883.086s">So</a> it's possible that some of these locations can change.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=888.148s">Well,</a> if the, um, I don't know if the news media is here or not, but I would suggest that before, um, these five locations that you've identified, <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=898.293s">are</a> put out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=899.173s">These</a> are subject to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=900.194s">They</a> could be added to or subtracted. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=902.255s">And</a> I think that's what the concern is. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=904.436s">You</a> know, where are they going to go, and do they follow the issues that I presented you before? <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=909.158s">So,</a> Mr. Clark, Mr. Clark, on this particular paper, I'd like to have it referred to Mr. Kulik and his commission, but more importantly, I guess, to the Traffic Commission, that if, in fact, no matter what they recommend, whether it's these five locations or anything more added or subtracted, <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=928.207s">that</a> they give the actual addresses inclusive of where they begin, where they end. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=932.871s">So</a> as anybody in these particular locations are perfectly aware of where the bike lanes go, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=939.096s">And</a> number two, does a bike lane supersede someone's availability to park on the street? <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=944.801s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=945.481s">I</a> can't answer that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=947.082s">I</a> don't know.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1224.767s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1225.307s">I</a> appreciate it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1227.708s">Bruce,</a> don't go. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1229.169s">We</a> talked about Bice Racks. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1230.089s">I</a> think it was two or three years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1231.35s">It</a> could be even longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1232.83s">The</a> city got some kind of a grant for bike racks. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1235.371s">And</a> one of the bike racks they put up there is in the 1th Street parking lot, which is half owned by the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1240.566s">And</a> I forget what the second one was. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1242.267s">So</a> you may want to check in with, it could have come out of OCD. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1245.53s">It</a> could come out of one of those state grants.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1258.619s">So</a> maybe you can go back and look into that type of a grant if the city's never reapplied for it or whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1263.683s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1265.404s">That's</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1265.905s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1282.814s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1283.194s">But</a> these are just proposals. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1284.995s">These</a> five, whether they're going to add or subtract because as Bruce indicated, uh, these are just recommendations at the present time. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1291.058s">So</a> that would be number one as to what they do recommend the, uh, the exact street address by location. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1299.042s">And</a> second of all, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1300.948s">I</a> just don't know if they're in a legitimate spot where somebody can park in front of their business or their home and a parking lane is going to go there. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1309.575s">There's</a> a, who has chief you're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1312.217s">Can</a> you answer that?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1391.915s">The</a> question chief is if, if you are putting a bike lane in front of my house, so my business that I have, I have a right to park there, legitimate right to park there. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1402.665s">Are</a> you telling me now, if a bike lane goes there, I cannot park there anymore.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1443.335s">And</a> that's, that's the key to, that's the key to my issue here. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1446.396s">I</a> don't know where these five recommendations are right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1450.737s">And</a> I don't know if any of these find themselves in front of anyone's home. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1454.558s">Let's</a> just say, and if that'd be the case, if people have been allowed in the past up until now to park in front of the house without any violation and a bike lane goes in there, I mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1464.855s">I</a> don't want to get into a contest over this, you know, you know, that the bike lane should supersede the residential owner, because that's going to be the issue that we're going to be hearing from residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1472.318s">You're</a> putting a bike lane in front of my house, but I can park there and I parked there. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1476.02s">I've</a> been able to park there for years.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1523.466s">You,</a> for example, one of the recommendations here says placed at road from Winthrop street to West Medford square. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1528.989s">It</a> doesn't say right or left. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1530.129s">It</a> just says placed at road. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1532.57s">So</a> right now in place that road folks can park in front of their house. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1537.813s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1538.598s">If</a> a bike lane goes there, are you telling the residents in that area that they can't park in front of the house?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1581.972s">And</a> this is the concerns that I've received from folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1586.174s">Some</a> people don't even have these five locations and they just want to know, is the city going to have bike lanes all over the place? <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1591.958s">And</a> these are some of the issues and that's just, <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1593.743s">That's,</a> you know, we've got to discuss it before it becomes a finale.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2589.96s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2590.981s">If</a> I understood council Marks correctly, the city of Medford was informed about this.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2625.811s">when</a> the mayor chooses not to attend or he can't attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2628.873s">But</a> you indicated that there are 17 single family cottages, nine of which are in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2635.938s">How</a> can a proposed development take pieces of property in Medford and use it as part of their development and another city and have our city in return and not be there to even discuss and protect it or even have an awareness of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2648.307s">And</a> I just think this is a something went wrong in the communication issue here, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2653.131s">And</a> you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2654.09s">I</a> remember the neighbors many, many years back had this issue when the hospital was operating, if I remember correctly, and the cut-through was going through there. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2662.475s">And</a> then I think, Chief, you were there, and they had to put a stop to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2666.198s">And</a> how they put a stop to it was only allowing, by a case of emergency, for a fire truck to go through. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2670.981s">That</a> was it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2672.141s">And</a> then for some reason, the hospital closed down in 1999, and everything ended. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2676.744s">And</a> now, with this type of a development, which is 399 units, or 399 potential units, <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2683.451s">nine</a> of the 17 of these units are going to be in the city of Medford and we weren't even aware of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2688.352s">We</a> as a council weren't even notified of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2690.893s">Even</a> if we wanted to attend, we didn't have that opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2694.374s">And</a> if the city, in fact, um, Mr. President, if the city in fact was notified and they sent nobody there, a shame on them because that's, that's embarrassing. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2701.435s">I</a> think to the residents who live in that neighborhood should be represented by city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2706.917s">Um,</a> I, I would like to just bump up one more part of your resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2711.298s">I</a> think the offscreen development, <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2713.149s">needs</a> to report back to the city of Medford, to the council, just exactly what is the city's position on this development? <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2719.332s">Since</a> in fact, Medford pieces of property are part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2723.435s">We're</a> not a party. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2724.675s">We're</a> not a partner to this development. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2726.737s">It</a> just, these pieces of property are part of the development. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2729.678s">If</a> I understand you correctly, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2732.36s">And</a> that's what you were told that night at the hearing, at the public meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2737.623s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2738.623s">So</a> maybe we should all get a copy of what was being proposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2743.082s">cat's</a> out of the bag of the bond right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2744.803s">So,</a> uh, you know, nobody from the city was there to even get information. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2748.707s">So</a> I think it's time that we do get this information before this project begins to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2753.211s">Now,</a> the other part of the problem seems to be, could possibly be political in nature because if in fact, uh, if the Malden mayor and the Councilor from that particular district was there and they're all on board in this, and now all of a sudden, uh, our questions are going to present a block to maybe the proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2768.864s">Um,</a> does this become a political, um, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2771.618s">Does</a> this become a political issue on who's going to have more power and who's going to have more might? <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2775.822s">I'm</a> from the city of Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2776.863s">If</a> 99% of the property is on, is in my territory, who are you from the city of Medford to tell me what you can and can't do in my piece of property? <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2784.89s">I</a> think the linchpin here is the nine units of the 17 that are in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2789.394s">And</a> that to me is the issue that I would make a presentation on. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2792.457s">Number</a> one, you chief, from what I understand the way the law goes, you could close that road down tomorrow morning if you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2800.677s">that</a> cut through tomorrow morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2801.918s">If</a> you want you could go there, just close it down in the interest of public safety.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3636.637s">First</a> of all, um, for the purposes of identifying my colleague, my newest colleague on there, this council does have a representative. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3644.942s">It's</a> part of the legislation that was passed back in the late nineties, late nineties. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3649.584s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3650.365s">We</a> have a definite role by being on that board. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3654.287s">The</a> board meets approximately once a month, if not, <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3658.203s">maybe</a> once every six weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3660.143s">And</a> the purpose of the board is to enhance the viability of the Sheppard Brooks estates, um, which serves an educational and a, um, historical purpose here for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3673.906s">Second</a> of all, um, you were given a book, I believe when you first got elected that showed you the whole intent and of what the, <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3683.529s">background</a> was of the Brooks estates. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3686.011s">Um,</a> it had an in depth detail of where it came from, um, how it got itself started and the endeavor that it's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3693.596s">And</a> we all know that it's, um, it's, it's, it's a long, hard endeavor, which includes a road in a building upgrade of approximately three and a half million dollars to get itself back on the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3705.263s">Um,</a> the purpose of the legislative person, be it myself, who has sat on that board is to enhance, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3712.908s">not</a> only the viability of the Shepard Brooks Estates, by supporting and not supporting, depending on what takes place at our monthly meetings, for which are publicly noticed out in the clerk's office, for which minutes of the meetings are readily available if anyone so chose to go look at them and to see what is being discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3732.48s">I</a> feel quite confident that my role and my position on the board has not only satisfied the responsibility of a Councilor sitting on that board, but at the same time, <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3740.857s">It's</a> part of the legislative obligation, which is part of the law that was passed and duly recorded at the Middlesex Registry Deeds for this particular position. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3750.463s">But</a> if Councilor Knight has an issue with that, I- Point of information, Councilor Knight.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4127.195s">It</a> was a council president who made the appointment, which was Bob Mayorka. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4131.337s">Jay</a> Griffin proposed.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4154.229s">I</a> believe before the role is called that this discussion has come up before with the city clerk, uh, straight to the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4160.248s">regarding</a> my position and it's duly recorded in your office, Mr. Clerk and the city solicitor's vendors opinion that it's acceptable for me to serve in this position.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4178.175s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4338.084s">I</a> was hoping he was going to stay. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4339.365s">Um,</a> over this past weekend, I received a telephone calls and six emails from folks from Mammoth street, <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4346.069s">Blakely</a> Road, and other locations, where they received robocalls as it related their streets were going to be swept on the 17th and the 18th, respectively. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4354.951s">And</a> streets were never swept, tagged, ticketed, and towed. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4359.212s">My</a> comment on that particular issue, Mr. President, is very simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4364.073s">If</a> you were tagged, ticketed, or towed, and any one of the robocalls that went out or any way your houses were identified that your streets were going to be swept, I think you should come to City Hall, go to the mayor's office, and demand your money back. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4375.198s">This</a> is absolutely wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4376.678s">It's</a> unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4377.899s">You</a> don't turn around and tell the people and the streets as of this day has still not been swept. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4382.439s">You</a> don't have people get all excited to move their cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4384.36s">And</a> if they're going to get a ticket or toad, if they don't do it, and then when they do get ticket and toad and the street never gets itself swept, that even adds to the, to the anxiety. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4393.021s">And</a> as we speak right now, it continues to add to the anxiety. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4396.242s">So</a> I just think it's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4397.182s">I</a> think the procedure is wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4398.723s">If</a> there's a reason why the streets weren't swept, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4401.678s">Those</a> people should be notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4403.299s">If</a> you got a ticket, you got tagged and you got towed, bring it to city hall and it should be, and it should be reflected. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4408.763s">If</a> I remember correctly, at some point in time last year, a situation like this happened and I believe the mayor made an announcement that he would take and bring whoever got him during the specific period for whatever the issue was, bring them to city hall and they would be abated. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4420.97s">So</a> that would be my suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4422.091s">I</a> was hoping the chief was going to stay for this because it was on the agenda and I know he was CC'd on some of these requests that, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4429.089s">I</a> don't have an answer because nobody can tell us why the streets weren't swept. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4431.851s">I</a> don't know, but they weren't. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4433.331s">But</a> all I know is this, that people did get tagged, ticketed, and towed. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4436.433s">And</a> as a result of that, they should be entitled to get their money back. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4441.736s">And</a> that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4442.276s">I</a> just, I don't understand it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4596.091s">Councilor</a> Pentland. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4596.811s">Just</a> to re-up this because, you know, this is going to present itself with another issue forthcoming this winter as it relates to snow emergencies and how they're going to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4605.596s">You</a> know, not everybody goes to their computer every day to go on the city's webpage to see what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4611.338s">People</a> have other more important things to do like their job, their family, their kids, and making sure they stay alive with their job and making sure payments are being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4619.862s">So</a> to turn around and say you should have gone to the city's website, bingo. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4623.204s">And</a> if you didn't watch the city's website, well, what was the other alternative? <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4627.327s">Now</a> we're going to do robocalls. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4628.508s">So</a> the robocalls go out. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4630.31s">And</a> when the robocalls go out, and the people do get them, and they do follow them, and they do subscribe to them, and nothing takes place, and then you penalize the taxpayer, I mean, where does that put us? <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4642.719s">We</a> were told when we had this discussion last year after, I believe it was the snow emergency, and I think it was at your behest, <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4649.201s">Councilor</a> Langel-Curran, when we were talking about off of, uh, off of, uh, by Magoon Park, those streets there where the neighbors came down and they wanted to have an opportunity to park on their street until the, until the, uh, I can't think of the name of the street and the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4665.834s">And</a> we have the chief of police down here and we have the people from the department of public works down here to allow the people to park on the street rather than in the wintertime, you only can park on one side of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4673.981s">Do</a> you remember? <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4675.577s">And</a> we had that discussion and we were, we were informed that we were going to discuss that in the same way we were going to discuss the issue that we have here in front of us right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4684.038s">And</a> it's right back in our face all over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4686.459s">So</a> I don't know what it takes. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4687.839s">I</a> don't know how it's run. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4689.039s">The</a> police don't go down the street anymore with the bullhorn telling the people, you know, to get your cars off the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4694.14s">It's</a> being told the department of public works won't do it because all they do is get to go down the street with a lead man and the sweet stripper goes down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4702.442s">So</a> who's going to hear that particular person? <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4704.618s">and</a> when in fact that takes place. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4706.739s">So</a> we do definitely have a problem here as it relates to not only snow removal, which is going to be forthcoming, but also with these issues of getting these robocalls and the city not doing that for which they're telling residents to do and the residents get ticket tagged and towed. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4720.125s">So</a> once again, anyone who was ticket tagged and towed, if you got a robocall and they never came and swept your street and it still isn't swept, I would suggest that you go to city hall, go to the mayor's office and demand that you want your money back <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4732.288s">and</a> that you do not want that attached to your driver's license or your registration to your car. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4737.991s">Because</a> it's just unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4740.653s">One</a> of the memos that I got, a lady came home and her car was gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4744.615s">Her</a> car was gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4745.536s">And</a> there was no reason why the car should be gone, because the street wasn't there. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4748.458s">She</a> had to pick up her son. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4749.478s">She</a> had no money, and she had no car. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4751.539s">And</a> she had to do something on the alternative to do that, because she did what she was supposed to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4756.582s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, that's my resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4761.679s">Anyone</a> that got it, please go to the, uh, and I would suggest still keep sending your emails to the chief of police, the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4769.023s">If</a> this is continuing to go on, to go on in other parts of the city, then that's what you need to do because there's no form there. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4776.207s">You</a> talk about having a system to vet out councils and positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4780.869s">Well,</a> maybe we should have a system to vet out our administrators as to what they're supposed to do when they say they're going to do something.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4789.974s">Yeah,</a> I know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4791.035s">I</a> know that election every two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4793.398s">So</a> with that being said, uh, Mr. President, I move the issue on the motion of council.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4798.703s">Roll</a> call vote.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4823.631s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4824.632s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4932.33s">We</a> also got tonight in our packet, I got both of those things you just talked about, I didn't get. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4938.552s">I</a> got them both. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4939.533s">I</a> didn't get them. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4941.814s">Did</a> you get them? <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4943.894s">We</a> also received a notice of a public hearing scheduled for December 10th regarding the Peace Garden. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4950.136s">And</a> this is really confusing right now, because now what it's saying, the State Department of Transportation is stating the following, <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4958.48s">that</a> a secure right of way is necessary for this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4961.802s">Acquisitions</a> in fee and permanent or temporary easements may be required. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4967.065s">The</a> city is responsible for acquiring all needed rights in private or public lands. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4972.007s">MassDOT's</a> policy concerning land acquisitions will be discussed at this hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4977.41s">This</a> is something that's absolutely brand new. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4979.051s">I</a> believe, Mr. President, the city of Medford, in this particular issue, is the owner of the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4989.103s">And</a> being the owner of the property, it's a city owned piece of property. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4995.046s">And</a> I don't understand this right of way and this easement, permanent or temporary. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5000.489s">We've</a> never been advised of anything like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5002.75s">And</a> I think we need to have a report back as to why MassDOT is coming in as it relates to our public lands, whether it's the housing authority of the city of Medford, it's still the public lands of the city of Medford and they're not private. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5015.816s">And</a> with that being said, MassDOT, <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5018.703s">I</a> just don't understand how they can, why are we getting this at this stage of the game? <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5023.747s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5024.748s">We're</a> talking about, uh, and we're still waiting for a budget director Burke to give us the financial background of how much has been raised so far for this peace garden. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5034.176s">And</a> now we have to deal with a public hearing regarding a right of way or an easement permanent or temporary that comes under the subject policy of mass dot. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5043.923s">And</a> they haven't a public hearing on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5045.164s">So,</a> I mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5046.975s">Can</a> we get a response back from the office of community development on this?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5054.742s">And</a> as to why, why we're having, I mean, what are we, what are we acquiring that we don't already own? <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5060.767s">That's</a> what I want to know.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5071.763s">The</a> meeting is December 10th. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5072.964s">We've</a> been told all along, none of this has ever come up under any of the discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5077.527s">Whether</a> it's money that's been taken out of the linkage account, whether it's money that's been taken out of the community walk-around funds, whether it's money taken out of the city's coffers. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5084.852s">There's</a> been no, this has never come up before. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5087.053s">Now</a> all of a sudden, the Mass Department of Transportation, <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5090.297s">is</a> sticking its two cents in, either the city didn't do something, or there's something that we're not aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5095.501s">And</a> I think we should become aware of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5097.382s">I</a> don't want to go to a meeting on December 10th and go and ask questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5100.224s">I</a> want to know ahead of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5101.465s">I've</a> taken votes in this council for the purpose of putting money toward that Peace Garden. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5105.367s">We've</a> taken votes off this council from the linkage accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5108.229s">I'm</a> not waiting until December 10th. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5110.111s">This</a> is too important an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5111.271s">It's</a> well in excess of a million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5113.933s">And</a> being in excess of that kind of money, and it's being on our city property, why does the Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5118.356s">Department</a> of Transportation <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5119.828s">have</a> to have this public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5122.589s">And</a> I think it's a valid question.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5127.851s">Well,</a> if it wasn't city property, you wouldn't be getting this notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5130.532s">So</a> there must be something that either we weren't apprised of or the city wasn't aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5134.493s">And</a> I think we should become aware of it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5143.757s">It</a> says in the second paragraph, Mr. President, it's in a question form. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5147.685s">The</a> city is responsible for acquiring all needed rights and private lands. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5150.946s">Mass</a> DOT's policy concerning land acquisitions will be discussed at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5155.147s">What's</a> the land acquisition? <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5156.307s">We</a> were told from day one that's our property. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5158.528s">We</a> own it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5159.388s">Now,</a> if we're buying property, that's another issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5161.769s">I'd</a> like to know what we're buying.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_IndO1QdhX3w/2025-03-21_IndO1QdhX3w.html">Medford City Council - November 18, 2014</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=263.036s">Mr.</a> President, before we move approval for what you can't, you have to take each item one at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=268.541s">That's</a> required by state statute. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=270.082s">Also,</a> earlier tonight at 445, I believe that there was a linkage committee meeting that took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=276.228s">And</a> I think you should read the agenda items that were passed on there to put the entire total to close to $1,800,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=283.034s">I</a> think it's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=285.116s">I</a> think it works hand in hand.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=400.067s">Um,</a> and as required by law, uh, we should be discussing each one of these, uh, one at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=405.388s">So</a> there's a complete understanding as to what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=408.529s">I'd</a> like to just jump to the link. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=410.009s">Did</a> you attend the meeting this afternoon or not? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=411.649s">I</a> did. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=412.39s">Um,</a> I'm concerned over two of the items that are on there, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=415.77s">Um,</a> the first one is, um, why are we leasing two trucks for the highway division, uh, for $22,000 a year? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=423.332s">Uh,</a> how much were those trucks each if you had to buy them? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=426.793s">And</a> once again, second of all, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=429.047s">the</a> one-year lease for an F-250 for $26,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=432.15s">There's</a> no paperwork that's supplied with this explaining the difference between the leasing and the buying. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=441.058s">And</a> also, leasing the Bobcat for one year at $10,000 a year, how much would that cost if we were to buy it? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=448.224s">We're</a> out there now building a brand new $14 million public works building, state of the art.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=472.435s">Plus</a> the fact, Mr. President, since you as the chairperson of the council sit on that committee, I believe it is pertinent and it's relative to the issue at hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=480.941s">Um,</a> can we have some explanation, um, from you? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=483.383s">Cause</a> you're the only one either that or is miss Baker here?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=497.393s">So,</a> um, could Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=500.074s">Baker,</a> please be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=500.954s">I'd</a> like to have her. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=501.594s">She</a> was, she's a member.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=503.215s">Oh,</a> she's not here. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=504.776s">Well</a> then can you, on behalf of the council and likeness, why the committee of three voted to <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=510.397s">lease</a> rather than by the funds.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=523.538s">No,</a> I'm going to item number seven, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=525.419s">You</a> asked about the two trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=526.981s">Yeah,</a> the two trucks, the two F-150s, two F-250s. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=529.603s">And</a> I just answered that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=531.405s">It's</a> year one of the lease.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=535.248s">I</a> didn't say number four. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=536.69s">Well,</a> anyway, all right, I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=538.831s">It's</a> number seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=540.173s">Why</a> are we leasing?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=561.752s">Well,</a> since you're a representative and it also talks about a one year lease. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=565.674s">So</a> we're just leasing them for one year or for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=569.416s">It's</a> to pay for one year lease.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=600.72s">Is</a> our budget director, can she answer the question please? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=603.723s">Number</a> seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=606.825s">How</a> many years is this lease for?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=614.412s">Four</a> payments of $26,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=615.172s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=615.413s">So</a> almost $100,000 for this one truck.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=656.693s">What</a> does the city get out of leasing them at the end of two years? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=659.134s">Three</a> years?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=671.14s">Would</a> it be cheaper for the city?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=687.08s">And</a> if you jump to number five, why are we renting a Bobcat for $10,000?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=693.863s">How</a> much does that go for, Brando?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=698.026s">And</a> how long are we paying that out for?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=706.31s">The</a> last part of the question to this is why this didn't come out of free cash?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=877.522s">Mr.</a> President, let's go to number two, request funds to pay for stumps and sidewalks, $100,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=882.905s">Now</a> I'm confused because in the mayor's other request from free cash, he wants 400,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=889.147s">Why</a> this didn't all just come from one account?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=910.629s">So</a> the $400,000 in free cash should be free?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=916.753s">No,</a> I didn't get that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=922.135s">The</a> bottom line number of 1, 3, 8, 6 is still correct.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=939.563s">Uh,</a> paper 14-743. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=941.544s">That</a> particular paper has to be voted on individually. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=945.846s">Each</a> item, Mr. President, that's what the law reads. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=948.948s">It's</a> a cost factor.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1101.316s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1102.337s">Councilor</a> Penta.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1134.679s">Well,</a> I think the taxpayers are owed the obligation of knowing <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1138.965s">how</a> this money is going to be spent, whether it's severed or not, whether the total stays the same, or whether it's lessened by some amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1146.19s">I</a> think it's important that each item is discussed, and the Council can take its vote.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1151.653s">I</a> make a motion to sever every one of the items.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1512.871s">Councilor</a> Penta for the voters call. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1514.712s">And</a> since there are a lot of items in here that will have an impact in certain parts of the community and especially for which a rate payers and taxpayers in this community aren't aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1525.741s">And</a> as Councilor Knight is just alluded to, he thinks it's a great package. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1529.464s">So</a> I would assume there'd be no problem discussing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1532.125s">and</a> letting the taxpayers know what they're getting by dollar amount to each and every one of the items. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1536.126s">So</a> I support the, uh, I support the, uh, severing of the motion.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1567.561s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President point of information under rule 20 of our city council talks about items appearing upon the council agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1575.827s">Point</a> number four, any financial paper appearing on the council agenda for the first time shall be automatically laid on the table for one week when such action is requested by any Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1586.135s">I</a> am the Councilor and I'm making that action that the paper lay on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1589.898s">according</a> to our own rules.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1594.001s">No,</a> it's automatic. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1597.003s">Lays</a> on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1598.564s">Roll</a> number 20.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1608.31s">I</a> don't think there's any problem discussing, and I don't know why four colleagues would not want to discuss some of this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1613.814s">And</a> pardon me.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1616.763s">Well,</a> you were at a meeting that the public couldn't see. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1619.504s">It</a> was a private meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1620.364s">With</a> all due respect. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1621.424s">It</a> was a committee of the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1622.424s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1637.647s">Well,</a> some members of the public was put there. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1639.407s">No,</a> no, no, no, no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1640.147s">Some</a> members of the public, which would be the people who watched this.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1658.14s">You</a> didn't correct it for me.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2204.933s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2206.013s">One</a> thing further under rule 20, number one, all items of business appearing upon the council agenda shall be taken up in the order of their appearance and be fully in. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2214.218s">And</a> the appearance was under suspension and be fully and openly debated <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2217.142s">and</a> disposed of by a vote of the council previous to consideration of any other item of business. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2222.126s">And</a> then we jumped to rule four for which is mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2225.008s">So</a> it lays on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2226.69s">The</a> council took this no matter how it appeared before the council.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2522.586s">That</a> came up as a separate paper on the suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2525.208s">We're</a> going to be here all night discussing. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2526.529s">This</a> is a circus. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2527.249s">I</a> know this is a circus. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2529.531s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2530.192s">You</a> challenge the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2531.172s">Let</a> me tell you something. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2531.873s">Let</a> me just say this too. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2533.134s">I</a> don't know what any of the seven of us or any of the four who didn't vote for this, <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2537.447s">would</a> be afraid to discuss these matters one at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2539.407s">Councilor,</a> that's a different point right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2540.528s">No,</a> it isn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2540.868s">That's</a> the whole issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2541.688s">You</a> don't want to discuss it, because Councilor Dello Russo brought that up in the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2545.189s">He</a> just wanted to move to approve the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2546.929s">That's</a> how this all started. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2548.589s">Now,</a> you have the budget director here, who's ready, willing, and able to answer any question that's going to be presented as to what took place in the Committee of the Law. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2555.291s">What</a> is everybody afraid of to talk about? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2557.011s">Councilor,</a> nobody said you could ask that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2558.312s">Well,</a> then that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2558.732s">Then</a> let it go. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2559.312s">Just</a> let us have our discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2560.632s">Of</a> course.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2601.618s">No,</a> Mr. President, you know, you've got to read 33 that you're alluding to. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2606.799s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2608.2s">Read</a> it, read 33 if you want to have suspension of the rules and make this become operative. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2614.34s">It</a> talks about a roll call, a salute to the flag, examination of the records of a previous meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2619.242s">It</a> talks about hearings, presentations of petitions and similar papers, motions, orders, and resolutions, communications from the mayor, communications and reports from city office and employees, reports of committee, public participation papers in the committee, unfinished business and approval of records in previous meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2635.569s">You</a> move suspension on one of these items. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2637.949s">It's</a> just that one particular paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2640.11s">You</a> took it out of order.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2678.003s">He</a> moved suspension of the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2678.823s">He</a> didn't move suspension of the rules for all the rules of the Council.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2723.362s">Good.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2724.284s">I'll</a> be willing to withdraw my, and if council agrees to talk about these items, one at a time, I'm telling you, I'll be willing to withdraw that if the council acknowledges. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2733.973s">discussing</a> these matters one at a time.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2809.589s">Now</a> what you're saying is if somebody on the prevailing side is willing to move reconsideration so we can discuss these items one at a time, then roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2817.656s">to</a> take a vote on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2819.497s">I'm</a> not taking that gamble because I can't trust this council.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2885.334s">Well,</a> you can... I'd like to ask Councilor Dello Russo a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2891.056s">Councilor</a> Dello Russo.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2897.197s">You</a> said anybody can ask the budget director any... <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2899.888s">Councilor</a> Dello Russo, first, a question before we go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2903.689s">Since</a> you moved, Councilor Dello Russo, to vote for this paper, would you be good?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2909.191s">I'm</a> asking Councilor Dello Russo, and you're speaking from the chair.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2922.734s">Very</a> simply, Councilor Dello Russo, you moved approval on a paper without having an opportunity be given to discuss each and every one of these items. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2929.868s">Would</a> you be willing to withdraw that so we could discuss these items?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2989.751s">Why</a> would you not want to let your colleagues have an opportunity to ask further questions to Mrs. Burke?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=3014.348s">Let's</a> go to the issue of the three retaining walls, Governor's Ave, Morgan, and Gaston. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=3020.691s">Now,</a> Governor's Ave was done back in the early 2000s. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=3025.874s">What</a> part of Governor's Ave in particular? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=3027.715s">Because</a> residents have called, and they want to know what's going on.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=3037.8s">Going</a> toward Lawrence Road?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=3039.701s">OK.</a>

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=3052.499s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=3054.32s">And</a> these prices of $250,000, do these come from, I won't use, well, not legitimate.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=3062.465s">You</a> have, yeah, OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=3063.765s">These</a> aren't city estimates. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=3065.166s">These</a> are from definite contractors.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=3069.989s">Outside</a> engineer, OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=3073.725s">The</a> next question is, you corrected the stumps to $300,000, and the bucket truck for $65,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=3079.589s">Again,</a> the bucket truck for $65,000, and then we have the trucks that come under linkage. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=3088.556s">Is</a> there any reason why it just all didn't stay out of one account?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=3107.625s">Next</a> one is, um, the tennis courts at victory and the basketball, um, horizon, the basketball play stood tennis courts, Morris and the tennis courts, basketball courts at, um, at Duggar tennis courts at Duggar Harris. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=3122.804s">A</a> lot of these parks through the years, as you know, and even when you were on the council, have seen upgradings through the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=3129.852s">Some</a> of these parks are in their third iteration of being upgraded. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=3133.516s">And</a> I just want to hold that aside as, as Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=3137.321s">Mott</a> indicated a little bit back there. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=3140.905s">The</a> city hall fire alarm system, the upgrade to that,
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=3166.289s">So</a> these are all citywide buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=3168.17s">When</a> you say city, we, including the school department or not?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=3172.312s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=3174.016s">The</a> pads for the fire alarm installation citywide.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4106.409s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4131.412s">I</a> mean, that- Well, I don't see anything in here, to be honest with you, as it relates to the city going out through the Office of Community Development as it relates to the business district. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4140.518s">I</a> don't see anything like that there at all.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4145.022s">It</a> might fall into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4145.902s">But</a> if we're sitting on almost $7.5, $7.8 million in free cash, <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4151.998s">something</a> needs to be said, I think, as far as that part goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4155.52s">Also,</a> when we talk about signs, and I think it was our chief that was seen on Channel 7 last week as he relates to signage in the city of Medford and his remarks, we don't have enough money. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4167.145s">We</a> don't have any money to do the signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4169.386s">And</a> I don't understand we don't have enough money to do the signage when we have almost $7.8 million in free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4177.37s">And</a> then when I look at the fact that under the linkage program, <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4181.513s">you're</a> requesting, I think it's $8,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4183.214s">What</a> is the linkage? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4188.257s">$8,000</a> to do signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4190.758s">And</a> it's my understanding, if I'm reading the contract correctly, from Tennessee, what's the name of the place?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4204.365s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4206.467s">So</a> you're talking about a street name sign?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4209.968s">Oh.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4210.469s">We'll</a> see. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4211.365s">I</a> think that needs to be more specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4214.426s">And</a> also, we were supposed to be getting a report back as a follow-up, because I've spoken to some of the business people as it relates to Republic going into some of these certain business folks, and there's still some concern over who was going to be gifted with the free 30-minute parking spaces, who was going to be gifted with the sign and the repair of the signs that they're supposed to be putting up, who was going to be exempt in the business districts from not having it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4241.423s">Again,</a> I think the council had asked for that type of information to be forthcoming, and we haven't seen or heard anything.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4272.718s">Mr.</a> President, I'd like to move that the $250,000 that was announced tonight by the Wynn Casino Group, that they may report back and respectfully ask of the council of what particular projects they might be interested in that this $250,000 could be used for.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4319.537s">No,</a> it doesn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4320.478s">No,</a> no, it'd be a B paper, whatever you want to call it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4340.585s">Well,</a> we had asked before, since you've digressed over there.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4345.267s">Oh,</a> yeah, you're responding, right. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4347.228s">But</a> the mayor indicated that he's had all kinds of money coming in fast and furious. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4351.05s">This</a> is a million dollar peace garden. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4353.511s">And</a> we haven't seen anything as a report. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4355.552s">Just</a> itemize where the money's coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4358.273s">It's</a> coming from linkage. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4359.174s">It's</a> coming from community block grant funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4360.975s">It's</a> coming from city finances. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4362.355s">It's</a> supposedly coming from private finances. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4364.917s">And</a> now you're saying Wynn has given another $200,000.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4397.815s">Has</a> the whole $250,000 been earmarked?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4409.831s">Well,</a> I guess we, I guess we.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4413.972s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4414.292s">You</a> want a breakdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4414.993s">I</a> want a breakdown of the money, therefore brought in.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4418.774s">All</a> funding.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4420.134s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4440.309s">No,</a> no, and the breakdown of the money, the funding thus far. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4444.85s">Correct,</a> okay.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4447.971s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4638.623s">I</a> believe we were told it was approximately 30 years left.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4652.211s">Well,</a> you have the new growth over there that's taking place now. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4654.372s">You</a> have six and a half acres on the opposite side from the Brooks Estates area.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4659.257s">From</a> who though?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4663.159s">Could</a> we further amend that? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4664.56s">Tell</a> us to give us a breakdown, a layout, what they anticipate and for the years, how they made that determination. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4671.344s">Anticipated?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4673.085s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4673.745s">Locations.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4674.386s">The</a> actual physical locations at the cemetery.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4678.288s">Of</a> the 10 year. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4678.968s">And</a> many people are dying per year.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=4683.751s">Oh,</a> they could, but that doesn't mean that it's going to be used.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5240.974s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5242.754s">Stephanie,</a> go back to the retaining walls on Governor's Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5246.955s">You</a> just jogged my mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5248.375s">When</a> we did those walls back then, we had to go and get permission from the abutting residents that abutted the wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5255.577s">And</a> the purpose of doing that was to cut the trees down that were <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5259.337s">having</a> their roots pushing the wall out. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5262.419s">Now,</a> nothing's been done since then to go back on the wall that we spent a few hundred thousand dollars on and now you're adding on. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5269.525s">I'm</a> just, can we get a report back as to why the city has not kept up with stopping those trees from regrowing?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5278.232s">Well,</a> not only that, it's the trees that maybe three to four feet, you know, you have the wall and then there's three or four feet going back on the land over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5287.219s">And</a> that was the, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5289.07s">That</a> was the thing that was negotiated by the city and the residents, making sure that you weren't on their property. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5294.151s">It</a> was the city's property. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5295.212s">And</a> they cut those trees down, making sure that the growth of those trees were not pushing the wall out. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5300.913s">But</a> since that wall has been fixed, the trees have regrown. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5303.834s">You</a> have new trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5305.254s">And</a> they're doing the same thing with the new addition of the wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5312.696s">And</a> the second thing, Mr. President, just jumping back onto the Peace Garden. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5316.708s">I</a> think this was brought up, and I don't know who brought it up, but if and when this thing is finally built, who's going to take care of it?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5325.934s">City</a> of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5327.075s">Highway</a> department's going to take care of it?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5329.637s">Parks</a> department's going to take care of it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5384.73s">Mr.</a> President, could you explain further, um, if the 250,000 from when what's the next payment after that?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5408.971s">So</a> that's not going to be the same as Everett getting millions of dollars each and every year, even before they open? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5413.193s">Not</a> until the doors open. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5420.556s">And</a> maybe you can answer this question, and then I'm done. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5424.822s">Um,</a> with these new kiosks that are coming in, um, that the council never had a final vote on, but that's beside the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5433.806s">How</a> is the city going to, we have educated drivers out there and speaking to a couple of the people right now that from Winchester that are parking here, once they realize they're going to get tagged, they're not going to stay here. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5447.351s">So</a> who's going to make up that difference of the $2 million per year? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5451.25s">You</a> think Medford residents are gonna go out there and get themselves tagged for $2 million a year? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5455.133s">I</a> don't think so.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5480.73s">But</a> there is a provisional in the contract that if they do less than $2 million a year, it gets prorated down as to what the city gets, correct?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5518.908s">And</a> lastly, Mr. President, we were supposed to have gotten an update, and we never got it, regarding the West Method parking lot, where we stand, what's the cost factor going to involve, what's the process, how is this contamination going to be eliminated? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5533.859s">But</a> isn't the city putting any money aside because they're going to have to come up with some money for this?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5963.796s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5965.437s">We</a> have another paper that's due next.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5973.643s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5974.263s">What</a> account did that come out of?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5979.206s">Same</a> account? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5980.447s">Free</a> cash? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=5982.328s">Why</a> isn't it on here?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=6023.813s">The</a> chair recognizes Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=6025.674s">Mr.</a> President, I move that we take the paper as it relates to the Berks Estates, paper number, which one is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=6033.598s">All</a> those in favor, hear that paper? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=6034.999s">All</a> those opposed, the paper is back before you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=6115.684s">Once</a> again, it would be nice to have how $90,000 is going to be expended. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=6120.668s">Even</a> though Councilor DelaRosa moved approval, I think it's important for people to know how their money is being expended and its purpose.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=7806.04s">Mr.</a> President, move. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=7808.1s">Councilor</a> Penta? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=7809.06s">Is</a> the gentleman here in the audience? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=7810.261s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=7812.021s">He's</a> not here. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=7812.901s">Lay</a> the paper on the table, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=7852.759s">Lay</a> it on the table.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8009.568s">Mr.</a> President, I've been asked by many people, and I forgot to do this last year, so I'm doing it this year, well in advance. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8018.754s">And</a> as a result of what's been going on throughout this entire country of ours, between atheists and people of non-Christian Judeo faith slamming the Christmas season, wanting to take Christ out of Christmas, and just absolutely have an atheistic type of an attitude as it relates to <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8037.593s">you</a> know, what this country should be rather than what it really is. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8040.574s">I</a> think we as a city need to step up to the plate and let people know that we are a Christian-Judeo community, born on the principles of a country that was founded on that religious belief, and not be subject to threats or intimidation from folks who are either atheistic or are not our religious persuasions. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8063.301s">At</a> the same time, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8066.082s">I</a> think, you know, when we have our Christmas holiday season, and I think it's next week we're going to be having, or two weeks from now, we're going to be having a Christmas bonanza here out in City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8076.704s">You're</a> going to have Santa Claus, which is Saint Nicholas, which stems from some type of religious connotation from being a saint, I believe, from Scotland, dating back to when this whole situation started. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8090.787s">Why</a> should we be subject or letting ourselves as a community be subject to anything <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8096.19s">by</a> way of threat or intimidation. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8097.891s">I</a> think we should just stand tall, put the nativity scene back. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8101.053s">If</a> nobody wants to honor it, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8103.735s">But</a> it's part of our American heritage. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8105.697s">It's</a> part of our city of Medford's heritage. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8108.218s">And</a> to start letting go of these things slowly but surely, it makes no sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8114.022s">I</a> don't know if any of you folks read it, but there was an article written by a pilot from American Airlines. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8120.827s">And</a> he also was a pilot that flew <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8125.387s">flew</a> on the day of September 11th, when we were attacked crazily by a group of fanatical Muslims, Arab Muslims. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8134.609s">And</a> he writes a very interesting story, as was presented in the news media. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8141.07s">He</a> has seen all kinds of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8142.55s">He</a> has flown all kinds of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8145.391s">And</a> he has no problem with all kinds of people that have been flying and coming into this country, whether they legally, as immigrants. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8153.713s">But</a> those that are here, <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8155.657s">have</a> a responsibility to stand up for people of their nations, not of American, that are destroying us. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8164.442s">And</a> I think a couple of weeks ago on 60 Minutes, there was a story relative toward the Islamic jihadist. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8172.686s">This</a> is after, I think, the third American was killed or beheaded. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8177.529s">And</a> basically saying, we're going to get the Americans, and we're going to get the French, because those are the two that he singled out, and we're going <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8184.368s">make</a> you become under our way, and we will behead you if we have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8188.972s">Those</a> type of people of that particular faith are living in this country. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8192.855s">And</a> I think they have a responsibility to stand up and saying that they are not part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8197.499s">They</a> need to stand up and say, you know, we are good Muslims. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8200.962s">We</a> have come here to this country, and we have subscribed to the American way of living. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8204.805s">And</a> part of our American way of living is our holidays. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8208.348s">Now,</a> you have in Maryland, you have one parent who is an atheist. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8214.126s">who</a> has now stopped all the holiday season in the Maryland school district only because of the reason that they're an atheist and they don't want their child to be subject to the Judeo-Christian way of having a Christmas. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8228.275s">So</a> what the school system did in Maryland, what they did is they got rid of all connotations and any names relative toward the Christmas season <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8237.791s">and</a> just calling it a holiday. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8238.952s">Well,</a> what kind of a holiday is it, if anybody can explain it? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8242.334s">The</a> holiday has always been representative of Christmas. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8245.396s">And</a> it's always been tolerant of the Judeo-Christian background. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8249.318s">And</a> I think it's been tolerant of every other type of religion that this country has allowed to have their expressions of freedom of peace and freedom of speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8258.324s">But</a> to turn around and take away something that's a main staple of this country is wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8263.327s">And</a> people need to start speaking up. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8265.331s">And</a> news media needs to start speaking up and not going along and coddling those people who just plainly are indifferent to our American way of living. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8274.298s">If</a> they don't like our American way, then move out. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8276.52s">Get</a> out of here. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8277.521s">Why</a> does everybody want to come to this country? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8279.642s">They</a> come here to get their welfare. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8281.344s">They</a> come here to get their housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8283.085s">They</a> come here to get their illegal driver's license. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8285.787s">And</a> they come here to get sometimes an illegal education at the expense of those people who pay for it, whose families have paid for it, who have earned it through the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8294.322s">So</a> all I'm saying, Mr. President, and anyone who might be watching — and I don't know if the news media is here — Christmas is a very happy time of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8302.966s">Sure,</a> to some folks, it has a sacred connotation. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8305.567s">And</a> if you don't want to accept it, you don't have to buy into it or believe it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8309.509s">But</a> don't be so stupid enough to get rid of it because we're offending somebody. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8313.35s">What</a> about the people that they're offending by asking us to get rid of it? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8316.452s">That</a> doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8319.353s">And</a> no kid and no child should be died <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8321.91s">what</a> Christmas, what the New Year's is, what St. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8324.352s">Nicholas</a> is all about, and what their religious holiday is during this time of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8329.575s">If</a> not, then we should just abolish holidays and just not have a Christmas or a holiday season. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8335.899s">It</a> had to be there for some reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8337.841s">It's</a> a multi-million dollar market for corporate America. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8342.106s">For</a> games, for toys, for clothes, just put on the television and you'll see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8346.629s">And</a> you'll see Santa Claus. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8348.25s">And</a> I'll tell you one thing, I give credit to the people who are advertising now on television, they're using the word Merry Christmas. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8354.533s">They're</a> using the word Merry Christmas, and that's the way it should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8357.235s">It</a> is a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8359.696s">And</a> I'll repeat, if you don't like it, then move out. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8362.558s">And</a> I would hope that this city does nothing, does nothing to follow suit of some of these other cities and some of these other towns who are being challenged <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8372.093s">by</a> folks who are so indifferent to our American way of living. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8376.095s">So</a> I move the question, Mr. President, and ask that the mayor put for this holiday, Christmas season, for the Christmas, New Year's, the nativity scene that sits at that Royal House Park as it did for so many years.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8613.304s">Councilor</a> Penta, uh, Jeannie, you know, our country was founded on two specific beliefs, um, numb freedom of speech and freedom of religion. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8621.492s">And</a> the doors to the Supreme Court of the United States, you know what they have on them?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8627.875s">They</a> have the Ten Commandments.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8629.295s">And</a> when you go to court, what do you do? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8630.836s">You</a> put your hand on the Bible to tell the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8632.656s">That's</a> true. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8632.976s">Correct?</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8634.717s">You</a> can say I affirm.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8638.338s">OK,</a> so you believe.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8640.339s">And</a> you just indicated, and you alluded to the fact that your neighbor gave you a Christmas gift. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8643.961s">And</a> whether it's responsive to something maybe that you did, or she's just honoring you because this is what we do here in this country. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8650.544s">then</a> so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8651.204s">But</a> I'm not talking about her. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8652.585s">I'm</a> talking about the crazies that are out there, the people that don't like us, don't like our country. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8657.909s">I'm</a> talking about the people that are extremely irrational and don't and won't accept our American way of living. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8663.633s">But</a> they're here in this country and they're doing everything in their power while they're here in this country to lessen the freedoms and everything that we've enjoyed, as you just indicated as a child growing up. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8674.44s">And</a> I don't think there's anything wrong with the nativity scene, just like I don't think there's anything wrong with having a Christmas party out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8680.18s">But</a> if you're not going to have the nativity scene, then don't have St. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8682.702s">Nicholas,</a> because there's a religious connotation that goes with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8685.863s">So</a> what are you going to tell the kids? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8687.565s">Oh,</a> it's just a winter holiday. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8689.726s">You</a> can come out here and we'll have hot dogs and donuts and popcorn, but we're Santa Claus. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8695.369s">What</a> are you going to tell all these kids, three, four, five, six, and seven, eight years old, or whenever they believe and they don't believe? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8700.492s">What</a> are you going to tell the parents? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8702.894s">This</a> is part of our American tradition and our heritage. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8707.129s">And</a> this is not saying it's religious. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8709.67s">If</a> you don't want to buy into it or believe in it, you don't have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8713.492s">Nobody</a> is stopping anyone else from having their type of religious holiday. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8717.914s">But</a> when someone tries to destroy ours, either by being an atheist or being someone from a foreign country who just doesn't believe in our way of living, and they're hearing this country, then get out of here. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8729.8s">If</a> you don't like it, go. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8731.3s">Nobody's</a> telling you to stay here. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8733.261s">But</a> they must seem to like it enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8735.022s">They</a> must give enough perks. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8737.426s">OK,</a> to get what they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8739.187s">I'm</a> not backing off. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8739.987s">I'm</a> going to ask for a roll call vote on this, because I think this is very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8743.089s">It's</a> been part of the city of Medford's history. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8745.21s">And</a> if you read the history of the city of Medford, it's in that book, Lock, Stock, and Barrel.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9543.86s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9545.001s">I'd</a> like to ask you a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9546.822s">It's</a> obvious that you put an awful lot of time into it, and you're very positive as it relates to public access and stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9554.926s">But</a> something came across my desk, and I don't know if it's true or false. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9557.267s">I</a> don't know if anyone's aware of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9558.908s">I</a> think it's of the city of Detroit, I could be wrong, or if it's a city in California, but one of those two, where the community had brought an action, a class action, against the administrator of the city for not having public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9572.474s">Have</a> you heard about that?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9603.367s">If</a> I remember correctly, and this is way before you, Joe, this is taxing. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9608.171s">There's</a> nobody on the council that would remember this. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9609.712s">I</a> think it was 1982 or 1983 when we had a city manager form of government and we had signed the contract with Warner Cable, I believe it was Time Warner, whatever the name of the company was back then. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9622.401s">Then</a> city manager, John Galloni, I believe, through Dan Riley, this is taxing my mind, Dan Riley, he was a city solicitor at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9634.453s">A</a> lack of better words, either challenged Time Warner or demanded from Time Warner because they lacked, I believe, the broadcasting, the clarity in the broadcasting. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9646.397s">There</a> was an issue regarding, I believe, public access or city access here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9651.579s">There</a> were four things that they went after at that point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9654.079s">And</a> they responded. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9655.84s">And</a> I couldn't help but think, and I came across this the other day, and I should have brought the paper with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9660.421s">It</a> was a memo that was sent out at that point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9663.573s">What</a> a difference back then, and this was in the early years of when cable was in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9668.435s">I</a> think there was no more than a year, year and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9670.576s">The</a> black and white shows were kind of like fuzzy and a whole bunch of other things that they put in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9676.058s">So</a> different then as compared to what it is right now, how this city administration is handling the concerns of not only cable television, public access, but you have Comcast and you have Verizon here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9687.502s">And</a> both of those stations that are supposed to be delivering <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9691.426s">community</a> access, public access, are charging people each and every week, each and every month on their bills, and they're getting nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9697.69s">We</a> have in excess of over $303,000, according to the city coffers, that the city is sitting on. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9703.714s">So</a> right now, I believe the contract terminates in April of next year, 2015? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9709.317s">April</a> 20th. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9710.217s">April</a> 20th, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9712.099s">And</a> the way the contract was written in the last time, within six months prior to the ending of the contract, <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9718.994s">public</a> hearing needs to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9720.475s">Now,</a> I'm not aware of any public hearing taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9723.077s">We've</a> gotten no information regarding a public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9726.118s">We,</a> there's a gentleman by the name, I think his name was Peter Epstein. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9728.86s">He</a> gets paid $325 an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9731.142s">He</a> comes from the city of Newton. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9732.262s">He's</a> the city's legal representative for cable access. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9736.285s">Absolutely</a> nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9737.706s">I</a> put a call in once and I will, I will put another call in, but I just really think if the mayor of this community does not want to have public access, he needs to return the money and end it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9748.255s">instead</a> of having this facade take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9751.276s">We've</a> gone through two experiments, so to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9754.398s">One</a> with a former Judge Jackson, we spent almost $15,000, where a report was written. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9758.94s">And</a> then most recently, as of this past year, with three community members sitting together for three and a half, four months, and they put together a report for which the mayor said he would be reviewing that or getting into the gut of that after July 4th, and this is now November. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9771.986s">So</a> it's obvious that something is going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9774.507s">The</a> city just doesn't want to participate <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9777.767s">Maybe</a> the mayor just thinks he can take that money and use it, and maybe he can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9780.748s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9781.628s">But,</a> Councilman Marks, you made a remark two weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9784.649s">Maybe</a> it's about time that we bring a class action suit in behalf of the ratepayers of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9790.331s">I</a> want to check in. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9791.071s">You</a> said it was Detroit? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9792.852s">Detroit</a> was another one.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9797.533s">Over</a> access. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9798.254s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9801.194s">I</a> want to see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9801.795s">You</a> said Philadelphia and Detroit. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9803.668s">Philadelphia</a> and California are the class action suits.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9806.209s">If</a> that's the case, and I think if there are enough, 10 people out there who are rate payers within this community who are willing to go forward, I think we need to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9814.833s">This</a> is crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9815.914s">You</a> keep coming here each and every week. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9817.434s">We</a> talk amongst ourselves, we take these votes and the mayor is doing nothing about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9821.596s">So</a> if he's not going to do anything about it, maybe Councilor Marks, you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9824.477s">Maybe</a> we just need to take this upon ourselves, you know, file a class action suit and let's just see where we're going with this because <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9831.356s">This</a> can't keep going. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9832.217s">You</a> can't keep doing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9833.598s">You</a> can't keep charging the ratepayers and giving them nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9836.82s">This</a> isn't like only three or four or five or six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9839.002s">This</a> goes back to December of 2012. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9840.183s">This</a> is not making any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9844.026s">So</a> I thank you for bringing forward that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9845.767s">But</a> I knew there was something out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9848.309s">But</a> now you're saying the mayor sues the council, and then we have one where the council sues the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9852.512s">In</a> Detroit.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9865.915s">Well,</a> we have something, I believe, on our agenda at the very end that goes back to July of last year, waiting for Mr. Rumley to give us an update, because I believe at that point in time, he gave us a full document of what Channel 3 and its corporate offices were all about, what they were supposed to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9881.367s">They</a> were supposed to file the appropriate papers with the, I believe, the Attorney General's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9884.709s">I</a> don't know about the Secretary of State, but I know the Attorney General. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9888.112s">So</a> maybe we should get an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9889.594s">Maybe</a> we should get an update, Mr. Clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9891.394s">Maybe</a> we should get an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9892.395s">Have</a> Mr. Rumley present himself before the council as it relates to just where does the city stand on its lawsuit and where does the city stand on renewing the contract?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9915.341s">Records.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9915.501s">Records.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9915.681s">You</a> can take a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9916.921s">Take</a> a vote on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9920.667s">No,</a> I have a motion on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9924.488s">You're</a> not listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9925.308s">To</a> have the city solicitor report back to the council since July of this past year, what further information he has or what further has the city progressed? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9936.451s">And</a> second of all, what is our standing relative to the cable contract, which comes up April 20th? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9943.793s">What</a> are we doing?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10038.01s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10038.69s">We</a> had made a request a couple of weeks ago as it relates to the Curtis tough school. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10043.933s">We'd</a> asked for a response to come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10046.214s">We</a> never got the response back, but what we did get was a newspaper story. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10050.236s">Once</a> again, this council has to read things in the newspaper. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10053.838s">And</a> unfortunately, um, Councilor Marks, I believe for the last two to three budgetary cycles had been asking about the Curtis tough school, what's going on over there and some of the concerns that were taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10066.723s">And</a> then we read in the news article, nicely written, that superintendent of schools said that he has noticed in recent years that there has been a program leveling off. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10079.368s">And</a> it also indicates that we began to think that the Curtis had developed such a regiment that it really wasn't adapting particularly well to the change in the students' needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10089.333s">We</a> began to feel in the last several years we were not getting the kind of mix and coherence between the program <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10095.489s">and</a> the people coming down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10097.29s">Now,</a> when you say, between the last several years, and Councilman Knox has been asking, and it's been brought up during our budgetary process, what's going on? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10106.515s">All</a> we were getting for a report back was, well, we're working on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10110.358s">There's</a> some problems, and they're addressing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10114.32s">And</a> then they hired an outside consultant in 2013 called the Walker Partnership Company. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10121.324s">And</a> their report included 14 recommendations to correct the problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10125.648s">of</a> high absenteeism, lack of administrative oversight, and other predominant issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10131.912s">But</a> the big shakeup came during the summer for which this council was never apprised of. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10137.376s">It</a> was never apprised during the budgetary process in June and in July when they went forward and they replaced Mr. Volpe as the headmaster at that particular school. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10148.943s">And</a> they replaced him with a gentleman by the name of Mr. Toomey. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10153.746s">Now</a> the question is, <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10156.573s">You're</a> paying for one principal to be over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10160.875s">But</a> you found another job up at the high school for Mr. Volpe. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10169.058s">And</a> that's what we asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10170.798s">What</a> is this job? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10172.399s">What's</a> he getting paid? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10174.06s">And</a> what's the pay of the gentleman that now took over his job at the school? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10180.082s">This</a> doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10183.443s">make</a> some changes, and you know that the council had an interest in it, and it's part of our budget responsibility when we vote on the school department side, it should have been forthcoming. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10192.67s">We</a> shouldn't have to once again read something in the newspaper. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10195.712s">And</a> I commend you again for doing a great job, Alex, for writing the story. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10200.275s">But</a> Alex isn't the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10201.916s">He's</a> a news reporter. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10204.157s">We</a> make resolutions and ask for responses, and every time we either ask for a response or want to know what's going on, you have to read the newspaper. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10213.375s">This</a> administration, on both sides of the street, is just completely ignorant to the fact that there needs to be a cooperation, there needs to be a conversation, there needs to be some sense that what's going on makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10228.025s">Not</a> just makes sense for him, the mayor, it makes sense for the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10232.247s">Perfect</a> example, you just got through voting tonight for in excess of a million three hundred thousand. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10237.051s">Not</a> one council, I'll speak for myself, I don't think any one council was asked <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10241.03s">for</a> any particular pet project they might have that could have been included in there.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10279.348s">And</a> to be further clear about it, Councilor Knight, I'm glad you brought it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10281.708s">Look</a> at the length of time before this action was taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10284.689s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10285.96s">Some</a> of these issues have been years in the making, never mind weeks or months. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10289.542s">But</a> I just think it's kind of like interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10292.424s">And</a> once again, Mr. Clark, you have the res—I'm going to move the resolution again, that we get a report back as to Mr. Brian Toomey, who's the new principal at the Curtis Tufts School, what's his pay? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10305.413s">And</a> also, Mr. Volpe, who's up at the high school, what's his job and what's his pay? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10312.161s">This</a> is all municipal. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10313.462s">It's</a> all municipal business. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10315.123s">And</a> this is something that the council has been asking about for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10318.465s">You've</a> been asking council Max for years on this.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10327.11s">Roll</a> call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10327.751s">Mr.</a> President, what's the matter before us and what is the actual resolution? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10332.533s">The</a> resolution is to have, what is Mr. Brian to be the new minister, the new principal at the Tufts Curtis school? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10339.238s">What's</a> the salary? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10340.425s">And</a> Mr. Volpe, who's there no longer, who's up at the high school, what's his job and what's his salary? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10344.906s">Isn't</a> this the same resolution we just sent forward a couple weeks ago? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10347.767s">We</a> never got an answer, did we?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10355.548s">You</a> can refer it to the school committee if you want.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_gTjmRR2WUVY/2025-03-21_gTjmRR2WUVY.html">Medford City Council - October 28, 2014</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=673.685s">I'd</a> like to ask the gentleman to come back up. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=680.982s">You</a> indicated that there was — the noise was a disturbance?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=724.3s">My</a> question, I guess it runs along that with Councilor Langel-Curran relative to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=730.3s">the</a> 10 days being undetermined, but more importantly, um, this idea of being open from 11 at night to seven in the morning, which would allow them to have a 24 hour operation for up to 10 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=744.126s">Is</a> that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=745.647s">So</a> could we put it also further stipulation that no deliveries take place during that period of time? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=750.889s">If</a> this is just for shopping and shopping alone, then I'm okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=754.991s">But</a> if deliveries are going to be an issue and if that's an issue, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=758.435s">If</a> I'm understanding you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=789.092s">No,</a> between the hours of 11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=790.973s">and</a> 7 a.m.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1024.02s">Mr.</a> President, I, I'm not satisfied over the fact that we're going to give this thing out in finitum because this is the first tryout. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1030.663s">Um,</a> regardless whether it's cold or anyone else, if you give it to them, it's going to set a precedent for any other type of store within the city of Medford department store or what have you claiming that the Christmas season, you know, it's going to be helpful to their business. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1044.768s">I've</a> got no problem and allowing it to go through for the first year and on an annual basis has just come back because if everything works out satisfactory, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1051.684s">there</a> should be no problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1052.885s">But</a> we're setting a precedent here to allow one department store, large as it might be, taxpayer as they might be, but there are a lot of small business folks here in the city of Medford, and they're taxpayers too, and they should be looked upon equally. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1068.197s">And</a> I just think we're setting a precedent here that we're not gonna be able to offset because if Coles gets it, three or four other people or five or six, no matter what part of the city they might be in, might be just coming down here. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1081.801s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1082.442s">You</a> can go to Wellington Circle. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1083.562s">You</a> can go to the new mall down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1086.484s">And</a> I can see them wanting to operate and open during that period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1090.686s">Restaurants</a> to accommodate businesses that are going to be open during that period of time to satisfy people. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1096.45s">I've</a> got no problem in having a designated amount of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1099.512s">I</a> have no problem allowing it for this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1101.553s">I</a> have no problem in giving the extended hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1103.794s">But</a> I am not in favor of making this a rule in perpetuity, to be honest with you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1129.254s">Well,</a> whether it's 90 days, or one day, or a year from now, the management of coals could be entirely different. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1136.439s">Issues</a> could take place after the 90 days that could present a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1140.966s">I</a> just — listen, I've got no problem with it, but I just can't — to me, 90 days means nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1144.93s">I</a> just think they should come in on an annual basis on a case-by-case. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1148.153s">Because</a> if we grant it for one, it's going to be very hard for us to be argued of being arbitrary and capricious and not allowing it to go to somebody else.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1464.304s">Some</a> of the amendments I'm okay with, but I'm still concerned over the fact that you're going to review it in 90 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1471.828s">I</a> think if I was a proprietor in the Meadow Glen Mall right now, and I knew that they could be open during those particular hours, I think I'd be coming here next and just saying, well, I'd like to be open, because you just gave it to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1484.055s">And</a> if I was a food establishment in the Meadow Glen Mall as they are, I think they're going to come in here, and they're going to want extended hours to accommodate the people who are going to be possibly shopping all night long. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1494.902s">And</a> then if you go to Stations Landing, and if you want to go over there, and if those stores want to be open, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1500.751s">I've</a> got no problem with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1502.011s">I</a> don't understand why you just have to give it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1505.132s">Why</a> can't we just give it out for this first year and see where this goes? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1508.053s">See</a> how many other people want to apply for this 24—I mean, they're trailblazing right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1513.015s">They're</a> setting the trademark as to what they want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1515.676s">And</a> let's just see how many other people come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1517.836s">It'd</a> be a shame to have somebody come in here and want to have the exact same thing, and they get shot down because, quote-unquote, either the neighbors or someone, you know, want to object to it because they don't want to be disturbed during those particular hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1531.629s">You</a> can put all the amendments you want onto this thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1533.671s">That's</a> the only thing that bothers me. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1535.212s">You</a> know, I just don't think you should be able to give it out in perpetuity, because if you give it out in perpetuity, and if you bring it back in 90 days, and for whatever the problems, and even if there were problems, and you were going to address them, they still have the thing in perpetuity. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1547.863s">And</a> to get rid of that, as both attorneys know, it's going to be pretty hard, because you haven't specifically laid down rules that could cancel out that rule of perpetuity while they're extended forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1559.577s">I've</a> got no problem voting for it, but I want to amend it that it just become, on an annual basis, a first-time basis, and let's just see where we go with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1567.743s">It's</a> as simple as that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1582.594s">Aye.</a>

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1665.659s">Because</a> this is the first time this is appearing before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1668.801s">And</a> I think being for the first time, let's just see how it goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1672.482s">I'm</a> not about to give away the store on the very first time somebody comes here and then have another person come and get denied because maybe they just don't cut the same—it's not cut the same way, whether it's their neighbors, whether it's the neighborhood, whether it's the location or what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1687.912s">I</a> can just see other people wanting to have the same issue, have the same argument, and I've got no problem with that, and I think we should address them one at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1697.072s">Give</a> it to them for the first year, I've got no problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1699.174s">Even</a> if you want to review it after 90 days, cut it to five, call the police chief, chief of police. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1703.578s">And</a> if everything works out great, and the gentleman in the back there, they have no problems, they come back again next year, it shouldn't present a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1710.163s">But</a> what are we going to do in the meantime? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1711.945s">I</a> ask all of you, if company X comes in now, and they want the same thing, what are we going to do?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1819.028s">This</a> is... But they've closed at 11 because of the business.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1993.355s">I'd</a> like to amend it one step further and have a report back from our city solicitor as it relates to if we are going to give this as an indefinite license for a period of time, that the city solicitor report back to the council under what conditions can the city council terminate? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2013.879s">It's</a> different than giving the license from 11 at night to seven in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2017.96s">You're</a> giving something indefinite. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2020.042s">And</a> I believe that this case law, as Councilor Bruese and the gentleman behind him is aware of, this case law that substantiates the fact you just cannot pull a license just because you're granted it because you feel something went wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2031.571s">It</a> has to be of substance. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2033.592s">And</a> we don't have any of that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2036.094s">This</a> is the first time we're doing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2038.036s">We're</a> basically at a loss to even know what rights do we have, if anything, because you're giving the license. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2044.04s">The</a> license is predicated on two particular issues, number one, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2047.694s">number</a> one, the indefinite period of time, and number two, the hours of operation, making it 24 hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2052.457s">Cancelling</a> out to 24 hours could be within the purview of the Council, but to eliminate the indefiniteness, I think that needs to be reviewed.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2076.096s">It's</a> a license to extend the hours for 24 hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2078.557s">It's</a> a special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2079.517s">Permit.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2079.778s">It's</a> a special permit under zoning law. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2082.079s">Excuse</a> me, you're speaking from the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2083.659s">I'm</a> speaking, and I'm setting the facts straight. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2085.44s">You're</a> not setting the facts straight, because there's two issues here. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2088.022s">The</a> other part of the issue is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2089.843s">You're</a> giving the special permit an additional- Special permit, not a license. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2093.985s">You're</a> giving them an additional privilege, and that is granting it to the licensee for an indefinite period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2101.076s">It's</a> not a permit Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2102.377s">It's</a> not the same as giving the license. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2104.718s">I</a> mean the extended hours, the extended hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2107.62s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2108.44s">There</a> are two separate issues.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2220.543s">It</a> would only be relative to the extended of hours from 11 to 7. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2223.866s">I</a> think what Councilor Marks is alluding to is the second part of this extended hours, it's a request to be indefinite. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2231.472s">Councilor</a> Abuzi, let me ask you a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2234.634s">Maybe</a> we're looking at this thing, we should be looking at this in two separate ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2238.877s">Coming</a> in and asking for the extended hours is one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2241.379s">Maybe</a> the petition should be separate and broken down to have a second one to have it become indefinite. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2247.452s">Yeah,</a> well, you've been here numerous times.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2251.695s">You've</a> been here numerous times. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2252.796s">You</a> have never made a request to have any one of your petitioners be indefinite. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2256.639s">This</a> is the first time.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2262.243s">No,</a> it isn't.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2263.604s">No,</a> it isn't.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2264.845s">On</a> an annual basis, Mr. Clerk, don't they have to renew their application with you?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2310.571s">So</a> it's not going to be indefinite unless Coles, you know, they stay 50 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2316.055s">Can</a> the clerk read, can the clerk please read back with council Max, what's the inclusion going to be as the amendment?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2491.681s">My</a> only concern with that would be if in fact the city solicitor were to come back and indicate that the extended hours does not represent the same intent of making the thing indefinite or indefinite to the extended hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2503.243s">I</a> would be more amenable to going back to your resolution relative to the fact that language be included as part of this, um, that, um, this be reviewed on an annual basis as it relates to the being indefinite. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2516.778s">First</a> year is 90 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2517.899s">Then</a> after that, you really have nothing after the first year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2521.16s">So</a> I think it would be beneficial. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2523.261s">I</a> mean, Councilor Bruese may not be here the next time. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2525.723s">They</a> may have new management folks at Coles. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2528.784s">And</a> there may be problems that could have taken place during the course of the year after the 90 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2533.207s">I</a> don't know, because none of us know. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2534.748s">We</a> can't predict the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2536.589s">Once</a> again, I'm only concerned about the license going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2541.611s">I</a> mean, this indefinite period of time <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2545.465s">and</a> having another petition to come before us.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2740.172s">The</a> police officer for Black Friday, I believe the police officer is for the eight days.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2746.276s">Why?</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2787.204s">So</a> what's your problem with having a police officer? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2790.687s">Expense.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2794.942s">It's-</a> So you're going to guarantee from 11 at night to 7 in the morning, without having a Method police officer there, that nothing's going to take place in that storage- No, I'm not going to guarantee anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2805.831s">Is</a> that what you're saying?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3826.422s">Before</a> you do that, I believe it's important that you read the last paragraph. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3830.486s">That's</a> a state law necessity. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3832.307s">Starting</a> with?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3837.346s">Yeah,</a> before.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4063.087s">Mr.</a> President, I know this has come up in a few times during our annual budget meetings, and I know Councilor Marks has brought this up as it relates to, um, um, let's just say the school in and of itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4074.616s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4075.337s">I</a> got a phone call from a parent, um, as it related to, um, something that was taking place at the school over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4080.861s">And</a> then she indicated, uh, I indicated to her, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4083.525s">Had</a> she spoken to Mr. Volpe, who was the principal, and she says, Mr. Who? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4087.626s">She</a> says, there's no Mr. Volpe. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4088.786s">He's</a> no principal here. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4090.947s">And</a> I says, what are you talking about? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4092.567s">She</a> says, yeah, there's a new person. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4094.468s">There's</a> a different person with a different name. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4097.849s">And</a> then I come to find out, and I think we should get to the bottom of this, because this is part of our budgetary process. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4105.71s">I</a> understand that Mr. Prior Principal of the school is up at the high school with another job getting paid the same amount of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4113.004s">And</a> the question now becomes, when did this all take place? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4117.586s">I</a> believe we were told during our budgetary meetings by the superintendent that there were some concerns, they were going to be addressed, and we would be kept informed. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4125.931s">Well,</a> I don't think anybody, unless anybody in this council knows, that the principal has left, a new one was hired, and he's up at the high school getting the same salary with another job. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4139.184s">I</a> think it's things like this, you know, I think she was more amazed to think that I wasn't aware of what she was trying to tell me. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4145.287s">So,</a> I mean, I don't know if anyone behind here has any information, but I think it would be important, um, and informative if we got a report back. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4151.91s">Um,</a> and I don't know who's going to tell us this, um, why he left and why he's not the principal anymore and why he's up at the high school and who's the new principal of the Tufts Curtis school.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4167.81s">I</a> would say it would be the superintendent, because he must have done the hiring, and it would be nice to know what's the job that he has up at the high school, what's that salary, and what's the job of the lady or the man who's now the principal of the Turtus Cuff, and what's that salary? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4185.871s">It's</a> a confusing little story. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4188.682s">I</a> think amazed at me that I didn't know because I just made an assumption that he was still there as the principal.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4202.031s">Roll</a> call vote has been requested by councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4204.592s">And</a> to have it included Mr. Clerk, the name of the person who is the new principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4210.936s">When</a> was that person hired? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4213.398s">What</a> is the salary? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4214.799s">And</a> the gentleman who was the principal there, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4216.87s">Where</a> is he up at the high school, and what is that salary? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4219.991s">You</a> got it?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4286.044s">Mr.</a> President, we've had this discussion numerous times in the past as it relates to the unfunded liability that the city has been involved in. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4294.046s">And</a> nothing, there's absolutely been no discussion by the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4298.587s">There's</a> been nothing coming forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4300.57s">It's</a> bad enough we've had our discussion relative to the water and sewer account sitting on $8.5 million, and ratepayers are getting no relief. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4308.775s">But</a> we have over $6.5 million in our free cash account, and it would be a good beginning if we started with a $500,000 a year and just moved itself forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4319.28s">You</a> know, if this council wants to leave itself with some type of legacy as it relates to its fiscal responsibility, this would be one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4329.389s">I</a> don't think we should be given anything by the way of the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4332.731s">Well,</a> we're going to come in here and we're going to bond this to get ourselves going. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4336.693s">It</a> doesn't go that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4338.533s">This</a> city, the people in this city have been taxed to death between the state and the feds and the city and everything that's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4348.598s">But</a> if we're sitting on this kind of money and we know we have this debt to pay, we should be upfront about it and start doing it and not leave this for any future city councils. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4358.009s">or</a> any future administration to come in as being a headache. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4362.67s">We</a> get on an annual basis a federal reimbursement from Part D. Last year, we got $335,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4367.911s">We</a> got $335,000 from Part D, which is the Medicare Part D reimbursement. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4370.292s">We</a> were also identified in the state retirees annual review as having an 11.3% <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4389.724s">11.31%</a> return for the last five years on our investments. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4394.907s">But</a> if you look at Malden and if you go to other cities and towns which have a higher rate of return, again, I think it's something that this council has asked for before to maybe to sit down with our retirement board and to go over the type of investments that they have and see where maybe we can streamline and make more and understand why and how other cities and towns <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4417.018s">can</a> do better. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4418.479s">It's</a> not that we're doing that bad, but if somebody can do better, then we should be able to have that ability to look forward as well as that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4425.222s">But</a> I think this is a serious bone of contention. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4428.843s">I</a> think this is something. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4430.444s">This</a> isn't something that maybe we can or can't do. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4433.005s">This</a> is something we have to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4435.206s">This</a> city is obligated to pay its unfunded liability as it relates to its pensions. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4440.929s">It's</a> well into the millions of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4442.47s">This</a> isn't the hundreds of thousands. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4443.93s">It's</a> well into the millions of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4445.958s">And</a> I think if we start nibbling away at it with $500,000 in the first year, setting the example, and each and every year going forward, as we're paying down the at-present cost on an annual basis, it'll greatly reduce the trauma, the fiscal trauma, because that's what it's going to be when the city has to financially realize they've got to pay for this thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4468.817s">I</a> believe it's 2029 is the deadline, 2030 is the deadline. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4474.545s">And</a> we're no closer to having this thing resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4477.086s">And</a> each and every year, as the years go on, this keeps getting itself compounded. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4481.708s">So,</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I spoke to Ann Baker about this, a city auditor, and she believes it's a good — it's a good move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4492.232s">At</a> least we're addressing the subject matter, and that's what we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4496.174s">And</a> let me just, once again, say we shouldn't be leaving this type of a debt for any future council. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4501.996s">And</a> if the administration doesn't want to address it, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4504.607s">Shame</a> on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4505.528s">This</a> is taking a very proactive approach going forward and recognizing this debt has to get paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4511.151s">And</a> to get it paid, knowing that we're flush in our free cash account right now, and it's been an accumulation through the years to get to $6.5 million, I don't think this is going to hurt the city's bank at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4522.897s">And</a> at the same time, we're addressing the subject matter that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4527.439s">So</a> that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to move that by a roll call vote to our city auditor and our finance department. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4535.688s">and</a> get the city on some kind of a system here that addresses this financial liability that it needs to address. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4541.552s">Point</a> of information.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4551.64s">I</a> believe it's in excess of $20 million the city owes. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4555.082s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4556.583s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4557.264s">It's</a> unfunded pension liability.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4848.652s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4849.393s">Mr.</a> President, as I said before, I'm going to disagree with my colleague, Councilor Knight, because the facts that he has are not representative of the cost <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4863.148s">that's</a> presently out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4864.929s">The</a> city of Medford, for example, on a return for its money last year, received 11.96%. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4870.171s">But</a> you go to Northbridge, they had 15.29%. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4872.551s">Norwood,</a> 15.84%. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4872.912s">Peabody</a> had 15.34%. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4873.272s">Pittsfield</a> had 14.91%. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4873.772s">Plymouth</a> had 19.66%. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4874.352s">And</a> then you can go down to these other cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4876.133s">Weymouth</a> had 18.2%. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4892.142s">Winchester</a> had 12 point. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4894.264s">Winthrop</a> had 14 percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4895.664s">Woburn</a> had 18 percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4897.986s">And</a> we can go down, and the question then becomes if our investments aren't meeting or keeping up with those folks, those folks who apparently are doing better than the city of Medford, why? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4911.215s">And</a> maybe we should be looking at taking a lesson from how they do their investments. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4915.698s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4916.438s">Number</a> two, this is a debt obligation that we owe. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4919.299s">And</a> if this city is going to keep worrying about its bond rating, its bond rating has got nothing to do with paying off a debt because you show me the alternative other than taking it out of the money that you already have, other than going out to bond to want to pay for this thing, which would be the most ridiculous way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4937.989s">This</a> city administration is paralyzing, is taking money away from Medford taxpayers <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4944.142s">that</a> either could be used for paying debts such as this or municipal improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4949.245s">This</a> is just two particular areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4951.947s">And</a> if you're going to keep being worried about a bond, well, what's the next big thing to get bonded around here? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4957.41s">The</a> police station? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4958.771s">Well,</a> then let's do it if that's what we're waiting for. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4961.453s">But</a> according to the mayor, that's a seven-year-old process. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4964.795s">This</a> is something that's alive and well. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4967.077s">It's</a> in front of your faces right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4969.278s">This</a> is a debt obligation that's owed because the city, for which has been this administration for 26 years, has never put a dime into paying or paying down on this debt obligation. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4979.327s">And</a> now it's in front of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4980.809s">And</a> it's real. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4981.93s">And</a> it has to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4983.551s">I'm</a> not worried about a bond rating. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4985.493s">I'm</a> more concerned about if we have money sitting in the bank that can start to help to pay this debt down, then that's what we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4994.106s">For</a> God's sakes, you get $8.5 million in a water and sewer account, and the city administration is afraid either to lower the rates or have a program set. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5003.21s">Those</a> are the only two things you can do with a surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5005.831s">And</a> he's being allowed to just get away with doing nothing and letting the money accumulate. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5011.373s">And</a> here you are, $6.5 million in free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5014.334s">But</a> you also have a debt obligation that exists each and every year and continues to grow. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5021.16s">This</a> is not going to go away. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5022.661s">This</a> isn't a political issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5025.062s">This</a> is a real, live, physical debt obligation that this city owes. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5031.444s">And</a> with that being said, $500,000 is a drop in the bucket. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5035.025s">It's</a> a beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5036.426s">It's</a> a beginning to understand that we are going to address this problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5040.768s">And</a> if we're fortunate enough to keep going and having free cash, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5044.815s">then</a> maybe that's the best way to just keep going. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5047.816s">Because</a> I don't know any other way other than going out and, again, banging the taxpayer overhead by way of a bond or some other financial encumbrance that they're going to have to pay for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5057.481s">And</a> they shouldn't have to pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5059.322s">But</a> when other cities and towns, other cities and towns can generate that kind of money by a rate of interest return for their last year, and we did 11 percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5069.106s">We're</a> somewhere in the middle or thereabouts. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5071.127s">But</a> there are other cities and towns well ahead of us with their interest returns. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5074.883s">Then</a> I think we need to have a — sit down with the Retirement Board and Baker and all our financial people. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5080.084s">But</a> that's not the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5081.344s">This</a> issue has got to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5083.425s">And</a> the best way to address it, knowing right now that we're flushing at least one particular account, then let's get to it and let's start on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5090.206s">And</a> let's not worry about, oh, my God, we might go from a triple-A to a double-A bond rating because we used money that the taxpayers have that are generally theirs that's not being used for anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5102.049s">We're</a> waiting for this administration to decide <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5104.536s">the</a> next thing he wants to do to use the money on. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5107.679s">And</a> then maybe when he leaves next year or two years or whenever he decides to go or gets beaten out of office, that administration is going to have to deal with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5117.086s">That</a> city council is going to have to deal with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5119.628s">And</a> then it will affect every single thing that a budget has. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5122.651s">But</a> if there's a commitment that's built in now, and it represents the fact that we're addressing this debt that wasn't started by this council or councils before, it's been sitting there for years, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5134.239s">because</a> no city administration wanted to deal with it, now's the time to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5138.642s">All</a> you have to do is pony up, however you want to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5141.705s">Do</a> you want to have a meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5142.646s">I've</a> got no problem with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5144.087s">But</a> as Councilor De La Rosa, you alluded to it, it should be addressed this term, and the first payment should begin during this legislative session that we're serving in.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5288.334s">Mr.</a> President, to bond 2 percent, maybe you misspoke. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5291.514s">You</a> said maybe we should just go out and bond for 2 percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5294.248s">and</a> that money will generate some money. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5296.79s">Why</a> would you be going out to bond 2% to pay? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5299.312s">When</a> you go out to bond, you're bonding for something. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5303.316s">I</a> think you misspoke. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5304.257s">I</a> don't understand what you said. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5305.277s">You</a> said you bond for 2%?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5320.03s">That's</a> not the investment that's going. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5323.365s">If</a> you look at how the Retirement Board invests its money, and if you read the State Investment Board Retirement Program, it's to pay for the investments that you have right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5332.71s">We're</a> talking about the unfunded liability. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5334.751s">It</a> doesn't make any difference what the Feds or Gatsby or anybody else says. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5338.273s">You're</a> going to have to—and whatever the new accounting practices might be, they still <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5342.527s">can't</a> get you away from the fact that you owe this money. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5345.028s">And</a> however you owe this money, if this money is put aside in a special account to offset it, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5350.432s">We're</a> not putting up $6 or $7 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5352.573s">We're</a> starting at a $500,000 beginning here.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5362.599s">Well,</a> then if that's the case, then maybe we should have <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5364.78s">Maybe</a> the meeting should be the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5368.903s">A,</a> that we have a meeting with the city's retirement board. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5375.027s">Ann</a> Baker, she's our auditor, and I believe she sits on the board anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5379.57s">What</a> is the total amount of the unfunded liability? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5383.112s">The</a> unfunded pension liability, how much is that?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5388.375s">As</a> of today. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5389.356s">As</a> of today. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5390.456s">The</a> unfunded pension liability as of today, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5395.057s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5430.164s">Well,</a> that's Councilor Knight's opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5432.946s">As</a> of right now, let's just see, what is the unfunded liability? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5436.909s">How</a> is that determined? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5438.149s">If</a> you want to use the Gatsby, the new federal, I don't have no idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5440.951s">Let's</a> just see, because they're the ones that have to deal with this on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5444.014s">The</a> unfunded liability, what's the due date that has to be paid out? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5451.029s">And</a> Committee of the Whole?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5505.263s">As</a> amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5506.758s">And</a> also further, can we get a separate report? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5509.74s">What,</a> if any, finances, financial remuneration does the city of Medford get out of the Medicare drug subsidy?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5522.929s">Yeah,</a> we can do that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5545.857s">Eddie,</a> you have that? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5546.397s">Because</a> you look like you had a little.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5556.541s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5556.821s">If</a> we can get that information ahead of time so we can discuss it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6093.151s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6094.472s">Mr.</a> President, whether it means buying the building or renting the space, something needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6101.597s">A</a> few weeks ago, I was led to believe by someone who <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6105.75s">who</a> seems to be in the know in this building, that the mayor was going to be making his decision, and he was going to be making the announcement that public access was going to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6116.319s">I</a> haven't seen it, and it hasn't taken place. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6119.502s">But</a> just to go back with a reminder, Councilman Max, I think it was two budgets ago, because the money was not included in the budget, to put money in there for the arts, if you remember correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6132.687s">And</a> I believe the resolution was a joint resolution between yourself and myself for $10,000 to be put in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6138.973s">And</a> then when the mayor found out about it, and it was right during the middle of an election period of time, he decided to up the ante to $20,000 or $15,000, I forget the final number, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6150.423s">Never</a> saying a word to the council, because the council all voted on that, and I believe the council even voted to amend it to a higher dollar amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6158.594s">never</a> a thank you coming back to the council for at least enlightening him or whatever it might be, but because it was a political process or it was political benefit for him. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6169.561s">The</a> part that I just don't understand right now is this $303,000 sitting downstairs in the general fund of this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6176.124s">That</a> doesn't come from the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6177.925s">It</a> comes from the rate payers for Comcast and Verizon subscribers. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6182.548s">That's</a> their money. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6184.009s">And</a> they are owed public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6186.812s">And</a> that's what that money is for. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6188.893s">Now,</a> for how unfortunately what took place in December of 2012 till now, and there's no more Channel 3, and, you know, that's a hauntedness unto itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6198.92s">There's</a> no records. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6199.74s">There's</a> no books. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6200.881s">There's</a> no validity to what they've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6202.422s">There's</a> no minutes to the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6204.203s">The</a> Attorney General's Office still can't give you an answer as to what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6208.966s">That's</a> a shame. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6210.768s">But</a> that's one part. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6212.028s">And</a> the other part of the coin is no public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6215.153s">And</a> if April 20th is right around the corner, usually before the April 20th, I believe within six months prior to the deadline of the contract, public hearings are supposed to be taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6227.617s">And</a> I believe the city of Medford hires this gentleman from Newton. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6230.898s">I</a> think they pay him $325 an hour as legal counsel and advisor to the city for cable television. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6238.141s">And</a> they usually have these public meetings here at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6241.502s">I</a> think they're required to have one if not two public hearings <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6245.002s">before</a> they're submitted into Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6247.883s">I</a> just don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6249.224s">I</a> guess I'm lost for words right now to you and everyone who might be watching. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6253.405s">I</a> was really hoping that the mayor was going to pull the rabbit out of the hat, and he was finally coming to his senses. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6258.767s">But</a> I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6260.288s">I</a> can't answer it, because it's a real shame. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6263.149s">You</a> know, we have an attorney general candidate from the city of Medford, Martha Coakley. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6268.37s">She</a> has gone to every single public access chase around the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6273.662s">around</a> the city of Medford, but not in her own hometown that she lives in. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6277.826s">And</a> that's a shame. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6278.787s">Whether</a> you're voting for or not voting for, but you can't get any closer to home, to the highest elected office statewide. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6286.694s">And</a> it isn't because there's no money, and it isn't because you're trying to find a place, because I don't see anybody trying to find it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6295.802s">It's</a> a lack of... <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6297.461s">It's</a> a lack of free speech being allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6299.983s">The</a> other night in Winchester, Pat Jalen and Bob Capucci had a debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6305.187s">They</a> had to go to Winchester. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6307.128s">And</a> it's going to be aired back in Somerville, but the city of Medford, you know, they don't have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6311.471s">And</a> these people represent our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6313.973s">Elections</a> are just as important as anything else that goes on public access, whether it's an educational thing, whether it's a sports event, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6322.099s">And,</a> you know, I don't know why the people, when you look at your cable bill each and every month, whatever that dollar is, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6327.335s">or</a> $0.98, or whatever the dollar amount might be, you're just throwing that away. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6331.416s">Because</a> this city administration doesn't want to seem to have cable access. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6336.637s">And</a> like I said, and I apologize for repeating myself, I was led to believe by someone who seems to be pretty good in the know that he was going to do it, but apparently he hasn't done it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6345.918s">So</a> this is two times that this has happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6348.739s">Judge</a> Jackson, when she did her report, so five years ago, she wrote an extensive report. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6353.8s">I</a> think we've all read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6355.01s">And</a> then the most recent cable committee, not commission committee that the mayor had, and he indicated subsequent to Memorial Day and right after the 4th of July, he was going to make his announcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6365.217s">This</a> is now almost November 1st and there's no announcement to be made and people keep paying and keep paying and keep paying. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6371.222s">So,</a> um, I hear what you're saying, Jeannie, and it's just a shame that we don't have public access here in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6377.266s">You</a> know, elections are very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6379.128s">Candidates</a> have an opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6380.809s">They</a> don't have any opportunity in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6383.354s">But</a> you can be rest assured next year, Channel 15 will be proffering everything that the mayor wants to talk about during the election campaign. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6392.16s">You</a> know, it's kind of interesting here, and I'll just ask my colleagues about this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6396.843s">Have</a> any one of you ever tried to have your own press release and try to get a hold of Channel 15 and have them come up and give you the same forum that the mayor gets and use the same people up at the high school getting paid on city time to do a public forum? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6412.895s">Try</a> it and see if it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6415.076s">Try</a> to get an informational piece on the city's webpage and see what happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6420.037s">It</a> doesn't happen and it doesn't exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6422.958s">So</a> this freedom of expression and freedom of what goes on as public officials here in the city is only designed for one person because that person's in control of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6432.261s">And</a> it's very unfortunate. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6433.861s">And</a> I would hope people would wake up and realize that, you know, at the rate we're going and if you keep paying for it, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6440.567s">And</a> this is a very scary thought, and I'll conclude by saying the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6443.869s">I</a> could be corrected, but I think I found this out information today that's correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6447.772s">The</a> mayor does not have to allow public access by right of contract if he so chooses not to renew. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6454.837s">The</a> big question then becomes who and what takes that $300,000 or $500,000 or $400,000, whatever the dollar amount is going to be then. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6464.404s">It's</a> going to be a damn shame if that money winds up into the general coffers <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6468.07s">and</a> never been used for public access, and nobody ever had an opportunity to understand why or how, because nobody spec'd up and nobody challenged it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6477.217s">That's</a> an issue right now, I believe, in a surrounding city and town that's in a legal contest, and if that be the case, you know, we better watch out and better be prepared for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6485.844s">So,</a> with that being said, I thank you for making your remarks, and whether we buy the building, rent the building, or what have you, Gene, or anyone who might be watching, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6494.543s">You</a> know, public access does not exist in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6497.625s">It's</a> not alive and well, and you can thank the mayor of this community because he's not allowing it.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=412.582s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=412.762s">Stein?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=420.552s">You</a> represent the unfortunate part of what happens in society. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=425.193s">Some</a> people don't get involved until it happens to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=427.874s">And</a> unfortunately, it's with you and your dad. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=430.394s">But</a> this is a huge issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=432.995s">And</a> I'm glad you brought it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=434.235s">And</a> I agree with Councilor Lungo-Curran. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=436.935s">These</a> kids go to school, and they're not worried about who's pulling out of a driveway or who might be coming down the street at a record speed. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=443.477s">But</a> if you thought of going to the State Department of Public Safety, and they have a belief <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=451.292s">It's</a> kiddie grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=452.692s">I</a> could be wrong with the name, but I think it's something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=456.033s">And</a> they promote, through financial aid, having somebody maybe even come up to the school and go through sample demonstrations as what to look out for. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=467.256s">You</a> know, you can talk to the kid or the children, but if you demonstrate it right in front of them, you know, it's live and it's real. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=475.538s">And,</a> you know, and I think that could possibly, you know, it's just another avenue to get more exposure, but at the same time, <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=481.037s">increase</a> the liability that you don't really want to have anyone else go through such as yourself, unfortunately. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=488.659s">But</a> it did happen, and I'm glad you're doing what you're doing, and you should be complimented. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=493.76s">But</a> to keep this thing going, and keep it alive, and making a presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=498.181s">I</a> would suggest that you go before the school committee too, and make the same suggestion to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=502.162s">because</a> they have the onus responsibility of making sure those kids get to school correctly.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=509.549s">And</a> this is one of their obligations and their way of representing you, the taxpayers and the children of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=516.694s">So</a> I think you have two viable options to go to, to make your case here and at the same time get some more help.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1278.138s">So</a> that was your question?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1296.648s">From</a> the way I understand it, in reading the addendums that we were given last week, there's anywhere from 2,500 to 2,600 stickers that have already been issued. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1304.971s">And</a> I don't think they've been reissued as of July 1 of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1309.804s">That's</a> a question, I believe, that needs to be answered because nobody's got the answer for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1314.725s">I</a> think she's talking resident permit parking.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1338.984s">but</a> there's two parts of that permit parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1341.005s">One</a> is residential, one is commercial. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1343.046s">So</a> I just didn't know.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2254.761s">Mr.</a> President, I can appreciate both Councilor Marks and Councilor Dello Russo and their issues, but once we take paper 14-701 off the table, <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2264.144s">and</a> talking about the contract, which we were given last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2267.725s">Unfortunately,</a> you weren't here. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2269.165s">You</a> were sick. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2270.665s">I</a> think we can get into, I think we can get into what you're talking about because there's a way to have this not only explained, but there's some issues in here that I don't believe that the council is aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2280.588s">And</a> so I'm glad we did get the contract and after reviewing it, there's some issues we'd like to talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2288.349s">Are</a> we still on the suspension?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2301.174s">And</a> which paper, Councilman? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2303.815s">It's</a> 14701. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2304.716s">It</a> was tabled last week.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2316.462s">To</a> take it off the table.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2319.324s">Aye.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2323.101s">Mr.</a> President, last week we were received because the council had asked for a copy of the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2329.505s">We</a> were given a, a disc copy, which talked about the five addendums to the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2337.291s">Then</a> we were given the hard copy contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2340.434s">Um,</a> and I read the contract twice and then I went back and I read what was given to us on September 10th twice. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2350.881s">And</a> there's only, <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2352.488s">One,</a> one, two. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2353.969s">There's</a> only five words that made a change in the whole contract, under the whole proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2361.453s">And</a> it comes under the procurement of meters, equipment, and vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2366.676s">And</a> at the very end, it basically says the cost of the vehicles and the required accessories, x, x, x, x, x. That was in the September 9th. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2376.901s">In</a> the October 7th, the cost of the vehicles <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2382.132s">is</a> going to be provided by the operator. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2384.213s">That's</a> the only change in language that we have from September 9th through October 7th and what we got. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2393.716s">We</a> were also told and we were given, we did receive as public information provided by the mayor himself that he sent out a press release on October 7th indicating that he had signed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2406.741s">And</a> there was one, two, three, four, there were four inclusions in that recommendation page. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2411.539s">where</a> he indicates after deliberating and discussing concerns raised by the business community, the mayor is recommending the following changes to the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2419.383s">And</a> the four issues that were raised are nowhere, nowhere to be found in the contract, no by reference or otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2426.886s">So</a> the contract proposal as preliminary on September 10th and the final one that was signed by the mayor on October 7th does not have those recommendations that he supposedly <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2440.803s">put</a> in his public press release that, you know, again, it gives a false representation as to what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2448.926s">Also,</a> Mr. President, we got in this disk there — strike that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2453.468s">Let's</a> just go to the contract first. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2455.789s">In</a> the contract, there is some representation — and I don't know how this got by anybody — but there's some representation that says, this contract includes, but is not limited to, the 987 <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2469.928s">metered</a> spaces that exist at the commencement of this agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2474.211s">There</a> is no metered spaces in the city of Medford right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2477.974s">So</a> how do they determine 987 metered spots? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2483.198s">I</a> have absolutely no idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2485.699s">And</a> I think that needs to be explained further. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2488.281s">Also,</a> as you continue on, it should go to, I think, under the rent, under the section rent in the contract, it says years eight, nine, and 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2498.631s">provided</a> the city exercises its option to extend the agreement, as stated herein, operators shall continue to pay the city the guaranteed rent in continuation of paragraph 1A, which is the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2512.242s">So</a> if you're looking and you're reading this, is this a seven-year contract or is this a 10-year contract? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2517.587s">Because</a> 8, 9, and 10 are option years. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2520.089s">And</a> as we all know, under option years, under the law, the city's procurement officer has to demonstrate by giving to the council <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2528.047s">a</a> comparison of not only the figures that we presently have, but the difference between they doing it, X, or the city of Medford doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2537.669s">That</a> is not explained in here, other than the fact that eight, nine, and 10 appears to be option-type years. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2544.291s">So</a> the question is, is this a seven-year contract, or is it a 10-year contract? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2549.072s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2550.933s">These</a> are questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2552.493s">Also,</a> the contract, as you continue on, <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2555.982s">has</a> some questions as it relates to, once again, liability regarding certain issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2561.444s">And</a> the liability questions that present itself, I think, directly go to what Councilman Knox was alluding to in the issues of handicapped accessibility, who's going to be responsible, and the placing and the locations of the handicapped accessibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2580.37s">Also,</a> I believe, as Councilor De La Ruza just alluded to, I don't think it's the responsibility of this council <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2586.263s">to</a> explain anything to anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2587.804s">This</a> is the mayor's proposal.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2607.695s">Well,</a> I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2608.495s">I</a> misunderstood. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2609.396s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2609.816s">I</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2610.276s">I</a> thought you had.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2616.182s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2616.863s">That's</a> in the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2618.184s">I</a> think if you go now to the addendums that were given to us in the video of last week, this is very, very telling. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2625.029s">If</a> you go to addendum number, let's do them one at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2628.972s">From</a> addendum number three, question is the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2638.46s">If</a> the city, wait a minute, excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2641.022s">The</a> question is, how many residential permits are issued annually and what is the cost per permit? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2646.324s">First</a> answer is between 25 to 2,600. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2648.565s">1,000</a> is a huge difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2653.728s">If</a> it was 15, 20, or 100, I think that could be understandable. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2658.25s">How</a> could you have 1,000 and a discrepancy such as that, unless the figures haven't been calculated to be more accurate? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2667.615s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2669.336s">Also,</a> the real big question, and this was one, Jeanne Mutton, <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2673.54s">This</a> was one that was brought up at the meeting over and over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2676.622s">Okay,</a> and it says the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2679.563s">Will</a> all existing parking signage need to be replaced or will existing parking signage be permitted to remain? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2687.887s">The</a> city's answer, existing signage will be permitted to remain. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2692.09s">It</a> is in good condition and reflects all the information necessary for notice of parking restrictions. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2698.853s">Now,</a> show me a parking, <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2703.972s">identification</a> that even talks about kiosks, nevermind the meters, that's existing. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2710.037s">We</a> don't have it because they don't exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2713.039s">And</a> I don't understand how the city can go forward and make that kind of a thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2716.922s">It</a> reflects all the information necessary for notice of parking restrictions. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2722.887s">I</a> just don't understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2724.768s">Then</a> you go a little bit step further when from addendum number two, <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2729.794s">It</a> says, who is responsible for the upkeep of the municipal lots including sweeping, cleaning, snow plowing, pothole, maintenance, lighting, and re-striping if necessary? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2744.165s">City's</a> answer, the city will continue to maintain the municipal lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2748.89s">My</a> question is this, when it snows, and we've seen it on numerous occasions, and some of those sidewalks are inundated with mounds and mounds of snow, is the city going to be responsible to go out there and shovel out the kiosks? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2764.557s">Are</a> you going to tell the business people that you've got to go out and shovel out the kiosks? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2771.7s">I</a> don't understand why nobody had the idea to think into this and to get to that point, because that is going to be an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2777.541s">When</a> there's a serious snowstorm in this city, it's bad enough that the city has to go out there with their plows and do what's necessary to make sure that the streets are open for public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2785.808s">But</a> when you're dealing with kiosks throughout the city, and you have almost 1,700, 1,800 of these that are going to represent parking spaces for, I don't know, how many kiosks that they're going to have, who's going to be responsible? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2797.619s">City?</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2806.901s">I</a> didn't finish, you know, let me finish.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2809.761s">No,</a> the 1,700 spots for which 85, allegedly 85 to 89 kiosks are going to be managing those 85, those 85 kiosks will be managing the 1,700 or 1,800 spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2824.785s">Get</a> it? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2825.445s">On</a> the street? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2826.185s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2838.444s">Well,</a> then you know something, the numbers, there's something wrong with these numbers then.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2866.573s">Well,</a> we were asked to review this council Dello Russo last week, and that's what I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2870.835s">The</a> next question is, does the city have any other studies that provide projected revenues for paid parking? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2877.077s">And</a> if so, the city, please provide the studies. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2879.959s">And</a> the answer is the city does not have any other studies. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2883.16s">This</a> council asked to have its own independent study and all we were told <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2887.985s">It</a> would be more expensive than that, because we got that as part of, quote, a confidential piece of paper that we weren't supposed to disclose to anyone that had nothing that verified that the facts that they were presenting were right. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2901.391s">Also,</a> in the RFP that went out, the question was asked of them if, in fact, they would submit or produce two references <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2915.622s">And</a> two references that were the closest to the city of Medford for which this company, this company, Republic from Tennessee worked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2923.648s">And</a> that's no way that I don't know where it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2925.99s">It</a> may be in city hall someplace, but it would have been nice for the council to have had that as backup to the fact that if mayor thinks this is such a great company and it's just a wonderful job, these are the two backups that were asked for and that were acknowledged. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2939.801s">Also,</a> I think that what needs to needs to be understood is <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2946.56s">Last</a> week we were also told, strike that, two weeks we were also told when the President of the Chamber of Commerce were here that the Chamber, Government Affairs Committee, and the Chamber's Board of Directors presented to the Mayor that they were in favor of this pay-to-park program. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2964.426s">The</a> letter dated September 26, 2014, by the President, Mr. White, in a four-page, five-page, I mean, five-paragraph, doesn't indicate that at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2974.629s">It</a> indicates <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2976.285s">of</a> their interest in it, but it indicates very clearly. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2979.506s">We</a> also recognize that from business center to business center, our members have different parking needs and varying concerns with the enforcement plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2989.29s">We</a> would like to provide a forum for our members to voice their concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=2993.112s">It</a> is important that the chamber be involved with any additional planning or public meetings in distributing such information so that we can serve our members appropriately. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3002.756s">That</a> letter is not an endorsement of a pay-to-park program.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3020.155s">My</a> answer to that is the letter that was sent to the administration by Mr. White, Mr. Call, and Janet Donnelly never was presented to the entire membership. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3031.142s">And</a> this was presented on September 26th. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3034.003s">So,</a> as Mr. White indicated when he was at that forum, <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3037.634s">that</a> the Government Affairs Committee and the Board of Directors endorsed the pay-to-park program. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3041.975s">The</a> pay-to-park program wasn't even signed. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3044.356s">So</a> that's number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3045.417s">Number</a> two, it's quite obvious that this coincides to the commentary that was represented in the Medford transcript that the business community and the business squares are concerned and they have varying indifference of opinions. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3058.941s">Now,</a> you can agree or disagree with what's going on because the commentary subsequent to that, which was issued on October 7th by the mayor of this community, <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3068.053s">says</a> he met with the chamber, and they agreed, and they come up with these four recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3072.574s">These</a> aren't four inclusions in the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3074.815s">These</a> are only recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3076.936s">And</a> if they're only recommendations, and they're not going to be effective, because the council, strike that, because the contract in and of itself says, that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3083.818s">This</a> is the final terminology. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3086.919s">I</a> don't know how a recommendation can come into play, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3090.68s">And</a> number two, if it's not included in the contract, and not even incorporated by reference, that's number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3098.285s">It</a> doesn't even talk about how many people even bid for the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3102.027s">Speaking</a> with folks who are professional in public bidding contracts here in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, we were led to believe in our executive session on May 20th that we had to choose this one particular individual, because that's what the mayor was recommending at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3119.454s">But</a> we had three legitimate people. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3122.753s">who</a> had submitted to the RFP. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3125.675s">We</a> never got those figures from the three people in their bidding process to make an intelligent decision to make the final decision or make the decision who we're going to take.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3156.177s">I'm</a> going to respectfully disagree with my colleagues because the meeting did take place with the fact that we were going to be informed as to where we were going on the RFP. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3164.201s">Uh,</a> Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3165.001s">Louise</a> Miller was there and unfortunately she didn't have an opportunity to speak why they didn't let her speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3169.684s">But</a> there were three people who submitted bids. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3171.745s">The</a> mayor decided to choose only one. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3173.686s">The</a> mayor's request to the council was at that point in time, do we go forward with this one? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3177.387s">I</a> needed your opinion on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3178.808s">So</a> none of us had any of an opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3181.372s">any</a> opportunity to even understand who the other two people were if they were legitimate because they satisfied the RFP that the city sent out. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3188.576s">You</a> know, if this is going to be an open and transparent process, and we're supposed to get the biggest bang for our buck, who knows that maybe one of the other two that wasn't chosen or didn't submit couldn't have given a better deal, or at least offered something for some of us to say, well, wait a minute, let's take a comparison. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3206.644s">That</a> for which we never even had the opportunity, didn't even have the opportunity, <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3210.27s">to</a> getting one from the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3211.911s">You</a> know, how do you turn around and hand someone on October 7th to the council, the contract that was signed, have a press release go out that day, which is exactly the same thing that was given to us on September 10th, minusing out five words, but identifies allegedly metered spots in the city that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3234.591s">There</a> is not one metered spot in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3238.373s">And</a> that would be crucial to this contract, because if it's a meted spot, it needs to be identified. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3244.679s">And</a> having no meted spots to be identified tells me, or at least reads it, I'm not the lawyer, we have lawyers on the council here, that basically would tell you if it's an unidentifiable location as stated in here to be identified, <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3262.444s">Well,</a> that presents a difference of opinion as to what are we signing in for and what are we getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3268.608s">But</a> more importantly, the fact of kiosks, snow, responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3273.872s">Is</a> it 987? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3274.592s">Is</a> it 2,600 or 2,500 permanent parking stickers? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3281.117s">How</a> many actually is it going to be? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3282.938s">Who's</a> going to maintain the parking lot? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3284.179s">For</a> example, the parking lot up on Boston Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3286.86s">90%</a> of that parking lot, even though the city has its signs, is privately owned. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3291.07s">So</a> what are they going to do with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3292.631s">Put</a> kiosks on somebody's privately-owned property? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3296.453s">I</a> got calls this week from folks who want to know, who are business people, and I won't mention their names, who's exempt and who isn't exempt, because there are a lot of commercial pieces of property in this city that people are going to want to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3310.761s">Who?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3310.861s">Who?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3310.961s">Who?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3311.101s">Who?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3311.862s">Who?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3311.982s">Who?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3312.062s">Who?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3312.142s">Who?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3312.222s">Who?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3312.302s">Who?</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3342.12s">But</a> to get them meted, they need to be identified. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3345.463s">This</a> contract says they are already identified. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3349.333s">They're</a> not identified. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3350.313s">We</a> do not have one metered spot here in the city of Medford.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3363.298s">Then</a> maybe the terminology should have been changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3365.178s">Instead</a> of metered spots, identified spots, identifiable spots as city of Medford spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3370.46s">You</a> know, contracts are usually very specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3373.061s">And</a> it's going to be very specific because they're going to be basing their money and their profit on a lot of the specifics that are in this contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3379.998s">And</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I just really think that, especially with that press release that went out by the mail last week, I mean, none of us can answer the question because, you know, it can't be fact if it can't be found in the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3394.769s">And</a> even by reference, anything subsequent to that could be written. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3398.691s">Sure,</a> it does say in here that the traffic commission will be the group of individuals who's going to set the fees and do whatever it has to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3407.912s">and</a> that the city administration basically is going to be the reviewing authority for appeals, and they're not going to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3413.774s">And</a> it talks about trying to employ 50% Medford people to be part of the program and blah, blah, blah, and all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3420.137s">But</a> there were certain specifics in here that are just left out there, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3424.679s">And</a> maybe it would have been nice if we got all of this information before anything was signed so we could have a full-blown discussion, and taxpayers and ratepayers and business folks throughout the entire community would have had an opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3436.996s">You</a> know, this has been hanging around since 2009, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3440.177s">This</a> was a quick rush from September 9th to October 7th. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3444.498s">And</a> that's kind of like, you really question, what was the quick rush since you've been waiting five years to discuss this? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3450.66s">Even</a> if it took another four or five or six months, who cares? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3453.2s">Eventually,</a> we know it's going to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3454.381s">Because</a> this council asked for traffic enforcement, not revenue enhancement, traffic enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3461.142s">And</a> there is a big difference.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3510.176s">Just</a> a response back to Councilor Langel-Curran. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3514.897s">You</a> know, we never engaged in a revenue enhancement program to find out just how much money that could bring in. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3521.962s">And</a> now once folks out-of-towners realize that they're not going to be able to stay here and park here all day long, that money that you think you would be getting and generating from those folks, that's not going to exist because they're not going to come here anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3535.232s">So</a> you're basically dealing with your in-town and maybe every now and then out-of-town. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3540.055s">But</a> when you think of what's going on, your water bill, <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3544.459s">It</a> just goes up. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3545.52s">Your</a> food tax, your gasoline tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3548.103s">And</a> now, this past week, if you all read the newspapers and understood that the electric company will be raising your electric rates 37% this winter for heat, for whatever that's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3560.835s">How</a> much more can you keep banging away and telling the taxpayer, you gotta pay for more and more and more? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3567.227s">If</a> we had a very simple program that recognized, let's start off slow. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3571.913s">Let's</a> start with an enforcement program. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3573.695s">I</a> don't think, let me just cut this. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3575.057s">I</a> don't think anybody would argue the fact that if you want to put meters a kiosk and parking lots, that isn't it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3579.842s">It's</a> the on street parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3581.604s">And</a> that's the issue that's presenting itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3583.747s">And</a> because of that, <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3586.074s">You</a> have to realize all these other taxes and these fees that people are paying, it's just going to end. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3591.256s">It's</a> almost like looking at some of the questions that are on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3594.597s">You</a> know, they want to force you into a forced deposit on certain bottles, and every five years it'll just go up automatically. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3601.339s">I</a> mean, how much are you going to keep telling the people you're going to have to pay for something with no question? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3605.92s">Same</a> thing with the gas tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3607.28s">You're</a> not going to be able to question it because it's just going to be automatic. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3610.421s">People</a> have a right to discuss these issues and to know <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3613.271s">how</a> they have been determined. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3614.592s">That's</a> why we're the legislative body here. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3616.894s">And</a> that's why we have, and we should have had that right to make the vote, not the vote that was okay in May to make the mayor go out and negotiate, but the council should have had that final vote to say whether we're on board or not on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3630.585s">That's</a> where the mayor, I believe you served his authority, went forward and he took that May 20th vote as for him to go forward and do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3637.871s">And</a> that was not my intention for vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3640.053s">And</a> it was as clear as a bell. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3641.414s">If</a> you watch them, <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3642.287s">the</a> minutes of the meeting of May 20th and as recorded in the minutes as well.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3660.352s">On</a> the trash contract, Mr. President, with due respect, the trash contract can be signed <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3664.423s">by</a> the executive authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3665.443s">You</a> didn't need the legislative body for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3667.064s">It's</a> one of the very rare contracts that can be signed like that.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4192.999s">Well,</a> I guess what appears to be now really preposterous. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4195.32s">I</a> never thought of it until you just said it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4197.341s">The</a> chamber, who allegedly had so much input into this thing, didn't even get an ounce of recognition for being part and parcel of a new program that was going to be taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4207.906s">I</a> guarantee you there wasn't even a mention about the Craddock Bridge.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4212.328s">Well,</a> I guarantee you, because from people that were there, there was no mention of the Craddock Bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4215.429s">I</a> wasn't there.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4216.249s">You</a> know, that's the sad part about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4217.75s">If</a> we're going to be talking about businesses in this city and how they're going to be affected and <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4222.573s">and</a> the people that are supposed to be representing them, and the leaders of those businesses, and nothing takes place that said, where are we going with all of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4231.538s">You</a> can have all the meetings you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4232.638s">You</a> can tell the mayor to do this and that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4234.079s">He</a> signed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4234.939s">This</a> is the mayor's plan, lock, stock, and barrel. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4237.38s">Whether</a> the council agreed in part or in total or 100 or 90, that's not the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4242.043s">This</a> all started off as a small little revenue, strike that, a small little enforcement, an enforcement appetite to possibly <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4250.58s">get</a> the people back on track. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4252.921s">Possibly,</a> and I think it was you, Councilor Camuso, who asked the question, maybe the people coming and parking on Placeda Road from Winchester, can we charge out-of-towners more than can we charge in-towners? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4262.664s">And</a> we waited to get an answer on that, and that would have been a great help if we could do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4266.124s">No,</a> but that would be a great help if we could do it with a great disparity in the cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4270.546s">Maybe</a> charge someone $500, $600 to park in Medford, rather than a Medford resident parking even the $100, and that's a bargain, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4278.824s">So</a> you can go to all these little side streets and talk to the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4282.086s">They'll</a> tell you. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4282.866s">They</a> have all these cars parked in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4284.327s">They</a> see people go and take the train. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4286.508s">Who</a> goes and takes the bus? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4289.949s">If</a> you don't have resident parking, it's still not going to work, because people are going to be still parking in those particular neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4297.233s">The</a> mayor can send out all the press releases he wants. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4300.234s">Contractor</a> doesn't have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4301.755s">Kiosks,</a> what's your issues and concerns?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4546.169s">I'm</a> going to put my resolve on there too, my commentaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4549.098s">Number</a> one, I want to know who's going to be responsible for the kiosk during snowstorm. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4553.641s">Well,</a> we might as well go through them. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4554.622s">If</a> we're going to make these all amendments. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4556.083s">Are</a> you making amendments?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4568.431s">The</a> contract and the amendments that were given to us in addition. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4571.953s">Rather</a> than one question at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4574.374s">Addendums,</a> not amendments. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4575.715s">Addendums.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4577.296s">There</a> is a difference.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4586.009s">All</a> in favour? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4586.669s">Wait</a> a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4587.95s">One</a> last thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4588.891s">One</a> last thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4590.232s">If</a> we're not referring all of that, then we refer the mayor's press release, which he identifies four specific issues that are not found in the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4599.517s">How</a> are they found in the contract? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4600.878s">How</a> does he intend to implement these in the contract?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4608.471s">No,</a> no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4608.711s">This</a> is going to be part of it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4615.074s">No,</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4616.374s">You're</a> going to be sending him the request for the Committee of the Whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4618.947s">And</a> also- No, no, no.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4675.887s">But</a> on the motion to also include the mayor's October 7 press release, where he identifies four specifics recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4685.87s">Have</a> him explain how this is part of the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4689.432s">We</a> will do that at the Committee of the Whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4690.972s">No,</a> but he has to have the paper so he knows.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4695.134s">Well,</a> we'll give you a copy.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7912.552s">That's</a> OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7914.013s">You</a> have a lot of questions into this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7917.055s">So</a> let's do the first one first, OK? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7920.738s">The</a> council resolution that's here right now is regarding salaries to be paid in part from the water and sewer account. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7930.285s">And</a> this is allowed by law to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7934.107s">Now</a> the part that I'll agree with you is that we're presently sitting on $8.4 million as a surplus in the water and sewer account. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7942.607s">that</a> the mayor does not want to give back our program for any construction projects because it hasn't come before us.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7983.71s">On</a> the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7985.171s">Let's</a> go back to the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7986.032s">The</a> reason why this paper is laid on the table so long is because of the vote that took place by the council regarding the $600,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7993.364s">that</a> the council voted to take out of the budget this year, and we wanted a report back from the mayor as to how he was gonna offset the $600,000 in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8002.249s">Council</a> voted unanimously to lay the paper on the table till we got that answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8006.311s">We</a> still haven't gotten that answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8008.792s">So</a> I'm gonna move that the paper lay on the table till we get that answer.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8065.469s">It's</a> kind of ironic when the council can vote seven to nothing waiting for a response to come back from the mayor and you don't get it back. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8072.074s">And</a> this goes back to when we voted for this in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8075.096s">This</a> is now October and that's number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8078.699s">And</a> number two, <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8080.066s">you're</a> taking the money out of that account for which, what happened to the $600,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8085.068s">Are</a> we going to get a request to make all kinds of transfers from one account to another? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8092.831s">Are</a> we going to have like $600,000 automatically going to come from the water and sewer account to balance the budget again? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8099.553s">I</a> think this is wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8100.474s">If</a> the council is going to take votes, you should stick to your votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8102.595s">You</a> voted seven to nothing, every single one behind this rail to get a report back.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8134.445s">So</a> with that being said, why did you vote before in June? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8137.793s">7</a> to nothing to lay it on the table to get a report backwards to it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8141.555s">Well,</a> I think, I think you should go back and check it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8143.716s">What</a> date was it? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8144.276s">Can</a> you tell me? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8144.996s">Whenever</a> we voted in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8146.317s">Whenever</a> we voted in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8147.237s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8267.771s">That</a> meeting, TR ratification is for the purposes of the new tiered system that the city is engaged on and the water rate increases as it's built into the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8278.434s">Now</a> getting to your point, did you just say you were a landlord?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8281.675s">Is</a> it a two family house?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8283.395s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8283.655s">You</a> should be getting at least six bills a year from the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8287.67s">And</a> if you're getting six bills a year, and if you're only paying $1,600, not only, you're paying $1,600. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8294.895s">Wait</a> a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8296.476s">If</a> you're paying $1,600, and they're attaching that to your, you said they're attaching that to your real estate bill?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8307.464s">So</a> are you saying that the very last water bill you got was for $1,600, or is this an accumulation? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8312.208s">Accumulation.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8313.36s">Oh,</a> it's an accumulation.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8329.043s">She's</a> about to go to college. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8330.463s">And</a> what about your tenant? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8331.683s">Two.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8332.324s">Two,</a> OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8333.384s">So</a> what's going to happen is, I don't know if you'll get your particular resolution resolved, <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8340.205s">You'd</a> be better going to the Water and Soil Commission meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8342.708s">They</a> meet in the afternoon once a month, and just explain to them that if you have a problem paying your bill because it's too much, you can go into a payment agreement downstairs in the Treasurer-Collector's office, and they will be able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8354.842s">But</a> if you just keep going and not paying for your bill, they will put that attachment on there.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8361.343s">Pardon</a> me?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8422.923s">Well,</a> that's the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8423.624s">This</a> is the mayor's proposal, not the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8426.144s">This</a> is the mayor raising the rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8428.52s">part</a> of the new DPW yard.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8438.885s">Wait</a> a minute, slow down. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8439.865s">That</a> is not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8440.506s">We</a> have nothing in front of us that says that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8445.208s">Yeah,</a> but we don't have it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8470.327s">Listen,</a> all I know is in that night, seven members of council agreed, because you laid the paper on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8475.37s">How</a> do you lay the paper on the table without taking a vote? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8479.513s">The</a> ayes have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8479.933s">Continue.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9269.292s">One</a> quick thing to get back to what Councilor Marks was alluding to. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9272.513s">With</a> this new, where's Marie, is she still here? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9276.513s">You're</a> still here? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9278.554s">With</a> this new tiered rate system that you should have gotten in your last bill, it was very hard, it wasn't even addressed, it didn't have the right time or the date, it wasn't stamped, and it gave zero to 800, 800 to 1,600, and 1,600. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9292.317s">Those</a> were the three tiered sections. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9293.457s">Councilor</a> Marks alluded to it, <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9299.425s">getting</a> after those people who use the most amount of water, they would be paying more. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9303.888s">Unfortunately,</a> the way the Water and Soil Commission has set this up, the people who use the most amount of water, which would be commercial, in the commercial section, they're going to be paying one stationary rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9315.837s">That's</a> the middle rate of the tiered rate system. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9318.519s">So</a> if you own a home, as you do, and you use more than 1,650 cubic feet of <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9326.917s">your</a> house altogether uses more, you're going to be paying at a higher rate than someone who uses a lot more water. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9332.9s">And</a> these are some of the questions that need to get addressed and discussed at the commission coming up, because it's a little bit unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9339.783s">I</a> mean, they're saying you average it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9341.864s">If</a> you have one person living on the first floor, and five people living on the second, and three people living on the third, they're telling you to get the number, average it out, and divide it by three. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9351.032s">And</a> that's what everybody should be paying. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9352.752s">It</a> doesn't work that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9355.693s">And</a> that's what we need to address. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9358.113s">I</a> think they probably came out with this a little bit too early. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9360.494s">It</a> should have been discussed a little more. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9362.474s">But</a> these are some of the questions that need to get resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9366.855s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1067.545s">Councilor</a> Pentec. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1068.666s">Well,</a> this is very unusual to have at a Medford City Council meeting, three acknowledgments in a row. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1074.248s">This</a> is like a triple play. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1075.832s">This</a> is all good news. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1077.573s">And</a> what's going on in the world, in the city, in the town, in the states today, it's nice to have recognition for folks who really deserve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1085.019s">We</a> all know Fred. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1086.56s">If</a> you don't know Fred, former member of our Medford School Committee, family man. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1091.444s">But</a> as the executive director of the MWRA, he's the guy, unfortunately, that when you get your water bill, you think it's kind of high. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1097.048s">It's</a> not from him. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1098.229s">He</a> only sells it to us wholesale. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1100.171s">So</a> it's what the city charges after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1103.544s">The</a> award that Fred received is kind of like unique. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1106.746s">He</a> received it from a company called ABC. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1109.227s">And</a> they're an independent membership-based organization here in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1114.971s">And</a> what they do is they advance significant transportation development and environmental policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1121.835s">And</a> Fred, for many years, as you know, or if you don't know, has been the executive director of the MWRA. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1127.579s">And</a> by being there, he has brought forward many innovative and environmental-friendly <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1134.953s">management</a> techniques as well as work techniques that have just really advanced the MWRA to be a very sophisticated, technological, and water-environmental friendly organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1145.982s">That's</a> basically what the award was that Fred received because of his environmental participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1152.247s">And</a> as a result of that, and knowing that his wife Donna is in the audience tonight, and once again, a teacher and a supporter of Mr. Petralas, <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1160.703s">It's</a> just a family ongoing thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1162.723s">Um,</a> their community driven spirit is here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1166.524s">And</a> I think it's great that we're acknowledging three method individuals tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1170.425s">Now</a> it's Fred Lasky's turn. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1172.386s">And</a> I would just like to say thank you to Mr. Lasky, uh, for doing the job, um, that a lot of people probably would not want to have, but at the same time being recognized for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1182.348s">Um,</a> because this award, uh, is a very prestigious award. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1185.288s">It's</a> only in its fourth year of operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1188.12s">And</a> Fred is the fourth person to get this environmental award. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1191.922s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to forward the commendation to Mr. Lasky. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1197.725s">And</a> if he wishes, he could come before the council at a future date to receive it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1201.506s">But</a> I didn't want any more time to go by without the acknowledgement being recognized.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1699.305s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1700.446s">As</a> an aside to that, we have asked for, on numerous occasions, I report back from the administration <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1707.293s">on</a> waste management's cost analysis with the city as it relates to not only the trash refuse, but also to the recycling. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1716.956s">And</a> we have never gotten that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1718.857s">And</a> like we did last year, unfortunately, at the end of the year, we were hit with an expensive bill of $159,000 to offset supposedly the net of not having enough refuse, not enough recycling to meet the contract of its needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1733.941s">So</a> again, this is the fourth, maybe fifth time <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1736.536s">We're</a> asking for that breakdown, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1739.677s">I</a> believe the way we used to get it before was broken down over the 10-year length of the contract, what was anticipated, what had been spent from prior years as compared to the one coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1751.08s">So</a> I think that would be helpful to the resolution that's before us.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1994.233s">So</a> right now you're just operating off the temporary. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1996.234s">And</a> once this goes in, it'll be.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2685.478s">Councilor</a> Bender. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2688.283s">Councilor</a> Del Russo, that's absurd. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2689.924s">You're</a> not going to vote for something tonight and then refer it back and possibly get a different opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2694.387s">All</a> our common vigil licenses we have voted for in the past, Mr. Clark, have been by regular mail. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2700.35s">They</a> haven't been by certified mail. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2702.212s">Why</a> would Coles be any different than any other common vigil license? <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2706.794s">Extended</a> hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2707.875s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2708.115s">Why</a> would that be it?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2718.276s">The</a> clerk, the clerk.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2968.388s">Point</a> of clarification, Mr. Clark, solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2973.049s">To</a> the best of your knowledge, is the repair shops the only one by statute <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2979.032s">that</a> requires certified mail?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2993.26s">So</a> it would seem that whether the practice was right or wrong in the past, if this be the case now, and this is the state statute, and we don't have anything to challenge this, this is what the law is. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3003.585s">It's</a> clearly what the law is. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3004.866s">By</a> regular mail. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3006.066s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3006.407s">So</a> we don't need any meeting, Councilor De La <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3009.339s">to</a> try to figure this out. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3010.76s">I</a> think it's quite obvious.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3058.133s">who</a> this is going to apply to.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3211.726s">The</a> post office will give you a receipt and stamp it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3214.349s">And</a> if you're signing up 286 and it's off on the city of Bedford, they'll time it, they'll date it, and they'll stamp it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3381.352s">bicycle</a> enthusiasts out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3384.033s">We</a> all know we've seen a great influx of bicyclists in our community, as a matter of fact, in the whole Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3391.716s">And</a> if anybody read Sunday's newspaper in the Boston Globe, they had printed a story about bike fatalities in the greater Boston suburbs and how they've increased from 2010, 11, and 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3401.5s">Unfortunately,</a> some people died. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3410.548s">And</a> apparently, that's unfortunate. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3413.15s">It's</a> an issue right now, I think, that needs to be dealt with as it relates to the public safety portion of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3419.795s">The</a> popularity of biking is greatly soared. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3423.719s">And</a> state policy, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3425.42s">Department</a> of Transportation, and local communities, like Somerville, who's basically one of the communities, like Boston, that's in the forefront of having bicycle-friendly roadways <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3438.79s">and</a> amenities that would be complementary to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3442.453s">But</a> the concern, as it relates to where we're going with all these bicycle and bicycle paths in communities such as Medford, which has a bicycle commission, just how much of an input, and more importantly, how much of a control do we have? <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3461.786s">Out</a> of the 557 schools in the Commonwealth <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3468.129s">signed</a> up on the state DOT program. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3471.331s">Only</a> 17 of them are actually implementing bicycle safety programs that at least meet the minimal standards that Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3479.514s">Department</a> of Transportation is asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3482.236s">The</a> confusion that's taking place on the roadway, especially for people who are driving cars as compared to when they look at a cyclist, is that, you know, who in fact has the right of way? <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3496.662s">Who's</a> got the rules of the road? <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3498.343s">who's</a> supposed to follow what, when, and how. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3501.245s">And</a> the educational process, once again, really should fall on local communities, because if local communities are going to start with having bicycle-friendly streets and providing certain roadways or pathways or whatever the terminology might be that you would want to have for bicyclists, an educational process needs to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3526.245s">And</a> if it doesn't take place, <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3528.297s">There's</a> a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3528.918s">There's</a> a concern to the bicyclist, the person driving the bike, riding the bike, and the person driving the car. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3534.703s">And</a> because of that, you know, this prompted me to turn around and think about, you know, it's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3540.587s">It's</a> a great form of exercise medically. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3542.809s">We</a> all know that riding a bike is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3545.972s">But</a> we also know that there's a concern that's predicating some of these safety issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3552.597s">And</a> one of the concerns seems to be the speed of some of the <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3556.203s">cyclist</a> when they're riding their bikes. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3558.584s">And</a> the other one, going through stop signs and driving through crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3564.068s">And</a> they seem to be the three major concerns of the cities and towns that I reviewed in the Mass State Department of Transportation's concerns, since they've now started to inventory bicycle accidents. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3578.516s">But</a> Boston thus far has yet to do an inventory of bicycle accidents. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3584.841s">Bicycles,</a> again, according to Section 11B of Chapter 85, bicycles shall be subject to the traffic laws and regulations of the Commonwealth and special regulations as found in the particular section. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3600.408s">And</a> the section that I want to get into is the bike in and of itself in hours after dark, before dusk and after dark. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3609.392s">The</a> operator, this is what the law says, that the operator shall display <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3613.16s">To</a> the front of the bicycle, a lamp emitting a white light visible from a distance of at least 500 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3620.562s">In</a> the rear of the bicycle, a light emanating — a red light emanating for not less than 600 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3626.523s">Now,</a> if you can imagine what it's like driving a car at nighttime and looking out 600 feet and looking at a little dinky red light, good luck to you, because a lot of the times they don't exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3638.966s">And</a> a lot of the folks that are driving these bikes don't even have these lights on. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3643.485s">So</a> now we get into initial call enforcement, and where the police department, another part of their job, but bikes are having their way on the roadways, and rightfully so. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3654.35s">And</a> they deserve to be protected just as much as the person driving the car. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3658.031s">And</a> they also talk about having on the ankles some type of reflective material. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3663.654s">And</a> once I saw this thing about the reflective material, that's the thing that got to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3668.436s">I</a> would like to propose, and hopefully my colleagues will be supportive, and also <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3673.634s">I</a> had a conversation with Bruce Kulick, who happens to be the chairman of the Bicycle Commission, and I think we're on the same page on this one, that the drivers of a bicycle at nighttime wear some type of a jacket or whatever it might be of a reflective type of material. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3691.105s">How</a> many times have you driven down the street at nighttime and you see someone with dark clothes on in a crosswalk and you might miss them? <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3697.709s">How</a> many times do you see a bike driving down the street at dusk and even late at night <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3702.665s">and</a> have absolutely nothing on that would identify them as a person on a bike by way of color, reflection, or what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3710.85s">There</a> is no state law out there right now that makes it a mandatory requirement for the purposes of a male or female driving a bicycle having a reflector jacket type of garment on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3728.278s">This</a> is going to be taking up the same type of fuel. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3731.76s">It's</a> going to be building up momentum, because as we know, the law that's out there, trying to be out there, that you can't text and drive at the same time, because we know the consequences that can happen by way of accidents. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3744.827s">Well,</a> the same thing is going to be happening with these bicyclists, because we know that they're becoming more and more of them out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3751.491s">Each</a> and every community, including Medford, have more and more bicyclists. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3755.313s">And</a> bicycle folks are going to drive <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3757.07s">whether</a> they come from Medford or out of town or what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3759.791s">But</a> there has to be some mode of protection and identification that is protective to these folks that are driving a bike. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3769.914s">And</a> again, there is nothing in the state law that really goes out of its way that basically says, other than some little, and I'll call it stupid thing you put on your ankle, that who the hell is going to see a reflector thing 600 feet away, as compared to maybe having a reflector type jacket. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3787.763s">that</a> identifies itself, green, yellow, orange, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3791.506s">It</a> may not be the most social-looking piece of garment you'd want to wear, but if it's going to protect and save your life, you know, it does the thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3802.976s">So,</a> with that being said, Mr. President, and I don't know if there's anybody here from the Bicycle Commission who would like to speak on it or what have you, but I would appreciate not only their comments, but more importantly, their support for this because <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3817.659s">Again,</a> reviewing the accidents as they have been presented and looking at the statistics, and I believe the statistics are going up, they're not going down, on bicycle accidents and, unfortunately, people dying from bicycle accidents, and I believe every single one of them have not been identified with anything at nighttime that would be reflective type of material that would present a safety condition for the person riding the bike.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3875.502s">I</a> am proposing the same way the state legislature has these amendments that have been forthcoming and the law has amended that we again amend the law that makes a requirement statewide for any person riding a bicycle from dawn to dusk that they have to wear some type of reflective type of material easily identifiable by a headlight and an oncoming car or a car behind you or whatever.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3915.723s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3945.268s">I'm</a> not talking about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3946.369s">I'm</a> talking about wearing a jacket, something that could be seen and highly visible. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3950.632s">If</a> you ever get behind a car 600 feet, <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3952.992s">and</a> try to find that little reflector on the pedal, or on their foot, or the little red light behind a bike that 90% of the time doesn't work, and they run by battery. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3962.214s">Or</a> you see a little white headlight that's 500 feet away on a bike that doesn't cut the mustard when a car is driving down the street, or even if a truck is driving down the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3970.876s">I</a> mean, it's, it's.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3978.957s">Amend</a> it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3988.537s">To</a> a vest. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3989.457s">Or</a> a garment type of material, vest, jacket, or what have you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4078.017s">This</a> is directed toward people who drive a bike. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4082.599s">And</a> I believe the cyclists that drive a bike have to wear a helmet. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4085.901s">Isn't</a> that required by law too?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4088.182s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4090.126s">If</a> somebody decides from dawn to dusk they want to drive a bike on a sidewalk or a street, the requirement's going to be the same because you're riding a bike. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4099.012s">And</a> according to Chapter 85, Section, I think it's 10 and 11, there are certain requirements that you have to follow the same rules of the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4106.818s">And</a> the only exception to the rules of the road, I believe, if you're going, exiting, or entering on a highway and anything else that might be specifically excluded by state statute. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4116.1s">So</a> I think we're all on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4117.701s">I</a> think so too. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4118.441s">And</a> the more, I think the more support we get for it, you know, and explaining it, I think it, you know, it bears fruit. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4124.244s">This</a> isn't like wearing a heavy jacket and the winter time. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4126.865s">It's</a> just, you know, it's something.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4247.851s">One</a> quick thing, and I brought up an issue, there's 557 schools at the present time that are supposed to be, that are allegedly participants in the Department of Transportation public safety program for schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4260.448s">And</a> only 17 of these communities have jumped on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4264.632s">Is</a> Method one of the 17 or not? <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4267.094s">Are</a> you aware of?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4278.564s">Yeah,</a> right.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4288.184s">But</a> see, that's the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4289.525s">Signing</a> up as compared to having the program implemented, that's the issue.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4311.707s">So</a> right now the Roberts was on the book, but we haven't implemented the program yet.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4337.54s">Okay,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4398.988s">President,</a> since last Tuesday night until now, <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4405.577s">I</a> think we've all, I'll speak for myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4407.538s">I</a> received a considerable amount of phone calls from not only Method business folks on two particular issues, this and the raising and the water rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4415.221s">But</a> we'll stick to this issue right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4417.481s">And</a> the unfortunate part about it is what we heard last Tuesday night, part of the issue is not whether you're now for it or against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4427.645s">The</a> issue now revolves itself around the fact that the mayor had made a promise that he was going to have a public hearing on this particular matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4435.687s">um,</a> resolution 14, six 45, which was offered by myself and subsequently amended by council Lungo passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4444.128s">Uh,</a> and that was some two weeks ago, I think it was in September 23rd and asking the mayor to have a public meeting and a hearing throughout this community, whether it be here at city hall or wherever, wherever it's so big that citizens and, and, um, business folks would have an opportunity to come and express their opinion, whether they were forward against it or more importantly, <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4464.645s">as</a> to what the mayor's proposal was. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4466.867s">And</a> I think after we knew last Tuesday night coming into our council meeting that at five o'clock the mayor had sent out a press release indicating that he had signed the contract, I think that sort of like took us all off guard, especially to the point that no public meeting ever took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4481.878s">Then</a> more importantly, or as importantly, last week the president of the chamber came down here and indicated that the chamber had taken an official position for the purposes of supporting <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4495.25s">The</a> contract for what information Councilor Dello Russo.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4506.815s">The</a> question becomes relevant because the concerns that were expressed at the meeting of the 10th of September and all seven members of the council had concerns as it related to, uh, what might or what might not be in the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4521.041s">And</a> in fact, we as a council, <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4523.292s">We</a> as a council had never been advised or never even shown what the finality of the contract was. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4529.836s">But</a> after listening to the president of the chamber, he particularly was involved with the mayor, and the mayor allowed him to be involved in making the final decisions or agreeing to the concessions of the final decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4542.724s">Well,</a> that's all well and good. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4544.666s">But</a> the Chamber of Commerce is not the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4547.788s">And</a> the Medford City Council was owed that due respect from the mayor <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4552.032s">that</a> the finality of signing that contract, or before it was to take place, should have come before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4558.714s">We</a> all discussed it, and we all had an opinion on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4561.655s">Whether</a> you were for it or against it, that wasn't the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4564.636s">The</a> fact of the matter was to have the public hearing or the public meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4568.237s">Call</a> it what you may. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4569.258s">Let</a> taxpayers, let residents, and business owners come up and have an opportunity to speak on something that they didn't even know what was going on, that they were just finding out about. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4581.636s">The</a> president of the chamber indicated when the question was asked that he only represents members of the chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4588.68s">He</a> doesn't represent any other business people. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4591.262s">Well,</a> I think that's an injustice to every other business person in this community who's a taxpayer and has employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4598.206s">There</a> are people that maybe don't want to become members of the chamber or just don't have the time to become members of the chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4603.51s">And</a> they should not be looked upon as a second grade or a second class citizen. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4607.5s">for</a> the purposes of whether you agree or disagree with a pay-to-park program. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4611.721s">One</a> information, Councilor De La Russa.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4632.526s">Mr.</a> President, I think if you review the tape, the tape is as clear as can be. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4636.525s">that</a> Mr. White indicated that subsequent to the 10th meeting of September, he asked the mayor to be a part of what the concerns were of the chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4645.689s">And</a> as a result of that, he met with the chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4648.19s">And</a> as a matter of fact, he said he was satisfied with the concessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4651.892s">But</a> it was the same person who, quote, in the paper, indicated that all business districts in this community are unique until they have their own special problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4661.777s">And</a> by having your own special problems, which they need to be discussed, <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4665.12s">and</a> be reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4666.12s">And</a> that was on the 2nd of October. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4669.542s">Five</a> days after that, the 7th of October, the mayor signs the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4673.903s">That's</a> kind of quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4675.424s">None</a> of these people from the other sections of the city were involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4679.145s">No</a> business people. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4680.225s">And</a> once again, no taxpayers, no rate payers in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4684.527s">And</a> with that happening, <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4686.37s">It</a> makes you subject to the question of the Chamber of Commerce. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4689.872s">They</a> don't know whether they have 200 or 300 members. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4692.873s">So</a> whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4694.154s">And</a> if it's 200 members and only a specific board, the Governmental Affairs Committee voted, what they voted for, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4701.137s">The</a> Chamber of Commerce, I don't know.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4715.007s">Well,</a> Mr. President, since Councilor Dello Russo and you, Councilor Caraviello, are both members of the chamber, I would see that you have a prejudice here to support the chamber's position, no matter what this one councilor has to say.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4726.05s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4726.55s">Well,</a> since you have no prejudice, maybe Councilor Dello Russo does. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4729.131s">But,</a> you know, we also asked for what was going to be included and what was going to be excluded.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4741.195s">Well,</a> he hasn't indicated it publicly, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4743.36s">That</a> leaves a suspect right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4745.681s">And</a> I believe it was the president of the chamber who indicated that he was happy to have been part of the process meeting with the mayor and coming to this concession through resolutions for whatever it might have been. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4756.804s">This</a> council was never apprised of any of whatever a concession might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4761.705s">This</a> one size fits all for all five districts, which includes Medford Square, it just doesn't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4768.627s">It</a> doesn't cut the mustard. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4770.888s">And</a> more importantly, <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4773.033s">It's</a> a recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4774.494s">If</a> you look at the press release that the mayor said, now I asked the city clerk today, um, I had called earlier and still I don't have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4782.837s">Does</a> anyone behind this rail have a copy of the contract either on disk?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4793.081s">Oh,</a> by the messenger. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4794.202s">That's</a> really nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4795.062s">Moments</a> ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4795.683s">Here</a> we have, we asked for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4797.04s">You</a> know, here we have an $18 million, 10-year contract, and we just get the information now. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4801.824s">But</a> the chamber was aware of it, and they agreed to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4804.646s">And</a> I really have a suspect that I don't think the chamber was in agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4808.589s">I</a> think if you took a poll of their membership and had a discussion of what's going on on those four priority sections, you'd have a better idea as to what their feelings might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4817.816s">And</a> maybe Councilor Dello Russo was right, because when the mayor two Saturdays ago took a walk in the Westmethod area, I don't think he liked the response that he got, whether it was a <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4825.828s">business</a> person of the chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4827.229s">I'm</a> not a business person of the chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4829.39s">This</a> is business in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4832.071s">People</a> are putting their daily work on their line. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4836.946s">They're</a> not worried about the chamber being supportive of them, they need to make money, they have to pay their employees, they need to pay their insurance, they need to pay everything that makes a business work. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4846.456s">Not</a> every single person in this community or every single business in this community is a member of the chamber, and rightfully so. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4853.504s">They</a> don't have to be and they shouldn't be if they so choose not to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4857.848s">So</a> why the mayor decides to pick on this one organization as to be the only organization to make his recommendations and his concessions with, I don't know, but he should have been before this Medford City Council and the taxpayers of this community to give his final decision of whatever he thought he was going to do by way of having a public hearing to get some input. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4879.745s">On</a> May 20th of this past year, we voted to give the mayor the opportunity to deal with a single-person contract <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4887.459s">for</a> 10 years, because the law says anything over three years, you have to take a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4891.821s">We</a> didn't tell him to sign it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4893.422s">What</a> we said is to go and make your contract negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4896.524s">Come</a> back before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4898.305s">Come</a> back before the council and tell us what you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4900.867s">The</a> law says the council makes the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4903.328s">The</a> council will only vote if him to go and to engage in a contract, not to sign the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4909.282s">If</a> that be the case, then what was the purpose of us even being here? <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4912.524s">We</a> shouldn't even be discussing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4914.025s">It</a> means absolutely nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4915.386s">He</a> shouldn't have even had the meeting on September 10th. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4918.648s">This</a> is all for nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4920.189s">But</a> his back got against the wall because he heard from some of the business people. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4924.512s">And</a> unfortunately, once again, the president of the chamber said, <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4927.777s">Most</a> of the people in the room that night weren't even chamber members. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4930.779s">So</a> what does that mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4931.82s">Just</a> because they're not chamber members. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4934.202s">They're</a> business people in this community who pay their taxes and employ people and have residents come to their stores and buy their products so they can have a living and make a living. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4945.57s">Mr.</a> President, you're a member of the chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4947.672s">You</a> and I have had this discussion numerous times on numerous occasions. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4951.474s">And</a> as you've been aware, <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4953.481s">many</a> people. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4954.082s">You</a> told me you went to, you told me you went to the groundbreaking ceremonies, the bank over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4958.628s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4959.41s">Last</a> Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4960.351s">You</a> told me the mayor had to run away because everybody was on top of them because of the parking thing.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4966.279s">Friday,</a> excuse me, on Friday.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4973.617s">You</a> were there after the fact because you know, I was, I was there for the opening.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4978.399s">He</a> had to leave because everybody was complaining about that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4981.64s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4981.94s">That's</a> something else. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4982.661s">Well,</a> same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4983.601s">You</a> go to so many of these inaugurals. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4984.962s">I</a> have no idea which ones that we were at, but the fact of the matter is this, um, I just think it's unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4991.825s">And</a> I, and I really don't know because if the press release is only nothing more than recommendations, <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4999.185s">then</a> they don't have to adhere to anything, this company called Republic. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5003.348s">And</a> the aggressiveness, as Councilor Marks alluded to last week, they're going to start at 7 in the morning to 7 at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5008.211s">They</a> need to do a million, $2 million a year as a minimum to start. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5011.513s">You</a> know yourself as well as I. They're going to be out there writing tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5015.095s">But</a> the cream, the cream to this whole deal is that the mayor retains the appeal process. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5021.839s">And</a> to me, that is political because if it wasn't going to be political and it was going to be independent, he should have given it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5028.841s">So</a> City Hall still remains as the political process of appeal to this whole particular program. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5035.646s">And</a> as what took place today at the Traffic Commission, they indicated, you know, they will still have the authority to set the places and set the rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5045.012s">But</a> we still don't know the exact spots of where things are going, and we don't really know who's going to be excluded.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5065.155s">Well,</a> how do you, how does any one councilor justify the fact that a contract was signed and you never even saw it? <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5074.238s">You</a> voted for something that you asked the mayor to do, and he didn't do it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5132.345s">But</a> point of further clarification, you hit it right in the head. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5135.286s">You</a> gave him the authority to negotiate, but not to sign the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5138.567s">And</a> that's what he did. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5139.487s">He</a> signed the contract without any one of us having an opportunity to see it and discuss it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5218.33s">We</a> were never given a contract to look at an executive session. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5222.213s">The</a> only thing we had an executive session, which was only once, that was May 20. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5226.14s">and</a> that was to pick the Republic from Tennessee. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5229.181s">Yes,</a> we told them to go ahead and negotiate a contract, but we didn't tell them to sign it because if you read the minutes and you look at the tape, it turns around and you have to come back to the council for the vote to accept it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5243.244s">They</a> don't make one.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5262.641s">Say</a> that again, Councilor De La Rosa. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5264.223s">To</a> what? <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5264.684s">Style</a> what?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5272.753s">What</a> do you mean, style enforcement? <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5274.776s">What's</a> that?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5292.483s">Enforcement</a> is not the same as pay-to-park. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5294.485s">It's</a> two entirely different subject matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5296.927s">The</a> mayor decided to make it even more. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5298.988s">This</a> council was looking for enforcement.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5305.092s">It's</a> about paying to park.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5322.628s">That's</a> what he said in his press release.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5372.384s">This,</a> this, this says parking proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5380.871s">It</a> doesn't say parking.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5978.617s">I'd</a> like to further amend it to contact the state department of public health as it relates to, cause they, there is a state policy on electronic cigarettes and a cigarette is considered a cigarette no matter how you use it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5991.106s">So</a> that may be able to just to cut right through the chase and get your answer.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5998.696s">The</a> State Department of Public Health as it relates to electronic cigarettes. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=6002.997s">Massachusetts</a> State Department of Public Health.<h2><a href="../2024-10-16_QTGph9EVRy4/2024-10-16_QTGph9EVRy4.html">Medford, MA City Council - Oct. 7, 2014 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1109.584s">Mr.</a> President, I think in part we all know that around 5 o'clock or 5.30 this evening, I think we received the mayor's press release. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1120.506s">that</a> he'd signed the contract with Republic from Tennessee. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1123.708s">But</a> I'll get to that later on. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1125.17s">It's</a> still part of the comparison. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1127.672s">You</a> know, when we came on board at the beginning of the year, we were asked to give what our priorities were. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1131.515s">And</a> I believe the police department and police station was our number one priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1136.018s">And</a> unfortunately, it hasn't found itself anywhere in any of the mayor's agendas. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1141.803s">Now,</a> the police station would derive an extreme benefit for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1147.027s">It</a> would make us go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1149.571s">not</a> only socially, but as a community going forward with tomorrow's technology, and it would also give a presence of community policing. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1160.516s">And</a> that's something I think a lot of the people asking for, more police officers, more patrolmen, more visibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1167.699s">And</a> if you give them a better place to work out of, then I think that would go a long way. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1174.341s">You</a> know, we paid in excess, I think, of $78,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1178.979s">when</a> we received the feasibility study from the police department and the fire department on May 5th of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1185.881s">And</a> unfortunately for the police department, they didn't get anything out of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1189.182s">Fire</a> department did, but the police department didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1192.864s">And</a> once again, I don't know, maybe it's just the mayor, he doesn't have it on his radar screen, but public safety, I believe is the first of priorities here of any of all the councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1204.168s">Some</a> of the things that Mr. Mayor, that would be beneficial, not only for our community, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1209.378s">is</a> the council has supported, in each and every calendar budget, the recycling of two new cruises each and every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1218.363s">And</a> that would go a long way, once again, to add to the police officers on duty, driving their cruises, letting them know that the city is thinking about them, and they don't have to drive in a car that has about 140,000 miles on it, and they don't know if it's gonna make it or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1233.892s">I</a> think it was Councilor Marks, three years ago, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1238.24s">came</a> up with the idea of why can't we have a special truck enforcement unit? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1241.321s">It's</a> a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1243.522s">What's</a> wrong with training one or two people to be involved with truck enforcement for that particular purpose? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1249.584s">Because</a> I think we can go down any one of these streets in any one of these days, and we see the amount of trucks that travel down High Street, Main Street, or the major streets here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1258.407s">That</a> would go a long way. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1260.588s">In</a> our public safety issue regarding lighting, all the squares are just dimly lit. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1266.069s">And</a> that in and of itself is an invitation <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1268.356s">for</a> some type of crime, whatever the crime might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1271.358s">You</a> get Route 16, the parking lot behind St. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1274.16s">Joe's.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1274.981s">This</a> will probably be the 14th time that we've discussed this, and still no lighting. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1280.045s">We've</a> had situations there where a lady called up and she was afraid to get into a car because of people there, and also in a separate situation where a drug transaction was reported. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1289.572s">Also</a> right here in Medford Square, the Route 16 overpass, underpass on Route 93, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1294.71s">has</a> no lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1296.091s">Riverside</a> Avenue, go underneath the overpass there, still no lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1300.812s">We</a> have asked for the issue of public safety, timely street swiping. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1305.514s">We've</a> also asked for our crosswalk painting. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1308.095s">You're</a> lucky if you see that once a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1310.856s">These</a> aren't huge cost items. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1312.756s">These</a> are items that are readily available within our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1316.538s">Now</a> we've talked about police cameras and high visibility locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1321.151s">Were</a> it not for the business merchant that owned a store on the corner of George and Winthrop Street a few years, a couple of years back, how they caught the guy that assaulted the young lady from Tufts University. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1333.255s">And</a> as a result of that, Mr. President, we all know that the cameras are beneficial. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1338.22s">We</a> have $8,893 in our linkage account for where they could buy a few cameras. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1343.764s">But</a> if you really want to get into it, we have $6,400,000 in our free cash account. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1348.967s">So</a> I don't think there should be any reason why we can't go out there and buy any cameras. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1354.371s">A</a> bonus to our people that work. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1357.433s">We</a> can review the one day a week and swap day reward. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1361.095s">And</a> that would be for those officers with a perfect attendance for six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1365.238s">Something</a> different, something creative for the police officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1368.706s">rather</a> than the annual, it's on a six month basis, and that might work out, it's a tryout, it's something to think about. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1376.55s">I</a> think we should also think about revisiting the idea of having retired police personnel be part of the parking enforcement proposal here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1384.815s">Because</a> that in and of itself, that in and of itself would bring a big luxury, not only to the people here in this community, but I think to the business people who would have a better idea of knowing <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1397.748s">when</a> and how to tag certain folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1400.089s">Because</a> we really don't know what this out-of-state company from Tennessee is going to be like. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1404.952s">They</a> could just be, I don't know, they're going to start at 7 o'clock in the morning to 7 at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1408.674s">It</a> doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1410.115s">Boston</a> doesn't even start till 8 o'clock in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1413.217s">We</a> have a civil defense system that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1416.418s">Since</a> Mr. Mangone has passed on as its civil defense director, I don't know where it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1422.242s">Is</a> it in limbo? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1423.122s">Is</a> it going to be used? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1424.503s">If</a> not, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1425.657s">We've</a> talked about a snow emergency system, and we haven't heard anything back on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1429.099s">And</a> I think we're all aware of the fact that a snow emergency system of some type needs to be in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1436.545s">And</a> taking some of these issues and putting them on the left, then I go to the right, and I look at this idea of this new proposal that, if you agree or disagree, the mayor signed into effect apparently today regarding this Tennessee firm Republic. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1455.834s">regarding</a> a traffic enforcement program that's going to be six days a week from 7 in the morning to 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1462.839s">at</a> night. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1463.619s">There'll</a> be no free parking on the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1465.921s">According</a> to the mayor's commentary, there's going to be two 30-minute parking spots in each one of the squares, and there'll be four paid single-space meter spots in each of the four square districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1481.652s">Other</a> than that, there'll be kiosks allotted. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1485.652s">It's</a> kind of like interesting because if you look at the commentary made by the director from the Medford Chamber of Commerce, Mr. White, he indicated that he was hoping that he would have an opportunity with its members to sit down and discuss this. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1500.196s">And</a> he also made reference to the fact that each and every one of the squares have unique positions, unique concerns as it relates to businesses and how they might be affected. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1509.459s">How</a> the mayor came up to this resolution and signing, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1513.459s">But</a> it's kind of like unfair because we were in that meeting on September 10th, and we were told that he would get back to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1520.742s">We</a> were told that there'd be a public meeting for which this council voted seven to nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1524.724s">He</a> never honored that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1526.345s">We</a> were told also that the concerns that would be brought up would be addressed and to have an idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1531.767s">I</a> don't know, and we don't really know what part of the business community, what businesses are going to be exempt from not having a meter or a kiosk anywhere in that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1543.066s">You</a> take these two things and you ask yourself, the Medford Police Department and public safety is such a huge issue here in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1550.709s">And</a> some of the samples that I just talked about still have yet to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1554.971s">But</a> the mayor thinks it's more important to go forward with a parking enforcement program, strike that, a paid to park program with enforcement that's only going to bring in $300,000 the first year and $700,000 from the second to the ninth year, it's the 10th year. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1572.406s">May</a> sound like a lot of money, but my feeling personally would have been, had the city decided to go forward after that meeting on the 10th, having an opportunity to listen to the folks within our community, listen to the business in the community, all four areas of this community, rather than have one size fits all, which includes Medford Square, in the press release as outlined tonight at 510, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1599.947s">I</a> just don't think it serves in the best interest of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1603.148s">I</a> don't think it helps our police department, and I don't think it gives the community in and of itself a fair shot as it relates to priorities that need to be addressed rather than another money enhancement for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1617.853s">Mr.</a> President, today, as you know, I'm assuming all of you know that the mayor signed this contract tonight around 517 or thereabouts. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1628.397s">He</a> signed the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1629.758s">And</a> he makes a notation that the council was in support of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1634.7s">What</a> the council was in support of was that on May 20th, when we had that meeting, we had agreed to the three vendors that came in, one would be selected, which was Republic from Tennessee. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1645.264s">But</a> we agreed to that somebody would come back after he had negotiations and we would discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1651.107s">And</a> we did on September 10th. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1652.988s">But</a> when the pushback came back, the mayor decided not to go forward at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1657.709s">And</a> speaking to Mr. Skelton, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1659.443s">are</a> referring to Mr. Skelton's comments from Republic. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1662.726s">From</a> the 10th to the 25th of September, there was absolutely no communication between the mayor and Republic. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1669.411s">So</a> something had to take place from the 24th to today, the 7th. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1673.915s">And</a> taking that into consideration, it's quite obvious that the chamber's concerns, oh, I don't know who wrote the letter because we don't have a copy of the letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1681.081s">He</a> says he got a letter from the chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1682.963s">But</a> when you have four separate squares, including Medford Square, which makes five, and their issues are all unique, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1688.854s">and</a> they needed to be heard, and they weren't heard, and the mayor decides to have one size fits all, I don't think that's what you call a happy resolution, especially to the business people and to the taxpayers of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1700.818s">You</a> know, the fact of the matter is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1705.679s">We're</a> getting rid of people who don't live in the community, who were parking at spots all day long, and they haven't been tagged. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1713.322s">And</a> this has been going on for the entire years of the administration of this city, this mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1718.666s">And</a> now what we're going to be doing is tagging, if not towing, and telling our own taxpayers in this community, you people are going to have to start paying. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1728.072s">Now,</a> right up front, no free parking unless you are lucky enough to get one of those two spots in any one of the four or five sections of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1737.278s">Where</a> it's going, I don't know, Mr. President, but all I can tell you is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1741.381s">If</a> I had to put my money on something, I would put it on public safety, the police department, the personnel that's needed to keep this community safe, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1749.039s">And</a> more importantly, the subject matters that I brought up under the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1752.92s">Those</a> to me are pressing needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1755.661s">They</a> have no comparison, no comparison at all to a parking paid to park program or enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1763.163s">If</a> the mayor was so concerned about that paid to park program and enforcement, he should have done it years ago, but he didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1768.884s">And</a> when they knew that people from Winchester and other communities were coming here and parking all day and not getting tagged and ticketed, he should have done something, but he didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1777.607s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1778.148s">put</a> $300,000 this first year out of the box, compare everything to what the police department needs to keep our community safe and protected. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1786.535s">It's</a> pale in comparison. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1788.436s">And</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I just wanted to say that, um, I just think, you know, this council is either going to be committed to public safety and a new PlayStation and the police department, or this is nothing more than hot air every Tuesday night when we come here to talk about public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1804.54s">We</a> have more than enough examples. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1806.622s">And</a> I think we have more than enough good police officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1810.865s">The</a> shooting is just a drop in the bucket compared to all the drug problems that are existing throughout this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1816.609s">And</a> that's a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1818.07s">And</a> if they had more personnel, and if they could go to court, and if they had more of the mechanisms and the technology that is needed, it would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1828.597s">You</a> know, when you talk to someone, you say, hey, you're building a brand new public works department, $14 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1835.258s">$14</a> million. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1835.858s">Still</a> don't even have enough men to man it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1839.159s">But</a> you have a police department that's ready to fall apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1841.539s">You</a> have an evidence room that's completely out of control and a whole host of other issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1847.641s">So,</a> I would say, Mr. President and my fellow colleagues, that I think it's time that we take the stand and we tell the mayor we want a new police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1856.362s">I</a> don't care how you fund it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1857.863s">You</a> found the money for a public works department, then find the money for a police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1861.883s">Because</a> you're not going to make one seem to be more important than another. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1865.046s">And</a> at the same time, you're not going to put the lives of this community and the folks in this community at risk.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2711.653s">Mr.</a> President, um, I guess I missed this when I was reading it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2715.895s">If</a> you read the bottom of the mass comment, it says the chamber also acknowledged that there were several beneficial respects to the plan, such as user friendly kiosks, whatever that means. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2727.499s">After</a> deliberating and discussing concerns raised by the business community, the mayor is recommending the following changes to the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2735.962s">He's</a> recommending, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2738.8s">This</a> isn't a finality. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2741.641s">If</a> you go to point number three, it says recommend $250,000 of the revenue generated on an annual basis to be dedicated to the business district improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2751.584s">It's</a> a recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2752.965s">This</a> isn't a done deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2754.225s">And</a> if you have $250,000, what district gets it first? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2757.506s">North</a> Medford, South Medford, Boston Ave, Medford Square? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2761.447s">Where's</a> the determination there? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2762.968s">And</a> then the last one, retain business and commuter permits. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2765.609s">What</a> does that mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2767.446s">All</a> subjective commentary. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2770.148s">I</a> don't even know if this is really the done deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2773.031s">All</a> he's doing, he's saying he signed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2775.292s">And</a> I'm wondering if these are still things to be negotiated. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2779.536s">He's</a> recommending. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2781.057s">These</a> are recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2783.759s">They</a> may be just sticking to the original part of the plan and getting back to what Councilor Marks alluded to. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2789.324s">Not</a> only is it going to be aggressive enforcement, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2793.302s">But</a> why would you start at 7 o'clock in the morning? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2796.083s">Boston,</a> which is much bigger than Medford, starts at 8. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2800.203s">Brookline,</a> when they had their kiosks, they had to take them away because they were hurting the businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2806.344s">And</a> then if they're even recognizing by putting meters, single meters, in certain parts, well, maybe they should think about just putting meters, period, and see how that goes, and have local people do the enforcement part. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2820.094s">But</a> the more I keep reading this thing, words stand off a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2823.136s">It's</a> the terminology that's used. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2824.917s">He's</a> recommending. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2826.037s">So</a> I don't even know if this is a done deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2827.758s">None</a> of us know. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2830.48s">It's</a> two 30-minute free parking spaces in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2835.243s">Well,</a> who's in West Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2836.063s">Who's</a> it going to be? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2836.763s">Has</a> that been determined yet? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2837.684s">They're</a> going to flip a coin? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2840.085s">Go</a> to Boston Avenue, you're going to flip a coin? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2842.587s">The</a> whole length of that street, two free parking spaces? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2846.049s">And</a> then four paid single-space meter spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2850.427s">in</a> each of the above listed districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2853.969s">Who's</a> going to get those four? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2855.791s">And</a> as I said before, what businesses are going to be excluded rather than included? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2861.995s">You</a> know, the law is very specific on this, and I said it to you last week, and I'll say it to you again, and I said it to our chief procurement officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2869.72s">The</a> responsibility of bringing the contract forward was from the chief procurement officer, not from the mayor, and not from the budget director. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2878.205s">That's</a> what the law says. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2879.71s">And</a> there needed to be a recommendation in writing with a comparison of doing it in-house as compared to doing it out-house. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2887.393s">And</a> in this situation, we never got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2889.733s">We</a> never got the recommendation and how that recommendation was determined so as for the council to make a legitimate vote to go forward to accept it or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2900.137s">So</a> there's a whole host of issues that surround not only the mayor signing this or even getting to the point to having him sign it, but the fact that he lied <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2909.696s">He</a> lied to we, the people, by not coming and having the public forum for which seven members of this council voted on, to at least have a public forum, to at least have the business community, and at least have the taxpayers, the residents of the community, to come and speak up about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2924.399s">I</a> think we're all getting our emails, and people are just, once again, hearing about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2928.44s">Some</a> of them, not that they're for it, not some of them against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2931.4s">They</a> want to know more about it and how it's going to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2934.021s">But</a> apparently, the mayor doesn't want us to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2936.707s">It's</a> quite obvious. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2937.508s">He</a> certainly doesn't want the taxpayers and the residents to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2940.449s">And</a> however he chose what businesses that he met with, who knows what businesses they were that convinced him to go forward with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=2947.554s">It's</a> a damn shame, because I don't think this serves in the best interest of our community.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3388.617s">I</a> have four questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3390.378s">First</a> of all, you said that they took your quote out of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3394.301s">So</a> I'm going to read this quote. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3395.322s">You</a> tell me if it's accurate or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3397.363s">We're</a> going to let McGlynn quote, no, it's obvious to us that the different business districts have different needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3402.687s">White</a> said, we're not going to advocate for any specific district. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3406.39s">We're</a> going to provide opportunities through us to get those voices heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3409.752s">True</a> or false?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3414.736s">So</a> if that's true, and you're recognizing the different needs of the different areas, how can you go along and have one size fits all for all four districts?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3437.19s">Go</a> ahead.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3454.084s">That's</a> that part there. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3456.446s">You</a> said the chamber supports this. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3457.887s">How</a> many members in the chamber?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3480.727s">So</a> you have votes from the 200 plus members? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3484.168s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3484.868s">So</a> how does the chamber make a decision? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3487.065s">If</a> you have membership.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3489.427s">So</a> your board of directors made this vote, not the membership.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3503.515s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3504.196s">Let's</a> get this straight.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3528.291s">You</a> just made a comment at a minute ago that some of the people that are at that meeting on the 10th aren't members of the chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3533.053s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3534.153s">So</a> because someone is not a member of the chamber, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3537.096s">They're</a> not going to be looked upon with the same favor that somebody might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3540.218s">They're</a> a business person in this community.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3548.804s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3549.304s">You</a> represent your members. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3550.625s">And</a> you also said that the business community was aware of that meeting on the 20th.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3554.828s">I</a> mean on the 10th. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3555.829s">Excuse</a> me. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3556.289s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3556.71s">At</a> 117 in the afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3558.131s">That's</a> when the emails went out. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3560.632s">117</a> of the day of the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3562.814s">And</a> a lot of people didn't even get it because they were still at work and not knowing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3566.209s">So</a> that's not a well-advanced notice of people — of a public meeting regarding their living. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3571.051s">The</a> President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3575.694s">Mr.</a> Kudlow.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3580.957s">Mr.</a> Kudlow. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3581.957s">Also,</a> Mr. President, I do want to get back to this thing that if Mr. White feels, on behalf of his membership, that this one-size-fits-all is going to address the concerns <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3594.167s">of</a> the five separate, the four squares and the downtown method. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3597.949s">I'd</a> like to have you explain that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3599.37s">How</a> can this one size fits all?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3671.357s">So</a> then your quote in the paper was wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3673.779s">You</a> did not indicate that each part of the city is unique.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3695.036s">Mr.</a> President, I think we need to get a report back that are these four points recommendations, or are they actually part of the contract? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3704.162s">Because</a> it's the mayor who uses the term, he's recommending changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3708.43s">It</a> doesn't say it's not definitive, it's recommending. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3712.334s">And</a> with that being said, with recommendations, I don't know if it's a contract or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=3717.758s">I</a> don't know.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4073.869s">Clerk,</a> do you have enough poll workers?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4095.344s">During</a> the last election, there was some concern over some of the ballot boxes not working. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4099.147s">Is</a> there any of these?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4102.988s">But</a> aren't these all checked out before? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4105.169s">Oh</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4105.409s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4136.121s">Those</a> all rechecked each and every election? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4138.782s">How</a> does this work?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4152.212s">And</a> for the sake of a public announcement, Mr. President, when can people start getting an absentee ballot?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4246.071s">Mr.</a> President, Dorothy, as we all know, is our wonderful assistant in the clerk's office with Mr. Finn, and she works very hard through the years, and she's now being able to enjoy her grandchild, her son's first child, which would be her grandchild, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4260.587s">And</a> we want to wish her the best.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4665.085s">The</a> only problem with the dog park has been the mayor is telling everyone it's going to cost $200,000 and he's telling people to go out and do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4672.391s">You</a> know, I mean, how do you turn around and tell the people you go out and get the dog park? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4676.935s">And</a> as Councilor Marks alluded to before, you know, RF Whiting Company, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4680.72s">according</a> to the mayor, was supposed to give the money for the dog park, and they never did. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4684.162s">And</a> now he's telling the people, you've got to raise the $200,000 if you really want this dog park. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4689.904s">He</a> knows how to raise money for everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4693.426s">It's</a> amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4695.047s">And</a> I think the good part is maybe, Mr. Clerk, if we have just a single number they can call the clerk's office, and maybe you should have a stack of petitions there if people come in, because that's where the licenses are as well, too, to pick up a license in your office. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4710.845s">I</a> can't generate the petitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4712.306s">No,</a> no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4713.427s">If</a> petitions are left in your office, if petitions are left in your office and somebody wants to come and pick them up, they can pick them up. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4719.731s">I</a> think that may be a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4723.553s">Central</a> point in the building.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4807.91s">President,</a> yesterday, well, I think it was yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4812.873s">I</a> got mine yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4813.733s">Other</a> people may have got it the day before. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4815.754s">We</a> all received in the mail our new water bill, and we also received a letter from the city indicating to the city of Medford water and sewer customers. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4826.601s">Now,</a> the letter is undated, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4829.036s">right</a> there in and of itself tends to indicate a lack of professionalism in the letter going out. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4837.779s">There</a> was no notice of a public meeting or an agenda item on this particular matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4843.801s">The</a> Medford City Council not only has talked about it, but at our April meeting of this year, we had a resolution that was offered by myself and passed by the seven members of the council to have the cemetery, no, excuse me, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4858.663s">The</a> Water and Soil Commission has appeared before the council and to explain this new idea of tiered rates and commercial rates or whatever it might be and however it's going to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4869.312s">And</a> that passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4870.793s">Unfortunately,</a> the mayor sends an answer back and says it's the council's purview. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4876.618s">I</a> mean, it's the Water and Soil Commission's purview to make that decision, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4881.141s">And</a> number two, this is a matter that involves the entire city for the purposes of being involved and getting involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4889.346s">The</a> council has asked on numerous occasions for the Water and Soil Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4893.609s">I</a> personally have met with the chairman of the Water and Soil Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4897.272s">I</a> asked him to come here. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4898.353s">We're</a> still waiting for him to come here. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4901.376s">The</a> mayor has never offered a public meeting or a hearing on this particular increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4907.22s">So</a> there is a complete lack of public education on this increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4911.664s">And</a> as a result of this, we have problems here. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4916.408s">Look</a> at your bill that just came out, and it talks about <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4920.526s">The</a> rates only apply to homes with up to four families and residential condo buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4926.05s">And</a> then it gives you a 0 to 800 as a base. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4929.493s">And</a> I don't know where they got that 800 as being the base. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4932.215s">Again,</a> no determination from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4934.196s">And</a> then from 800 cubic feet to 1,600 feet, you get to another rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4938.62s">And</a> it goes on. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4939.54s">And</a> after that, there's a third rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4941.222s">So</a> as a residential owner, you could have up to three types of rates in your particular house. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4946.646s">And</a> then it goes down further to indicate <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4949.122s">Every</a> other person or every other type of an account will be charged 0.138. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4954.786s">Now,</a> does that mean that that's going to be a commercial rate? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4960.309s">I</a> thought we were led to believe that there was going to be allegedly a commercial rate, which would be different than the regular rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4967.853s">But</a> if you go back to the first paragraph, they talk about they're adopting this in response to Chapter 165, Section 2B. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4972.836s">And</a> 165, Section 2B is very explicit <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4979.343s">where</a> it talks about, shall institute water charges and fees that incorporate a base rate for all, provided, which means other than or maybe, that said base rate shall be increased at an increased block rate to fairly reflect the resource demand and consumption of high volume uses of water. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5002.576s">Now</a> think about high volume uses of water. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5007.475s">If</a> you live in a three-family house, for the example that they use, you are a single person on the first floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5014.861s">There</a> is two, three people on the third floor, five or six people on the third floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5019.425s">And</a> they use the example you used, 2,100 units of water. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5023.068s">Well,</a> they're going to take the 2,100 units of water, divide it by three, and everybody's going to be tagged with 700 units of water to be charged. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5031.936s">That</a> doesn't make any sense at all, number one, because number one, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5036.306s">Not</a> everybody has a meter in their apartment. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5038.346s">And</a> if it's a single meter that's going to cover the whole house, some houses are like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5043.948s">I</a> mean, how do you distribute that? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5046.508s">I</a> mean, where they come up with this, I have absolutely no idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5050.969s">And</a> this is what prompted probably eight or nine of my 13 calls that I've already received so far in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5056.65s">How</a> do they make this type of a determination? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5058.751s">But</a> more importantly, personally, I think this is the mayor's way of retaliating against the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5064.619s">because</a> we didn't give him his $600,000 in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5067.981s">Bad</a> enough we didn't give him his parking garage. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5070.103s">And</a> as a result of that, this rate increase not only will pick up the $600,000, it'll probably exceed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5077.168s">Absolutely,</a> absolutely not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5080.15s">It</a> is not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5081.751s">At</a> the present time, people should be aware of the fact, at the present time, in our water and sewer retained earnings account, we have $8,400,000 as of today. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5096.533s">$8,400,000.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5098.275s">We</a> would have $9,600,000 if we didn't take a million two a few years ago to take the mayor out of his deficit hole because he couldn't balance the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5107.762s">But</a> with that being said, $8 million, that's a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5113.366s">And</a> we're talking about rate payers having to be charged right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5117.549s">There</a> is nothing in this letter that would even give you an assumption <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5122.301s">that</a> it's going to take place next year, or the next billing cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5125.963s">They</a> just jam it in the letter, and there it is in your new bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5131.046s">Now,</a> I went back, and to my knowledge, the last time in billing cycles in 2006, as compared to the bills that we have right now, the 2006 bill, sixth bill, tells you <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5144.895s">The</a> cost, it breaks it down for water and sewer, the cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5149.277s">Your</a> water and sewer cost is not broken down in these blue bills that we've been getting for a long period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5155.381s">And</a> as a result of that, I'm going to suggest in part, Mr. President, that the city's water and sewer department and the city of Medford building department reinstitute the prior building process that not only showed the prior readings, the present readings, the usage, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5173.311s">but</a> the rates for water and the rates for sewer per 100 cubic feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5177.955s">So</a> the people have an informed, knowledgeable bill, rather than getting a dollar amount and trying to figure out the hocus pocus that's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5187.281s">Baseline</a> water usage of 800, where do they get that? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5190.484s">I</a> have absolutely no idea who determined, and they don't even tell you where it came from. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5197.089s">The</a> bill, as I said before, it doesn't ID the water and sewer rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5200.435s">But</a> back and prior to 2006, it did. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5202.977s">It</a> gives you everything that you would want to know to try to figure out your bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5208.221s">Now,</a> your old rate consumption as compared to your new rate consumption, that's another thing that's not on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5214.767s">Because</a> all they're doing and they're telling you on the blue bill, it's just telling you what you had last time, what the reading was, and the amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5226.276s">And</a> once again, what's water, what's sewer, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5232.566s">I</a> think what really needs to be done on this particular issue is two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5237.55s">You</a> can't send out bills to people and just tell them it becomes effective now. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5243.555s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5244.315s">Number</a> two, you don't send out a letter that's undated. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5247.197s">Number</a> three, you don't turn around and tell, for an example, a three-family house, you're going to split it between the three floors, and everyone's going to pay the same amount on a per-unit charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5256.965s">You</a> don't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5258.806s">Second</a> of all, there's nothing on this bill <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5261.719s">on</a> this letter that talks about a commercial rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5266.141s">And</a> I think Councilor Marks, is he here? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5268.382s">I</a> think there was an issue relative to a commercial rate before. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5271.543s">You</a> know, where are we going with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5273.664s">It</a> says all other rates will be 0.1381. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5275.925s">And</a> that will be the same rate as someone who goes from the 800 to the 1600 level in a residential home. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5285.829s">I</a> said it before and I'll say it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5287.97s">If</a> families are going to be penalized because they have <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5291.272s">children</a> or mothers and fathers or seniors living with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5295.695s">That's</a> not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5297.036s">It's</a> absolutely not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5298.497s">And</a> as the law says, the resources should go on the demand and the consumption of high volume uses of water. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5307.063s">A</a> residential home, maybe just over this 800 level or whatever it might be, those aren't high uses of water. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5314.828s">That's</a> baseline wherever they got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5317.089s">Maybe</a> the zero to 800. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5318.769s">should</a> be maybe the $0 to $1,200 or $1,400, and then change it after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5323.911s">Because</a> I don't think it's bad enough rate payers, you're hitting them with a federal tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5327.672s">You</a> hit them with your state tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5329.013s">You</a> hit them with a meals tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5330.033s">You're</a> hitting them with a gas tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5331.614s">You</a> hit them with your real estate tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5333.494s">And</a> now you want to raise their water and sewer tax with an $8.4 million surplus sitting in a kitty. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5341.717s">It's</a> wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5343.358s">This</a> is not what the council asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5345.318s">I</a> believe this is the mayor's <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5347.443s">way</a> of getting back at the council because $600,000 was taken out of the budget for which the council voted for to knock off the 10% rate increase? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5357.691s">Well,</a> this rate increase is definitely going to exceed the 10% that the mayor was losing, or the $600,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5364.436s">And</a> who's going to pay for it? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5366.638s">It's</a> the everyday person. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5368.779s">I</a> would strongly suggest, Mr. President, once again, as we did in August, if the mayor says this is within the purview of the council, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5376.84s">Then</a> let it be in the purview and strike that respectfully request that the Board of Commissioners appear before the Medford City Council for the purposes of explaining not only the letter, but the rates as to where we're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5389.863s">And</a> also respectfully request that they change their billing process to accurately show the rate for water, the rate for sewer, where it's going, and the amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5400.945s">Now</a> with that being said, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5403.911s">I</a> can't find anyone, and I'm still waiting. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5405.872s">I</a> had a long talk today with Mr. Remsburg, who was the chief legal counsel for the MWRA. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5411.994s">And</a> in my conversation with him, which represented the same type of conversation I had with him in August of this past year, we're back to the same issue for which I believe we're on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5422.577s">The</a> bigger users, the demand for bigger users and demand for more consumption and high volume of users of water should be the first ones, according to this chapter of the law, to be paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5433.882s">It</a> says, all municipalities and water districts within the jurisdiction of the MWRA, but not including community service by the Connecticut Valley Aqueduct, shall institute water charges and fees that incorporate a base rate for all users. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5450.174s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5450.854s">They're</a> saying 800 is the base rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5453.176s">But</a> it says, provided that said base rate shall be increased at an increasing block rate to fairly recollect <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5461.909s">the</a> resources, demand, and consumption of high-volume uses of water. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5467.072s">If</a> somebody is 801, is they going to be tagged as a high-volume use of water? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5472.074s">Because</a> that person at 801, which could be residential, is going to be tagged at the same amount that everyone else is going to be tagged that's not residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5482.059s">And</a> you're going to have to assume it's commercial, because they don't say it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5484.741s">But</a> what is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5487.082s">Everybody</a> else but residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5488.703s">It's</a> got to be commercial. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5490.463s">So</a> with that being said, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5492.191s">I</a> think this needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5494.312s">I</a> think somebody needs to be here to address it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5496.474s">I</a> think the billing needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5498.215s">And</a> more importantly, I think it's absolutely unfair that somebody would put a, an increase in your bill on the same time that goes out with no public education, no public notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5511.223s">You</a> know, this is three strikes that the mayor has given to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5515.926s">He's</a> taking money away from people on cable access on Verizon and Comcast bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5521.547s">He's</a> sitting on $303,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5522.448s">It's</a> sitting downstairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5525.489s">He</a> just now signs, he just now signs a pay to park program that didn't have one public hearing here for the taxpayers to talk about and discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5534.955s">And</a> thirdly, he's now hitting you with a new tax on your water and sewer charge with no public input, no public information, no public hearing or anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5545.34s">That's</a> three strikes since the summer of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5549.028s">How</a> much more is it that the people of this community want to take? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5552.35s">When</a> are you going to realize that your open government is not open like you think it is? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5557.532s">And</a> your notorious government is as notorious as it can be, because there's no transparency as to what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5565.216s">This</a> letter should have been ID'd with a date, and it should have addressed itself DMF resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5572.16s">In</a> the near future, giving it the date, your bill will be going up the following, and it'll give the reason why. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5578.325s">But</a> the insanity of saying that a three-family or a two-family or a four-family house is going to be divided by the amount of units, and that's what they're going to pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5587.372s">They</a> have no right saying that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5588.413s">They</a> have no right doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5589.874s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I'm moving that our Board of Water and Soil Commissioners appear before the Medford City Council to discuss this particular matter.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5743.391s">I</a> hear what Councilor Knight is talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5746.032s">My</a> point of clarification is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5747.513s">While</a> he may be running off a string of resolutions, we had asked for a public hearing and a public meeting on this and for whatever <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5755.629s">the</a> Water and Soil Commissioners might have done or made the determination. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5759.652s">The</a> council has been asked to be apprised, and they've been asked to appear before here, and they never have. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5765.217s">So</a> 800 getting to the baseline, how did you get to it? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5769.16s">Where</a> did you come up with that number? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5770.961s">Because</a> if you look at a lot of the residential homes, they're going to be between 800 and that 1,600 mark. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5776.326s">So</a> by going over by one cubic feet, you're going to be putting that residential homeowner, who might have two or three kids or taking care of a senior citizen, paying a higher rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5786.059s">And</a> that's where I think the discussion needs to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5789.82s">I'm</a> not denying the fact that the more you use, the more you should pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5794.121s">But</a> this is a big gap from $800 to $800 to $1,600. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5798.603s">And</a> if you are just a little bit over that, you're going to be saddled with that additional thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5802.984s">And</a> again, as I said, if somebody has multiple people living in their family home, they're going to be penalized for using the water. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5809.005s">If</a> they use a dramatic amount, that's one thing.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5926.949s">Yeah,</a> clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5927.669s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5928.549s">I</a> hear what Councilor Knight is alluding to. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5930.53s">The</a> point is valid. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5932.711s">It</a> went from zero to 1,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5934.131s">Why</a> did it come down to 800? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5935.812s">Now,</a> if you speak to some of the members, they're going to turn around and tell you, this is part of the conservation mode of saving water and within families and stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5944.434s">Which</a> I wholeheartedly support. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5945.875s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5946.315s">But</a> I don't think anybody's going to deny the fact that, you know, you don't want to penalize people because they have people living in their homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5952.81s">who</a> might be seniors or elderly or babies or two or three children or for whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5958.957s">And</a> I would be not in favor of having a subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5963.002s">I</a> would be in favor of just having, calling for the public hearing and have them come in and explain it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5967.007s">They've</a> already mean what they did. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5969.149s">And</a> one point further, and I think as a Councilor, Councilor Marks, I think we had this conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5974.636s">Getting</a> to the point of the households, as Councilor Knight has just alluded to, how did you make this determination? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5981.902s">Where</a> are the numbers of those homes that are between 0 to 800, and from 800 to 1,600, and over that? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5989.069s">They</a> have to have statistics to do that, because if they just decided to go to 800 because it sounded good, because it was a good conservation move, well, that's not good. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5998.536s">If</a> there's people between 800 and 850, whatever it might be, there's nothing wrong with going to 1,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6002.859s">I</a> mean, that's a compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6004.199s">I</a> got no problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6005.56s">But</a> I want to see these numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6007.781s">I</a> want to see these numbers.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6033.314s">Thank</a> you for your point. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6034.315s">I</a> just remind councilor Dello Russo, one thing we had asked at one point in time, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6039.093s">to</a> have our city engineer appear before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6041.393s">And</a> she didn't come because the mayor told her not to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6043.934s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6044.474s">So</a> we can ask the Water and Soil Commissioners to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6047.995s">But</a> if they choose not to come because they're told not to come, where does that put the council?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6534.51s">Point</a> of clarification, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6536.29s">The</a> law says explicitly if the estimated income is more than the total appropriations, the excess shall be appropriated to a separate reserve fund and used for capital expenditures of the enterprise subject to the appropriation or to reduce user charges if authorized by the appropriate entity. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6554.602s">responsible</a> for operations of the enterprise.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6559.265s">He</a> can the law.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6561.047s">Absolutely.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6705.164s">Mr.</a> President, also the letter indicates further down that they're going to keep this baseline rate for the first year. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6711.988s">So</a> the intention is that they're going to be going up. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6714.749s">So</a> with that being said, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6716.6s">I'm</a> going to make the request that the Board of Water and Soil Commissioners appear before the Medford City Council to discuss this letter that went out that's unsigned, undated, as it represents, and that a new bill be forthcoming. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6735.186s">They</a> revised the bill that includes the rate for the water and the rate for the sewage. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6742.961s">and</a> along with the total amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6744.823s">Also,</a> the letter negates to put in here that it's nothing more than the new use. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6749.746s">They</a> don't have the old use by consumption and water and sewer charges. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6754.25s">And</a> I think that would be, once again, pure transparency for the rate payers at least to see what's going on other than, once again, just getting a letter saying, you know, this is what you're going to have to pay and your rates are going up and, you know, with no clarification, absolutely no education. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6769.241s">There</a> was absolutely nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6770.863s">You</a> notice that the mayor did not. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6772.885s">Listen,</a> the Board of Soil Commissioners worked for the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6775.266s">They're</a> his appointments on that board. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6777.208s">The</a> mayor owns this one as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6778.609s">This</a> is his responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6780.27s">If</a> he knew the rates were going up, for which they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6783.332s">And</a> if this is his end run to circumvent this council, because this council wouldn't give him his parking garage and wouldn't give him his $600,000 in the budget for 10% water rate increase, this is certainly the wrong way to go, especially with $8.4 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6799.722s">sitting</a> in the surplus account. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6801.564s">That</a> is just so wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6803.926s">You</a> know, you're ripping off the taxpayers once again, Mr. Mayor, knowing that their money is just sitting in an account to make you look good at a bond rating at the expense of the taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6816.956s">Maybe</a> they'd like to enjoy some of that money and spend it on their family or their kids or what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6822.481s">So</a> with that being said, I move the question, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6870.323s">I</a> can go either way because it's obvious that this has already been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6873.446s">From</a> the documents that I have secured from the Water and Sewer Commission, they've been talking about this since April of this past year with the city engineer and Mr. Woodcock, the MWRA, the legal counsel, and what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6884.707s">So</a> their determination has already been made. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6886.628s">My</a> question is going to be very simple and germane, basically what we had here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6890.209s">I</a> mean, the one thing, you know, they're saying that they cannot make the recommendation to reduce the water and sewer rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6899.713s">Well,</a> if they can't make the recommendation to reduce it, how can they make the recommendation to increase it? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6904.535s">It</a> doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6905.816s">The</a> law doesn't prohibit them from doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6907.916s">And</a> with an $8.4 million surplus, in the best interest of this community, <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6912.062s">It</a> would have been a wonderful exposure by the Water and Soil Commission to recommend to the mayor that we not increase and we take this out of the Water and Soil account. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6920.269s">But</a> as we all know, this is the mayor's board, and they're going to do whatever the mayor tells them to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6924.793s">So</a> I can go either way on the resolution.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6994.682s">Councilor</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6995.722s">On</a> the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6996.202s">I</a> got no problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6999.349s">We</a> only have three more meetings between now and we're off for two. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7002.271s">So</a> I would request that this meeting take place within the next two to three week, next two to three meetings that were available. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7008.496s">But</a> in the meantime, if we could have some information forwarded to us so we could at least know the proposed that they're giving us here, how they got to this baseline of 800, if we could get some information on how they got to that, if we get some information ahead of time, once again, what's the old rate compared to the new rates? <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7029.825s">And</a> something as it relates to, you know, revising the bill that includes the water rates for water and sewer usage and the dollar amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7039.671s">So</a> at least when somebody gets it, they could figure it out rather than just getting numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7044.033s">Then</a> the conversation on that particular night would just basically, you know, figure out the tiered rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7051.158s">This</a> lacks the word commercial rate in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7054.219s">It</a> says all other, all other establishments. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7059.485s">which</a> I'm assuming is going to be commercial. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7062.327s">We'll</a> find that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7063.709s">So</a> if we could have that and a roll call vote.<h2><a href="../2013-06-05_LlmLze0ItRE/2013-06-05_LlmLze0ItRE.html">May 28, 2013 City Council of Medford, Massachusetts Full upload of complete council meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=114.915s">On</a> that motion, Councilor Dello Russo's amendment, we just got a notice I think today relative to a meeting that's going to take place on June 3rd by the folks that are doing the work over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=125.444s">So</a> that may be something you may want to bring up for the purpose of letting them pay to do the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=132.649s">So</a> it's in your, pardon me? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=134.09s">You</a> want to amend that further? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=134.891s">Yeah,</a> amend it further, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=137.383s">Why</a> don't you repeat that again? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=138.705s">The</a> amendment is that the Department of Transportation is having a public meeting on June 3rd. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=142.97s">I</a> believe it's in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=144.432s">We</a> got a notice today in our emails. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=146.474s">There's</a> one of six locations, that's the next one coming up, and that will make reference to Councilor Camuso's and Councilor De La Rosa's thoughts relative to Medford Street.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=869.451s">On</a> that motion, could we get a copy of where the <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=875.071s">Dog</a> packs and the amount of money was supposed to be coming from October of 2011. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=879.395s">The</a> mayor made a public announcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=883.058s">We've</a> been talking about dog packs since 2011, because that was supposed to have been part of the mitigation that F.W. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=889.884s">White,</a> or J.F. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=890.605s">White,</a> was supposed to be giving the city of Medford for the FAST-14. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=893.847s">So</a> we've never seen the dog pack. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=896.169s">Could</a> we just get the handle on what that mitigation terminology was on dog packs? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=901.957s">$50,000.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=902.077s">I</a> have no idea.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1230.836s">Mr.</a> President last Tuesday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1232.357s">Um,</a> I thought we had a very informative conversation and after I went back and I reviewed the tape, um, I, I, I think to some degree we will mislead or at least I was misled because I asked the question as a related is the new location on Salem street going to have the capacity <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1249.502s">to</a> do a broadcast from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1251.983s">And</a> the answer was yes from the manager of the station. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1257.945s">Now,</a> subsequent to that, immediately following the meeting, the transmission of the module, or whatever you want to call the terminology, was in the corner of the room over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1267.888s">And</a> the conversation finally alluded to the fact that on Riverside Avenue, there is absolutely no Comcast, and there is no Verizon capacity to do broadcasting or to bring cable in. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1279.687s">Now,</a> if you remember correctly, Mr. President, it was you who brought up this issue, I think some five to seven years ago, relative to a business client on High Street who was trying to get Comcast, I think, or Verizon, into the building over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1295.113s">It</a> was Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1296.774s">And</a> at that point in time, I believe there was, in our conversation, I believe we had someone from Channel 3, and I don't know who, so I don't want to mention any names. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1308.291s">because</a> I'd be absolutely wrong, but I remember somebody from Channel 3 indicating that that was one of the problems that we had in Medford Square, the inability or the lack of capacity to have broadcasting in the downtown Medford Square area, which seems to be pretty kind of evident. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1320.658s">Now,</a> again, from the conversation that took place last Tuesday night and from the information that was ascertained, there is a two-year contract signed, I believe, at 32 Salem Street, Riverside Avenue, excuse me, <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1333.507s">There's</a> no Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1334.348s">There's</a> no Verizon there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1336.109s">So</a> how do you broadcast out of have a full-fledged studio if you don't have that capacity to broadcast from there? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1343.775s">So</a> what's going on now, if I understand all of this correctly, is the modular transmission, lack of terminology. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1350.441s">I</a> don't know the proper terminology. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1352.362s">But</a> it's here in this particular building, or it was brought here in this particular building. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1357.406s">I</a> don't know if it's still here. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1358.902s">And</a> the whole idea is that the transmission would come from Verizon or Comcast to City Hall, and then they would somehow bounce it to 32 Riverside Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1369.727s">And</a> I'm saying to myself, well, wait a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1371.308s">What</a> is this all about? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1373.629s">This</a> is not having a full-fledged studio that's equipped on its own merits at its own location. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1379.251s">Then</a> I started to think about this thing even more. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1380.952s">And</a> I'm saying to myself, we have a concern here. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1384.054s">We're</a> putting channel-free equipment into Medford City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1387.915s">And</a> by putting Channel 3 equipment into Medford City Hall, are we talking about having a liability issue here? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1393.379s">Are</a> we talking about the equipment here in City Hall? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1395.881s">Are</a> we talking about the access to City Hall? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1398.062s">The</a> keys and who would have keys to City Hall? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1400.184s">Who</a> would be coming into City Hall if, in fact, something were to go wrong in the transmission from City Hall to 32 Riverside Avenue? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1408.009s">And</a> there's a whole host of questions here. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1409.471s">And</a> the city has a liability policy as it relates to being a self-insured. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1413.433s">Now,</a> we all know that Channel 3 is a separate private nonprofit corporation. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1417.611s">So,</a> I mean, we have two separate entities here running around. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1421.674s">We</a> were also told at that point in time that there was, I believe, less than $100,000 operating budget that they were operating in, but there is another budget for whatever that might be worth. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1434.682s">So</a> I tried to get down there on two separate occasions on Riverside Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1437.624s">Both</a> times I couldn't get in. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1438.845s">Both</a> times the door was locked, but on one particular day, <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1442.022s">The</a> paper was down, I did have a chance to look in, and it didn't look like there was hardly any work, if any work at all was taking place down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1447.724s">Now</a> this goes back to March of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1450.345s">So</a> now we have a station manager that's getting paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1452.586s">We</a> have no transmission, no broadcasting coming forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1455.628s">We</a> have, for whatever the reason might be, if in fact the city of Medford is now being a part of whatever Channel 3 is going to be involved with, if the mayor is doing this, I have no idea why Channel 3 would even be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1467.031s">and</a> entertaining City Hall, but more importantly, why would they even want to stay on Riverside Avenue with no access to cable television, Verizon or Comcast? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1477.038s">You</a> know, poor choice, they've been around, they know the situation, they know what Medford Square is about, they know what Riverside Ave is all about, and that was a poor choice to go there, especially being in the business for, they're not novice, these people that are working there, and they're a part of Channel 3, they've been around for a while, they know what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1495.424s">And</a> since they know what's going on, the sad part about this is they've got themselves locked into a contract for which I would assume, I would hope that they would be able to get out of. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1503.169s">And</a> even if they had to get sued, who cares about getting sued? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1506.211s">Look</a> at the time that you're costing the city, the taxpayers, each of the rate payers, each and every cable bill are paying for something. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1512.096s">You're</a> paying for station manager that has no job to do because there's nothing being programmed. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1516.038s">There's</a> nothing being taped. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1517.878s">And</a> then it dawned on me yesterday while we were at the cemetery and we were listening to the speeches being made and watching the people that were there and the observance, where is all this portable equipment? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1528.108s">The</a> portable equipment that Channel 3 has had through the years from the thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars that subscribers have not only paid, but the city of Medford has transferred over to Channel 3 through the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1541.872s">They</a> could have had people out there with portable cameras doing the portable televising of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1546.456s">And</a> then, if in fact, and when they do come back on, that they would have a whole host of things to put on, the Memorial Day service, graduations, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1555.763s">You</a> don't see any of that around. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1557.825s">And</a> then we were told there's 10 board of directors. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1559.627s">I</a> have no idea who the board of directors are, and I would hope they would come forward and let us know who these board of directors are so we could get a handle on what the makeup of the board is. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1569.206s">And</a> then, I believe one of the situations that came up, going back and reviewing Judge Jackson's report, that the city paid over $15,000 on, Melanson and Heath, the city's auditor, on one particular year, going back, I believe it was just before or after Judge Jackson, indicated there was, on a $15,000 account, $5,000 was totally unaccounted for. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1587.324s">No</a> receipts, no records, totally unaccounted for. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1593.157s">Now</a> I know I see one of the folks sitting in the audience, I don't know which one it is, but I know he came to the podium one night and he said it was a combination of sloppy bookkeeping, not keeping the records accurate, but we're going to do a better job and all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1606.01s">Well,</a> our resolution last week was to ask for an audit, a complete audit on channel three for the last three years and have that forwarded to the city because the rate payers really have no other alternative. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1617.708s">but</a> to either go to the mirror. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1618.928s">And</a> it's obvious that the mirror is either failing to do anything, doesn't want to do anything, afraid to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1624.93s">So</a> the people's voice, which is at this podium right now, is nothing more than asking, what is really going on over there? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1632.052s">You</a> know, why would you want to put a TV station for cable subscribers for public access at a location that has no accessibility to the cable? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1643.836s">That's</a> number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1644.636s">Number</a> two, why wasn't that thought out ahead of time <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1647.216s">to</a> know that cable access could not go there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1649.578s">And</a> number three, more importantly, you know, they should go out and find another spot and think about what really cable access is here within this community and what it should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1658.265s">Because</a> the taxpayers and the rate payers, as Councilor Caraviello alluded to last Tuesday night, they're getting ripped off each and every month. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1664.65s">There</a> should be an accounting for that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1666.211s">There</a> should be a credit coming back. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1667.952s">And</a> the City of Medford should not be holding that money available for Channel 3 if they're not broadcasting. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1672.984s">People</a> are getting paid for doing no work, because there's no work to be done over there, and there's no broadcasting. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1678.367s">So,</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I think we really need to get an answer from our city solicitor as it relates to, is the city of Medford using a public building for the purposes of having transmission out of this building to 32 Riverside Avenue for the purposes of having public access cable television? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1697.556s">And</a> if that's the case, what is, if any, legal ramifications that might be involved? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1702.605s">Let's</a> go back to the other issue, Mr. Clark, who comes into the building, who's going to handle the phone calls, who's going to have a set of keys, who's going to be responsible for the equipment, who's going to be responsible for the city's equipment, who's going to be responsible for what's in this building if somebody from Channel 3 or one of their designees comes into this building for whatever the reasons might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1722.009s">That's</a> the sad part about not having this all in one place with the ability to be <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1727.66s">accessed</a> in and out of one place. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1729.661s">And</a> to come here in City Hall now, after the fact, having whatever the tenure was in 5 High Street, whatever that lawsuit might be all about, whatever the reason why they left there, it doesn't make any sense that they would go to another place that gives them less opportunity for the purposes of broadcasting on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1747.69s">On</a> motion to Councilor Penta, Vice President Del Russo.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2051.672s">While</a> you might be autonomous legally, <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2054.366s">You</a> are taking ratepayers' money for which the mayor of this community overrides your corporation, because he administers Channel 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2062.451s">He's</a> the executive director, and technically, of your Channel 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2066.413s">But</a> he's not taking any action for whatever the reason is. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2069.615s">So</a> you feel as though it's your duty to go ahead and take action? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2073.017s">It's</a> my duty to let the taxpayer, ratepayer know that that Channel 3 is not operating. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2077.64s">It</a> should be operating. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2078.941s">And</a> there is something wrong, especially when you're bringing equipment into this building <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2082.574s">and</a> trying to make the modular or the transmission go from here to there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2085.695s">Why</a> didn't you just go to another place that had access?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2095.757s">There's</a> nothing to be confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2096.838s">Don't</a> play the game tonight, Frank. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2098.018s">The</a> bottom line is you're in a place that you had no right going to because there was no access, and you've taken two months worth of ratepayers' money that they're paying each and every <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2105.993s">You're</a> paying people at work that have no job to go to.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2109.595s">No,</a> let me give you the history. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2111.036s">The</a> history is this, Frank. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2112.417s">Frank,</a> Frank, the history is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2115.719s">He</a> hasn't earned my respect, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2117.7s">Well,</a> you haven't earned mine either.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2120.801s">That's</a> on Riverside Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2121.982s">You're</a> in a place that does not have access to cable, Verizon, or Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2126.124s">You're</a> not operating, and the tax rate payers in this community are not getting their money's worth. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2130.267s">That's</a> the bottom line. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2131.567s">That's</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2132.688s">So</a> why did you go there? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2133.729s">Answer</a> that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2134.749s">Why</a> did you go to a place knowing that there was no access?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2159.226s">Well,</a> who are the board of directors? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2160.887s">He</a> said there was 10 of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2161.928s">Do</a> you know the 10 of them? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2162.849s">Who</a> said there were 10? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2164.45s">Mr.</a> Sano, your director.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2167.392s">Well,</a> that's what he said. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2168.272s">He</a> told us they were 10.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2176.316s">Let</a> me give a little history. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2177.676s">Let</a> me give a little history. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2179.197s">Mr.</a> Poleri, Mr. Poleri, Mr. Poleri, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2183.259s">Mr.</a> Poleri, how many board of directors do you have?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2189.481s">No,</a> how many do you have right now, active? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2191.803s">I</a> want to say six. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2192.844s">You</a> have six. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2193.885s">So</a> your station manager was wrong when he said 10.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2201.17s">Well,</a> that's what he said, 10.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2213.358s">No,</a> I don't want any history. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2214.619s">Mr.</a> President, we're not here. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2216.16s">That's</a> not the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2217.438s">The</a> resolution's not about a history of TV3 to dance around the subject. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2220.52s">The</a> subject matter is very simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2222.221s">The</a> rate payers have no one to go to, because the mayor is not doing anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2225.843s">So</a> when they come to a council or a council law— Well, that's for you to discuss with the mayor, isn't it?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2232.547s">Yes,</a> it is.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2235.549s">You</a> may be autonomous in your mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2237.851s">In</a> your mind, you might be autonomous. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2239.673s">But</a> you are using ratepayers' money. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2244.817s">You're</a> taking ratepayers' money that the mayor is giving to you because of the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2249.942s">But</a> you have no access. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2251.083s">There's</a> no television. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2252.123s">There's</a> no broadcasting. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2253.625s">You're</a> paying for people that don't have a job to go to for two months plus more. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2257.008s">Tell</a> me. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2261.209s">Yeah,</a> I'm really serious.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2292.695s">Point</a> of information, I wanna know why you're not broadcasting it on Riverside Avenue.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2297.979s">Answer</a> it, I don't want a long history, just tell me the reason why. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2300.34s">All</a> right, go ahead, go ahead with your statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2301.901s">What's</a> your answer?

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2379.874s">If</a> you're having issues at 5 High Street.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2401.104s">You</a> went there knowing it didn't have it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2473.079s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2475.66s">Why</a> did you bring your transmitter over here last week and have it stored here? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2478.421s">Because</a> you were going to transmit here and then from here it's going to bounce back there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2481.123s">Why'd</a> you do that?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2495.953s">So</a> you cannot broadcast legitimately on your own at 32 Riverside Avenue? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2500.315s">That's</a> not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2501.795s">Forget</a> City Hall.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2505.557s">You</a> cannot do it, Frank. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2507.118s">You</a> just got through saying there's a feed here, which is going to allow you to broadcast them there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2512.14s">You</a> cannot go to 32 Riverside Avenue on its own without City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2516.002s">You</a> need City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2516.722s">That's</a> the bottom line.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2530.495s">So</a> why don't you just go someplace that had cable accessibility?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2554.466s">Councilman</a> Iacocca, so a few years ago, five, six years ago, brought up that issue, and your people were here one night when we had a discussion on how Cable Comcast was being broadcast, and as a matter of fact, it went all the way to Haines Square, and it was a business person. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2568.589s">Remember,</a> who's the person?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2572.8s">My</a> belief is Riverside Avenue going up to High Street is not wired. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2576.904s">Was</a> not wired.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2590.278s">You</a> mentioned High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2591.579s">That's</a> what I said.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2595.48s">Well,</a> you weren't specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2596.8s">You</a> said High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2597.92s">Excuse</a> me. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2598.34s">Five</a> High Streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2599.161s">Bottom</a> line is you're wasting taxpayers' money, ratepayers' money by being in a place, you're not broadcasting, there's nothing going on over there, you're paying a station manager and one other person for nothing.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2612.344s">There</a> is nothing going on for him.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2614.565s">There</a> isn't.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2629.393s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President, have you got any legal opinion from a city solicitor as it relates to the liability, if anything, and how this is all going to work? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2637.958s">Have</a> you discussed this with the city solicitor? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2639.919s">I</a> have a meeting tomorrow with the mayor and the solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2642.701s">So</a> in other words, you're going ahead, making an assumption over here by going into construction and spending money, but you haven't met with the city manager, I mean, the mayor and the solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2652.727s">So</a> you went ahead, ahead of time, two months ago, going in there, and now you just decide to go to the city solicitor.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2661.27s">Why</a> is it inaccurate? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2662.431s">You</a> just said you're meeting tomorrow.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2670.279s">So</a> the Mayor has given you his blessing to put your equipment in this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2673.543s">Is</a> that what you're saying? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2674.224s">That's</a> essentially correct, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2676.426s">The</a> Mayor of Medford said to you, Frank Palleri, Board of Directors at Channel 3, you can put your <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2682.645s">your</a> equipment here and broadcast from here to that studio.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2714.261s">Point</a> of further information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2717.403s">You</a> just used the word, hopefully. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2720.805s">Give</a> the same services, hopefully. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2722.886s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2723.459s">The</a> word hopefully should never have even been used. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2725.82s">It</a> should have been able to say, to provide the same services, period.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2741.247s">But</a> to get here and there, you keep saying here and there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2744.348s">City</a> Hall is supposed to be a part of this.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2749.673s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2752.556s">No,</a> I just think there's a liability issue here and I think there's an issue that the city needs to address.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2769.069s">Don't</a> tell me what I know.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2771.671s">Grandstanding?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2772.331s">This</a> is you. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2772.792s">This</a> is what you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2773.532s">This</a> is what you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2775.073s">You</a> coming up here and making a big example of what? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2779.716s">The</a> bottom line. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2780.177s">So</a> let me go ahead and give a step. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2781.378s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2789.771s">Point</a> of further information, Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2792.717s">You</a> keep saying you're in the process of building what? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2795.563s">You</a> don't have the ability to transmit out of there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2798.429s">What</a> are you building?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2806.338s">If</a> you can't transmit from the internet.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2815.084s">I</a> don't care about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2816.325s">I</a> care about- How do you think they transmit over- Keep your voice down, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2819.507s">I</a> care about Channel 3 and the subscribers paying for the money.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2931.302s">You</a> know, if you're going to have this ability to come into this building because your equipment is here, what do you expect the city to do if you have to come in here <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2942.455s">and</a> the building is closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2944.517s">Do</a> you expect to get keys to the city?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2987.134s">City</a> Hall closes at 12.30 on a Friday, you have Monday through Friday, so if God forbid something had happened, you'd be down all weekend, whereas if you were in a location, <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2996.087s">where</a> all your equipment was there, somebody could get in, it could be serviced within an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3000.097s">Again,</a> this does not make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3002.182s">Staying</a> in a place. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3003.706s">staying</a> in a place that does not give you access. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3006.348s">And</a> you have to do a habit.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3012.031s">No,</a> you're being ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3014.492s">You</a> went to 5 High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3015.613s">You</a> didn't have to get another place at 5 High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3018.094s">You</a> didn't have to get another place at Canal Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3019.975s">You</a> didn't have to get another place at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3022.016s">This</a> is the only one. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3023.017s">This</a> is your fourth move. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3023.917s">And</a> on the fourth move, you need another place to put your equipment.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3028.04s">Yeah,</a> it really bothers me. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3029.04s">Why</a> does that bother you, Councilor? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3029.921s">It</a> bothers me because it doesn't belong here. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3031.222s">It</a> belongs in the place that you're renting, that you're taking the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3034.004s">You</a> took the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3034.865s">You</a> took the money from the ratepayers of this community to have a public access channel.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3046.893s">Yeah,</a> I remember it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3049.234s">That's</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3049.534s">The</a> vote was four to three. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3050.334s">You</a> know why?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3077.837s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3078.138s">He's</a> just going to keep repeating the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3079.518s">So</a> I'm going to go to another question. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3081.059s">Your</a> station manager last week said he has a budget of $100,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3084.501s">You</a> have a separate budget that's doing all that work down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3087.243s">How</a> much is that budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3088.624s">What</a> is that costing? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3090.545s">Excuse</a> me. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3091.665s">What</a> does that cost?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3101.69s">No,</a> no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3102.291s">He</a> indicated that there's two separate budgets. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3104.392s">One</a> is an operating budget, one's a- Well, we have an operating budget and a capital budget, sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3108.776s">So</a> what's paying for that, operating or capital?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3160.43s">Last</a> question, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3161.951s">Last</a> week, because your station manager couldn't answer the question, so maybe you can answer it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3166.034s">When's</a> the last time you've been audited? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3168.518s">Did</a> you give him an opportunity to answer the question last night? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3171.019s">Yes,</a> I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3171.319s">He</a> said he didn't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3173.56s">No,</a> not an audit. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3175.981s">You</a> filed your report to the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3177.621s">I'm</a> talking about an audit.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3196.356s">You're</a> the station manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3197.677s">You</a> have your money managers over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3199.799s">They</a> should know.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3203.222s">You're</a> the president? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3204.063s">I</a> am the president of the corporation. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3205.024s">And</a> how long have you been there, Frank? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3206.665s">I've</a> been affiliated with TV3 since 1986. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3208.608s">Well</a> then, from 1987 to this particular time, you should have a pretty good idea how a station runs and what they're responsible for and what to do.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3217.962s">I</a> have a lot better idea than you and some other people in this room. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3220.706s">I</a> just asked you the question then. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3222.609s">The</a> last time you think was three to four years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3225.092s">Three</a> to four years ago, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3227.194s">That's</a> not an answer in your world?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3239.927s">So</a> you didn't adhere to Judge Jackson's report and her findings. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3243.1s">Apparently</a> you didn't follow her recommendations.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3259.068s">Well,</a> that's a very interesting comment to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3261.049s">The</a> city pays $15,000.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3277.139s">So</a> you're saying that city solicitor Rumley, he hurled car bombs at you too? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3282.002s">Is</a> that what you're saying? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3283.803s">No</a> comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3284.524s">Yeah,</a> no comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3285.224s">I</a> guess so, huh? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3286.465s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3287.405s">Councilor</a> Caraviello.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3440.86s">What</a> was that remark supposed to mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3443.561s">Well,</a> it was just a little fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3444.741s">No,</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3445.041s">What's</a> that supposed to mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3446.081s">Lighten</a> up, dear boy. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3447.002s">No,</a> I'm not going to lighten up. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3448.382s">I'm</a> serious about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3449.862s">You</a> think I'm going to go in there and take your equipment?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3455.583s">What</a> are you talking about? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3456.443s">I</a> didn't hurl any accusations. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3457.243s">You</a> would take offense to that? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3458.144s">I</a> didn't hurl any. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3458.644s">I</a> just made comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3459.564s">I</a> didn't hurl anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3460.544s">I</a> didn't point the finger at anyone that was doing anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3463.044s">I</a> asked questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3463.945s">Is</a> that right? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3464.465s">Yes,</a> that's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3465.165s">Is</a> that right? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3465.665s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3466.165s">Well,</a> what about this missing money? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3468.045s">You</a> tell me about it.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3469.866s">There's</a> no money missing.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3472.526s">Well,</a> then, Senator Heath, read its report.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3491.212s">Frank</a> Leary was right. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3492.192s">If</a> that's the case, Frank, I would be more than happy to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3494.554s">But</a> when your money managers say that you people keep sloppy bookkeeping records, I have to find out. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3500.078s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3500.278s">Point</a> of information, Vice President Del Russo.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3705.333s">Now,</a> with... Point of information, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3709.876s">You</a> guys get $200,000 a year from the subscribers of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3715.38s">$200,000</a> a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3715.96s">And</a> you're telling me you cannot afford to have an annual audit on your books? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3720.864s">That's</a> right, yeah.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3741.962s">And</a> they do more, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3742.922s">And</a> as a matter of fact, they go before the legislative body almost quarterly to explain what they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3748.767s">the</a> programs that they're presenting, and they tell them about their income levels.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3769.151s">We</a> have, and he hasn't responded. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3770.551s">That's</a> why we're discussing it right here.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3779.774s">He's</a> not the only proper authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3781.294s">We</a> represent the people of this community, and we represent cable TV subscribers. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3786.237s">Now,</a> if you folks want to come here and give your sales pitch, you go right ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3789.879s">They</a> can hear you, and they can hear any one of us.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3813.746s">Where</a> am I getting my information?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3816.948s">Wait</a> a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3817.889s">No,</a> you just made a comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3819.55s">Yes,</a> I did, Mr. Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3820.43s">Who</a> am I getting and where am I getting my information from? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3822.972s">You</a> don't think I have the ability to do this on my own? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3824.633s">Is</a> that what you're trying to say? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3826.57s">You</a> think I'm somebody else's mouthpiece?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3833.863s">I'm</a> not going to stand here and listen to that nonsense. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3836.006s">All</a> right.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3918.209s">All</a> right, Councilor Panta. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3919.07s">One</a> last question. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3920.13s">You</a> may have won the award, but so didn't 10 other communities win the award, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3923.851s">So</a> you weren't the only community. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=3925.252s">We</a> won the National Excellence Award.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4112.193s">On</a> that motion, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4114.574s">If</a> I understand how the motion just did not pass, I understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4119.757s">So</a> the question then becomes of the mayor, that the mayor should be reporting back to the council that he is allowing Channel 3, he should update this council, that he is now allowing Channel 3 to house and use this building for the purposes of supplementing
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4212.754s">First</a> Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4213.875s">Mr.</a> President, I'm thankful that Councilor Lingo-Curran now has added on to the resolution in thought and in practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4221.44s">What</a> we have here is a whole host of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4224.005s">As</a> we had our discussion tonight relative to the pool issue, the bottom line to all of this is the mayor says everything is a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4231.849s">Well,</a> everything cannot be a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4233.75s">Taxpayers</a> in this community are going to wind up paying for everything that's a priority in the mayor's mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4238.532s">We</a> have a police yard. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4239.552s">We</a> have a fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4240.993s">We</a> have public works. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4242.374s">We</a> have whatever the heck is going on on Commercial Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4245.235s">I</a> don't know how much longer that's going to last. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4249.237s">We</a> still haven't even resolved the issue <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4251.573s">of</a> the girls or the ladies or the women, however you want to use the terminology in the police department, you know, the locker rooms or the lack of locker rooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4259.505s">and</a> the safety issues that need to be revolved over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4263.868s">We</a> never even got to the point of the Water and Sewer Department after the fire in May of three years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4268.872s">They</a> were supposed to get a trailer. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4270.013s">They</a> never even got a trailer. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4272.334s">I</a> mean, these things go on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4274.336s">I</a> mean, we have a swimming pool that's now going to get us well up to almost $3,800,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4277.418s">It</a> started off as a $2.3 million adventure. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4279.119s">So</a> I just don't think the taxpayers of this city <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4286.238s">should</a> be led to believe, oh, we can afford it, we can afford it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4289.079s">What</a> can we afford? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4289.9s">Every</a> time you slap a dollar on the price tag of all of this stuff, somebody has to pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4295.943s">Now,</a> there's no conversation anymore about the no-interest loans that the MWRA had. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4300.625s">I</a> don't know whatever happened to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4301.966s">We</a> never heard anything more about, you know, the money that was supposed to be coming forward from the billboards and all of that to appropriate this money. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4309.73s">So,</a> I really think, Mr. President, before any votes take place, <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4315.07s">Any</a> agreements take place on any one of these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4317.973s">We</a> really need to, if the mayor doesn't want to put it in some kind of an order of priority, then maybe the council should, between and amongst ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4325.899s">Maybe</a> we all feel that the public works department is more important than the pool, or maybe the police department is more important than the pool, or the pool is more important than the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4334.727s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4335.467s">But</a> there's only so much money that we have to go out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4337.91s">And</a> you have a budget coming up right around the corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4340.231s">And</a> as Councilor Lungelkorn alluded to before, <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4342.515s">And</a> as Councilor Marks also alluded to, we should have these figures before this budget even comes into place so we have some kind of an idea how much this is gonna cost and where we're going with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4356.882s">You</a> talk to the rate payer, the taxpayer on the street, all they know is the cost of everything just keeps going up and up and up. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4363.726s">And</a> the cost of government keeps going up too. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4366.327s">And</a> I think we saw a pure example of it tonight <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4368.686s">on</a> Channel 3 coming down here. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4370.167s">To</a> me, it's total incompetence. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4371.928s">They</a> did not want to address or discuss the issue regarding ratepayers' money. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4376.111s">At</a> least we can discuss taxpayers' money. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4379.073s">And</a> at least we have some semblance of controlling of what's going on in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4383.597s">Unfortunately,</a> on the cable TV subscribers, why the mayor is refusing to get involved to do anything, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4390.882s">Maybe</a> they have a tie over him over something, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4393.624s">But</a> it's absolutely wrong as to what's going on over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4396.286s">But</a> more importantly, at least on this particular issue, <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4398.683s">We</a> have some control over it, and we have the control of either saying yes, no, or maybe, or cut it in between, and maybe it's not as grandiose as it appears to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4407.668s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4408.548s">Councilor</a> Longo-Kurin.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4891.449s">At</a> the meeting tonight, there were two papers that were handled of updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4894.93s">I</a> think you got one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4897.071s">Oh.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4897.391s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4897.751s">And</a> I think all the council should get copies of them.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4909.658s">And</a> there was another two-page one that they had given out.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7773.444s">Joseph</a> Pierre.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7779.729s">Is</a> that your brother?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7780.87s">Joseph</a> O. No, he's Joseph O. Joseph O. Pierre. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7784.573s">I</a> get a page here from the Sailor of Weights and Measures. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7787.535s">It's</a> unsigned and undated. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7790.217s">As</a> a matter of fact, both of his pages are unsigned and undated.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7798.664s">Mr.</a> Clark, they're unsigned and undated.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7831.107s">You're</a> using Friday Canal Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7833.248s">What's</a> Harvard Street?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7839.513s">What's</a> your company?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7850.86s">You</a> have two different names.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7857.179s">You</a> have two different corporations?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7865.245s">All</a> County Transportation, Inc.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7872.09s">You</a> have one cab already right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7874.232s">What's</a> the name of that cab company?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7884.711s">I</a> don't understand this. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7885.532s">If</a> you want three cabs, why do you have two different cab company names?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7909.553s">How</a> could you be paying $600 a month if you didn't get the license?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7915.807s">The</a> insurance? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7916.507s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7917.348s">Insurance</a> for what?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7921.79s">You</a> paid $7,200 a year? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7923.23s">$7,200</a> a year, that's what you pay for insurance?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7926.112s">But</a> you don't have a cab license. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7927.632s">How</a> could you be paying that?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7971.937s">You</a> are self-insured $10,000 for each car. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7974.438s">That's</a> what you're saying? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7975.698s">Yes,</a> most of the cabins are self-insured. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7977.819s">You</a> put $20,000 up to insure two cars.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7982.541s">You</a> just got through saying you're paying $600 a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7984.202s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7984.322s">Current</a> insurance.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8034.442s">Is</a> your other taxi self-insured too?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8100.859s">I</a> don't possibly can believe that you need two more cabs to operate in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8108.503s">You</a> already have one. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8109.223s">That's</a> 44 cabs. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8111.504s">I</a> just cannot believe there is no <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8115.354s">There's</a> no business out there for 44 cabs in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8119.617s">I</a> just don't understand this.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8125.701s">I</a> understand that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8129.844s">I</a> don't know if you're from a court or what, but I can't support it because I just think this is completely out of control. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8135.023s">All</a> of it's out of control. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8136.524s">You</a> don't even have your own certificate of insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8138.845s">You</a> write self-insured. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8140.246s">The</a> Commonwealth of Massachusetts tells you you have to have a stamped self-insured certificate when you're using the term self-insured.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8247.443s">That</a> Mr. Ramirez be invited down, who was a wonderful asset, <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8250.635s">at</a> the Brookline Bank and he just retired. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8253.516s">And</a> it'd be nice to have the people take a look and see and have him give us his resume.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8296.098s">Two</a> papers. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8296.598s">13-449.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8298.786s">It</a> was laid in the table on the 14th. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8301.868s">Um,</a> DPW parks department and Hormel commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8305.79s">We</a> get a report back on that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8309.151s">No,</a> but he laid it for one week.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8314.134s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8361.026s">Why</a> can't it be open all the time? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8362.147s">I</a> don't understand that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8367.41s">Why</a> can't they be open, like, on Saturday and Sunday when they go? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8369.391s">It</a> should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8370.191s">That's</a> what I'm asking for.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8372.432s">I</a> know.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8381.197s">What,</a> on the track? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8381.898s">I</a> was just talking about the track, to walk around the track.

 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1818.172s">Councilor</a> Pater, the motion for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1820.153s">I</a> think it's very unfair that Mr. Wood came to this podium <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1823.528s">and</a> virtually attacked a city councilor on a resolution that is nothing more than a result of numerous, because we all received them, numerous resolutions of public safety issues in this community, whether it's signage, crosswalks, intersection, lights, speeding, not enough police protection at certain places. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1847.078s">I</a> think maybe Mr. Wood didn't get the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1849.3s">I</a> don't think he understood the fact that Councilor Marks, in his resolution, did talk about pedestrian safety, did talk about bicycle paths. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1857.107s">He</a> made references to a long-term approach, and in this long-term approach would be inclusive, I would assume, of all the things that Mr. Wood would want to be talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1867.296s">The</a> unfortunate part about it is you can't win in this council, because when you put a resolution, this isn't even my resolution, I don't even know why I'm talking about it, but I will talk about it, because it's one of my colleagues, and if I agree with one of my colleagues, I'll support it, if I disagree, I won't support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1881.906s">But</a> I support it only for one reason, because we all have been inundated over the last few months from resolutions of people throughout this community who just get absolutely no satisfaction from this administration on their issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1897.499s">I</a> have to assume that part of this resolution smacks with a sense of frustration because we are at a, this council as a whole is sometimes just handheld with inability to do anything because it's this mayor who just refuses to do anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1914.245s">Now</a> the best part about this most recent election, hopefully you got a wake up call. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1918.806s">from</a> someone who was brand new running for office and got almost 36% of the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1922.908s">That's</a> a wake-up call. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1924.089s">He's</a> got to start listening to what's going on out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1926.731s">Councilor</a> Camuso, you brought up a good point about maybe consolidating the commissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1930.433s">But</a> before we get to the idea of consolidating or eliminating any of these commissions, look at all the people that are sitting there with terms that have been expired for months, if not years. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1939.578s">That</a> needs to be reviewed first. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1941.281s">Why</a> would somebody be sitting on a board that's been expired for months and years and you're worried about whether they're even capable of doing the job or consolidating or merging them? <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1949.993s">I</a> think it's a good resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1952.377s">I</a> think the unfortunate part, one correction to Councilor Langel. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1955.11s">It</a> was two years, not one year. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1956.931s">Counsel</a> Mark said on that traffic commission report, it was submitted in September, October of 2009, and this is now 2011, so two years after the fact, and the mayor is yet to act on that traffic commission report. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1970.84s">You</a> have traffic supervisors on the street right now being told that they're gonna lose their benefits because they don't work enough hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1978.125s">So</a> we're gonna figure out a way how to give you more hours to work it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1982.308s">Maybe</a> the game plan, they're going to be the new traffic enforcement division. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1985.89s">I</a> don't know, but you know that's going to stir apart with the unions around here. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1989.832s">You</a> know, it's very hard to make a conversation come to a life where everybody can understand what's going on, especially the folks who might be watching and the audience that's here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=1998.976s">There's</a> absolutely no communication coming from this administration on these particular issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2003.618s">And</a> I guarantee you, this issue, this resolution wouldn't even be on the agenda if the concerns that have been expressed by taxpayers, when a phone call is made to City Hall, <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2012.57s">as</a> a resolution that I have on later on tonight, from over a year ago, has yet to be responded to. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2018.034s">That's</a> frustration. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2019.675s">That</a> is frustration from taxpayers who are paying their taxes in this city for simple little things. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2025.079s">If</a> you can't accomplish it right away, at least return the phone call. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2028.601s">Let</a> the taxpayer know that they've been acknowledged. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2031.423s">So</a> I support it, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2033.705s">I</a> think it's a good resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2035.286s">I</a> think in whole the council supports it. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2037.447s">It's</a> just a matter of fact that, you know, when is the mayor gonna wake up and understand <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2041.386s">that</a> these resolutions all revolve around the taxpayers of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2044.913s">It's</a> not about any one of us, singularly or collectively. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2047.638s">It's</a> about the taxpayers within this community who pay the bills every single day, every single week. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2052.407s">And</a> that's what this is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2054.383s">Well,</a> you might have your agenda, Dr. Wood, and I know it's the green line that you're impassioned about. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2058.827s">I</a> don't think there's any one member on this council at any point in time that does not have the public safety at heart of the people in this community, whether it's a crosswalk, a sign, a policeman, speeding, fire, public safety, public works, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2074.199s">That's</a> one thing I don't think you can take away from this city council, because that's been our public priority since I think all seven of us have served on this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2082.065s">On</a> the motion for approval, I'd like to speak
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2440.797s">dates,</a> the dates of expiration.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2537.332s">Mr.</a> President, um, some weeks ago, a young gentleman who's sitting out in the audience right now, Mr. Capucci came and brought an issue before us, which was called agenda 21. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2546.695s">It's</a> a very, depending how you view it, <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2549.538s">It</a> either can be complex, or it can be very simple, or it's cut and dry, depending on how you view it. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2554.4s">To</a> me, I find this to be somewhat complex, because the ingredients that make up Agenda 21 have a spillover effect, and that also, unfortunately, spills over into the whole educational philosophy of what Agenda 21 is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2569.027s">The</a> IB program, the International Baccalaureate Program, it's hard to pronounce that.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2575.29s">Baccalaureate</a> Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2577.367s">It's</a> something that started back in 1968 and it came out of, it was a result of a United Nations type of activity where they were looking at the idea of where are we going as United Nations and how are we going to get our agendas, so to speak, better understood throughout the world, throughout the world and the world economy. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2602.969s">And</a> as a result of that, <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2605.467s">I</a> mean, I've just spent oodles and oodles of times and hours getting this thing, trying to understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2610.249s">Because</a> what I want to understand is after Agenda 21, I have been inundated with phone calls with people for and against Agenda 21. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2618.553s">And</a> then these phone calls have now diverted themselves to the educational school system here in the city of Medford, be it public or private, but leaning more toward the public school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2630.418s">And</a> if in fact, or does in fact, the public school <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2633.992s">officially</a> or unofficially participate in any of the programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2637.235s">And</a> to some degree, I would have to assume it would, because some of the things that are in the budget for which the city of Medford pays for, for which the Medford city council votes on and approves as part of this international, um, baccalaureate, what'd you call it? <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2650.785s">Baccalaureate.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2651.405s">Baccalaureate</a> program. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2652.786s">But</a> anyway, <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2654.492s">It</a> started off in the beginning years as a secondary level high school type of a level program. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2661.036s">It's</a> now got itself down from the third grade all the way up to the 12th grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2664.638s">Strike</a> that from three years old up to a 12-year-old person. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2668.0s">And</a> it's recognized it's a non-governmental activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2672.143s">And</a> its recognition is that it's not an advanced placement. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2676.766s">It's</a> not an AP program. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2678.687s">And</a> by not being an AP program, colleges are not accepting any of these classes or any of these courses. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2684.205s">that</a> unfortunately, or fortunately, depending on whether you're a supporter or a non-supporter of the program, takes place. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2690.79s">I'm</a> going to just quote some of the terminology that they use. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2693.933s">It</a> is basically, it's a transformation system of education, instructed to change the attitudes, values, beliefs, and behavior of the student <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2702.656s">to</a> conform to the world government system. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2705.177s">So</a> if you watch anything about what the United Nations is all about, and part of their whole effort is to bring a world agenda together, and if this world agenda together is actually going to be successful, it has to go through an educational process, not a military or a political process, it's an educational process. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2724.965s">Most</a> recently, the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2725.905s">Department</a> of Education established a $1.2 million grant program <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2730.544s">for</a> middle schools that are willing to participate in this program, which become feeder schools for the high schools throughout the entire country. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2737.426s">And</a> as a result of that, the programming consists of six questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2741.568s">Who</a> we are, where are we in place and time, how do we express ourselves, how does the world work, how do we organize ourselves, sharing the planet. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2751.951s">These</a> are the six themes that basically make up this whole idea of the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2756.833s">And</a> as a result of that, <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2758.357s">In</a> 2004, the Washington Times reported the following, that the America's foundational principles of national sovereignty, national law, and inalienable rights are at odds with the IB curriculum, and they're not being taught as such.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2782.723s">I</a> think I just got through saying that, number one, the Washington Times reported in the newspaper article <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2788.975s">My</a> other report comes from Newsweek. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2793.978s">It</a> also comes from Britannica, Encyclopedia Britannica. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2799.502s">It</a> also comes from people who are well established. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2802.083s">It</a> comes from the United States Department of Education. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2804.405s">Where</a> do you want me to stop? <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2807.426s">I'll</a> stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2808.787s">Are</a> you questioning the authenticity of what I'm saying? <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2812.79s">I</a> hope you're not, Councilor, because this is a very serious program. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2817.032s">And</a> if the program is operating here in the city of Medford, we are paying for it in part, whether you realize it or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2823.536s">And</a> that's what I'm trying to find out. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2825.438s">And</a> as a Councilor, I'm trying to find out how this budget works and what incorporates itself into the taxpayers of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2831.582s">It's</a> an important issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2833.505s">So</a> if you want to question me, go ahead and question me all you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2836.508s">Everything</a> I have here is verified. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2838.849s">Aren't</a> we have somebody from the school department here? <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2841.211s">Well,</a> my agenda at the end will be asking a joint meeting, because there are many parents that would like to have a meeting with the school committee and the council, because they don't feel they're getting satisfaction from the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2852.341s">Continuing</a> on, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2855.963s">You</a> know, I just want to say something. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2859.206s">Of</a> all the things that this council is going to get itself involved in, <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2863.063s">whether</a> you want to call it a school department issue or a city issue, there is nothing that's more valuable than making sure that the kids in this community are getting an education that talks about, that talks about whether it's in their social studies, their sciences, or their math, that they are individuals, and their rights as individuals are protected, and they should not be taught that they have to live as a world society person. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2893.739s">There's</a> nothing wrong with looking out for your fellow man, but there is something wrong when they tell you you have to share your wealth and everything that you've earned to take care of people that are in other countries that are impoverished. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2906.967s">That's</a> why we have our freedom of choices to make our donations whenever and whoever we want to make it to. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2912.511s">The</a> United Nations is ongoing right now, trying to do between now and the year 2020, they're going to be down in Africa, <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2921.232s">at</a> a convention on November 28th, well it's already yesterday, to raise $100 billion a year to fight air pollution for which they want the United States to be the prime mover on because we are the richest country in the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2936.876s">But</a> that's not the way for us to spend our money and we shouldn't be told by people in the United Nations or 40 other countries <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2945.548s">We</a> became successful for one reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2947.769s">We</a> worked at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2948.61s">We</a> used our brain. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2950.071s">That's</a> what we teach our kids in school to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2952.352s">Use</a> your brain. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2953.833s">And</a> if you use your brain to become successful, then your intellect as an individual will surface and rise. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2959.977s">But</a> if you want to go to this group world attitude that we have to think of ourselves globally as an individual and share whatever we have globally as an individual, we have now dumbed down upon ourselves and relegated ourselves <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2974.566s">to</a> the same third world opportunities, or lack thereof, that those countries don't have. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2979.329s">They</a> can have the same world opportunities, they just need to get themselves and their political right of way, so to speak, in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2987.074s">We</a> did it some 243 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2989.879s">And</a> look what's trying to happen right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=2991.18s">They're</a> trying to have, through the United Nations, couched this IB program to take away everything that our servicemen that we go and celebrate every Memorial Day and Veterans Day died for. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3003.514s">The</a> individual rights of freedom, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3007.678s">not</a> globally to take away your right of religion, to take away your right of making a living, and to take away the fact that you have to take care of the rest of the world because unfortunately your parents or grandparents made it for you and you've succeeded upon that. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3022.264s">That's</a> not what we're all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3024.405s">We're</a> all about a country, a group of citizens whose family and parents emigrated here, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3031.748s">You</a> detoured me. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3032.608s">You</a> did a good job of it, but I'm glad I got it out because I'm gonna finish what I have to say, Councilor Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3038.786s">More</a> importantly, Mr. President, partnerships. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3042.65s">They</a> talk about working in partnerships. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3045.053s">Well,</a> you can be partners with anybody you want politically or socially. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3049.377s">And</a> if you want to put a child in a classroom to be a partner with the student next to him, that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3053.802s">I'll</a> leave the name of the school, and I'll leave the name of the teacher, and I'll leave the name of the class that's out. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3059.603s">But</a> there's a program that's being distributed right now and implemented in one of our schools that talks about the fact that you should share that for what you have, which is your wealth and your right to have things that other kids and other families and other people don't have. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3075.798s">That's</a> okay to learn as a learning process, but don't indoctrinate a child at that age who has never, ever gone through the process <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3084.368s">of</a> knowing what the difference is between right and wrong, because this is when they're their most, this is when they're their most informative. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3091.832s">This</a> is when their mind and their imagination takes place. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3094.253s">And</a> if this is all that they're hearing, that's what they're gonna grow up to think and believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3098.135s">And</a> where does that put us in future 10 or 20 or 30 years as a country? <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3102.117s">It</a> takes away everything that we stand for. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3104.678s">Our</a> ability to stand alone, to be alone, and be that individual that our parents told us and taught us to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3113.003s">Mr.</a> President, <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3115.48s">We</a> have in our public school system here, Medford is part of a $9.5 million National Science Foundation and it's called TERG, it's the other part of the Medford Public School math program for which unfortunately is causing a problem with some parents who believe that the program is not satisfying or completing the child and the MCAS scores and grades like they're supposed to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3144.474s">At</a> the elementary school level, the worst of the National Science Foundation funded programs is widely used in the K through five series. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3153.819s">The</a> program relies heavily on calculators and does not include textbooks in the usual sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3160.282s">And</a> as a result of that, there are parents who have addressed this issue before the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3165.025s">And</a> the school committee, through some of their members, leaving them nameless, just do not want to address it or accept that for which the parents are talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3173.418s">We</a> are part of that $9.5 million programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3176.72s">And</a> therefore, Mr. President, it's well within our daily work to talk about it, and it's well within the school committee's department to talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3183.803s">You're</a> talking about the kids within this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3186.865s">Also,</a> Mr. President.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3188.626s">Point</a> of information, Vice President Del Russo.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3213.083s">From</a> my understanding and speaking with parents, they have addressed this to the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3217.865s">Certain</a> individuals in the school committee, they have not responded in a like manner of concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3225.336s">Has</a> it been before the school committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3226.838s">Yes,</a> people have addressed it before the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3229.42s">As</a> a matter of fact, one of the issues that were addressed before the school committee some two to three weeks ago was the fact that the school committee might be considering taking algebra out of the eighth grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3238.89s">I</a> mean, these are one of the prerequisites for children to go to college if they want, if they want to be math folks, they want to succeed. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3245.993s">If</a> you start taking away some of these programs, once again, it goes to this whole IB program.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3254.416s">Where</a> are the principals in this? <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3256.817s">I</a> can't answer that, other than the fact that parents are now starting to bring this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3261.818s">And</a> I want to thank Mr. Cappucci for bringing this thing up a few weeks ago, because this whole thing with Agenda 21, it's more than land, and it's more than smart growth, and it's more than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3271.341s">It's</a> the whole educational philosophy. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3273.514s">And</a> if this thing gets itself entrenched into the minds of these students, as I just said a few minutes ago, they're gonna know nothing different. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3279.235s">They're</a> not gonna know what we knew growing up. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3282.436s">Let</a> me ask you this from the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3283.456s">If</a> it's so nefarious. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3285.416s">I</a> didn't say it's nefarious, no.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3288.057s">Your</a> inference is bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3289.457s">No,</a> my inference is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3292.097s">Let</a> me get to finishing what I'm gonna say. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3293.658s">Finish</a> what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3294.318s">Go</a> ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3295.698s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3298.418s">There's</a> a critical review which comes out of Texas, the place where the <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3302.235s">It's</a> called We the People, the Citizens, and the Constitution. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3306.558s">It's</a> a civic textbook written by the place in Texas that writes the textbooks for the entire country. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3311.621s">And</a> what they are doing, they are being taught that in the United States, number one, we are the number one terrorist nation. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3317.725s">That's</a> what it says. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3318.785s">And</a> they are being taught that the rest of the world is mired in poverty because of the greedy capitalists in the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3325.87s">That's</a> what these kids are being taught. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3327.791s">That's</a> what's in these textbooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3330.092s">Point</a> of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3331.837s">What</a> textbooks have that? <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3333.718s">These</a> are the history books that are coming out of Texas, which serve the entire country. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3337.341s">When</a> we buy our textbooks, the civics. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3340.243s">This</a> is already in print. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3341.804s">It's</a> already in print. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3343.545s">They</a> are in our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3344.406s">I</a> can't tell you, it's in this school, but if it's coming in this school, it's in print and it's ready to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3349.669s">These</a> are the new textbooks that are now being printed and ready to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3352.812s">Who's</a> the publisher?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3364.74s">Well,</a> it's not that it's Marxism. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3367.022s">Let</a> me just go on. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3368.823s">The</a> United Nations Global Education Program took a major step in 1968 when they started this whole programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3378.229s">And</a> it basically said we're living on a planet that is becoming exhausted. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3382.171s">A</a> guy by the name of George Walker wrote this. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3385.133s">He</a> is the director in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3386.734s">He</a> comes out of Geneva, Switzerland. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3388.656s">And</a> he says that the program remains committed to changing children's values so they think globally, <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3394.098s">rather</a> than in parochial national terms from their own country's viewpoint, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3400.7s">Mr.</a> President, the IB program has been dropped. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3405.021s">550</a> schools have picked it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3407.341s">74</a> of the high schools that have picked it up have now dropped it because they have seen what it's done everywhere from California to Rhode Island. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3414.863s">The</a> goals and the methods of the IB program reach much further than the 502 U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3419.664s">schools</a> now officially enrolled. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3421.345s">The</a> Center for Civic Education, <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3423.401s">which</a> by law writes the curriculum for civics education in the United States, says, quote, in the past century, the civic mission of schools was education for democracy and a sovereign state. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3436.009s">In</a> this century, by contrast, education will become everywhere more global, and we ought to improve our curricular frameworks and standards for a world transformed by globally accepted and internationally transcendent principles. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3450.539s">The</a> global influence can be clearly seen <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3452.716s">in</a> the new mission for the National Curriculum Standards for Social Studies. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3456.218s">This</a> is the national curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3457.519s">This</a> comes right out of the United States government. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3459.92s">This</a> is their philosophy, which is now gonna be transcended into their new books.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3467.825s">I</a> don't know if we have the new books yet.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3471.307s">The</a> International Baccalaureate's philosophy? <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3473.409s">No,</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3474.329s">What</a> I just read to you comes from the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3477.111s">It's</a> in Washington. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3477.931s">They</a> print the civics books for the entire country.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3483.771s">Well,</a> that's part of the argument, and I'm not saying that it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3487.033s">The</a> whole idea of bringing this to the attention of everyone, I want to find out if in fact, what if in fact our Methodist public school systems are involved with this, if anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3498.779s">The</a> idea of an automatic cutoff. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3500.881s">The</a> United States cut off its financing because the United Nations decided to give money to Pakistan. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3509.14s">And</a> the argument in rebuttal by certain legislators and congressmen is that we should be cutting off this type of IB information being disseminated through schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3518.306s">Now</a> remember, as I told you before, the IB information is something, if I understand this correctly, it's something that does not garner college graduate credits or college accepted credits. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3528.954s">So</a> it takes away from the AP programs if kids are taking this. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3532.238s">with</a> the 502 schools that have already accepted and the 74 that have opted out, they've opted out because they found out what this programming entails, which basically allegedly is diminishing the value of the individual and making the individual feel that he or she needs to transform their way of thinking globally. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3551.883s">The</a> question then becomes, if you read <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3555.14s">Read</a> what they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3556.381s">Their</a> whole program is revolved around environmental, multicultural, and citizen global world agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3563.526s">That's</a> their agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3565.367s">This</a> isn't my agenda, this is their agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3567.989s">And</a> my question that needs to be asked, and through the Medford Public Schools system, are they in fact participating in any shape, manner, or form? <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3576.054s">We</a> accepted this in 1999, September 2nd, 1999. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3580.536s">The</a> city of Medford accepted this. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3582.116s">Mayor</a> McGlynn signed off on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3583.677s">And</a> at that point in time, none of us probably had any idea what it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3587.519s">And</a> if you signed off on it and you're a participant, they pay you. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3591.1s">Anyway,</a> it's up to $135,000 a year to be a member in this particular program. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3595.361s">And</a> if you are and you're getting inundated or indoctrinated with that type of philosophy, that can cause a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3601.142s">Whether</a> it's the sciences that talk about believing and worshiping the earth, or whether it's the multiculturalism and believing that we should be a hyphenated society of one, or whether it's the extreme belief that we should be echo green for everything because that's gonna save the world, <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3618.766s">There's</a> more to the educational process than those three agendas, and that's the concern that I have, and I believe that's the concern that's been translated to me from folks, and I hope I've said it somewhat clear, but I think I've got the point out that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3633.084s">I</a> think we need to have a review of what the Medford public school system <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3637.729s">has</a> in their civic books, what are they teaching in their sciences, in their social studies? <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3642.592s">Does</a> it follow any of this philosophy of the United Nations IB program? <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3647.116s">And</a> if it does, I think it needs to be reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3649.637s">When</a> parents bring these up to the school committee, as they did some two to three weeks ago, and they're ignored, or it's not what you're saying it is, you can't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3657.783s">I</a> mean, last week was the best example. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3659.484s">We</a> had people come up here who for months and months and months complained about George and Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3663.387s">They</a> finally came here, the council heard it, and it got itself corrected. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3667.191s">This</a> is a multiplying issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3669.332s">This</a> is so recent as of today in California. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3673.854s">It's</a> a big issue, and the issue is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3677.415s">Are</a> and is the United States gonna conform to the wishes of the United Nations, whether it's their political or their educational agendas, and if it's an educational agenda, how is that gonna reflect upon we as a country? <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3690.481s">Keeping</a> our sovereignty, keeping our nationality, and keeping our individuality. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3694.829s">because</a> those three things they do not teach. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3697.251s">And</a> if they take that away from the kids that are being taught, then they've taken away everything that this country stands for. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=3703.076s">Thank</a> you.

<a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=4968.428s">If</a> you don't know anything about Thomas Sowell, read up on him. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=4970.889s">He's</a> another one, Jim Moss. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=4972.97s">He's</a> well known, he's well respected from Stanford University. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=4975.831s">Writes</a> in the column, he's syndicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=4979.973s">This</a> is not an attempt to scare anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=4982.954s">As</a> I said, I've spent all week on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=4986.876s">Trying</a> to get my head revolved around the fact, if we get ourselves to the middle of the road in this, what is the value of the program if in fact, <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=4996.782s">It</a> is operating here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=4999.627s">Are</a> they paying us for it? <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5002.091s">And</a> what are the programs that are being taught under it? <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5005.517s">And</a> if some of the programs or if any of these programs are being taught under it. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5010.404s">that</a> take away the individuality, the right of religion, the right of free speech is already in this program, because it's obvious, it's in 500 schools throughout the country, so that's not the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5020.051s">And</a> as a lot of these quotes from a lot of these folks will say in some of these schools, and I went into all 74 of the districts, and all 74 of those districts, the end results from the parents that met, they were sold a bill of goods, they really didn't check into it, they didn't really get into the whole thing, until the subject matter was taught. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5037.244s">And</a> this is where we're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5039.005s">The</a> subject matter has to be taught in the school system for someone to understand this is what it's all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5044.087s">The</a> philosophy has to be spread. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5046.088s">It</a> has to be taught. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5047.368s">The</a> kids have to bring it home before the parents finally get to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5050.55s">You</a> know, they're hitting, as I told you before, they're hitting the brightest children at their weakest time and age because they just don't really know how and where this government came from before it all started. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5061.074s">So</a> if they're being indoctrinated or entrenched with this type of philosophy, <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5065.628s">through</a> education, not through politics, smart way to go to education, they're not going to know the true values that we talk about and they're not going to know the real values of why and what our veterans have died for over and through the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5078.421s">You</a> know, if we decide to become a world citizen and become that collaborative, become that collective and not become we as one, <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5089.098s">then</a> we have basically lost this whole idea of why do we send our children to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5094.099s">You</a> know, I'm not a fan of corporate greed, and I think I have stated that on a couple of occasions when I have given my Memorial Day address. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5101.361s">But</a> the corporate greed that I'm talking about is how it maneuvers itself through Washington through the legislative process, not how it's taking America and making it a third world country, so to speak, by making it become global. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5118.618s">And</a> that's what's gonna happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5119.999s">So,</a> anyone who might be watching, if you just wanna send me some more information, I'd be happy to. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5126.362s">What</a> I would like to do, Mr. President and Councilors, I would like to call for a roll call, no, strike that, I want a roll call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5132.065s">I'd</a> like to call for a joint meeting with our school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5134.866s">I'd</a> like to announce it to any and all parents throughout the city of Medford that have children in the public school, whatever your concerns might be on any of these issues that have an IB attitude or an overview, to bring it, and let's address it, <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5147.365s">You</a> know, I think even between and amongst ourselves, we're probably not gonna grasp some of these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5154.657s">What</a> happened? <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5156.64s">Tree</a> fell. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5159.579s">We're</a> not going to be able to grasp these issues right away, but then again, you might because some of these social studies issues are very succinct. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5168.622s">But</a> as I alluded to in the beginning, we do participate in a math program for which part of the money has come from the Commonwealth of Mass, part of a grant, and that in and of itself presents a concern because it's part of the national science. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5184.108s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to move the question.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5619.891s">Uh,</a> counsel Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5621.352s">Well,</a> Mr. President, uh, first of all, before we got to the joint meeting, I would want that joint meeting to be prefaced by the fact of what a report back from the superintendent and his director of curriculum are, is the city of Medford officially or unofficially partaking in any of the UNIB programming and does the city of Medford participate in the receipt of any monies for many of these programs? <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5642.704s">And</a> does in fact the city of Medford participate in a math program, <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5647.478s">That</a> basically is part of the National Science Foundation and the TREC program. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5652.942s">And</a> if that's the case, Mr. President, you know, these are leading principals that are going to get this. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5658.566s">So</a> when we have our discussion with the superintendent and the school committee and the directors of curriculum, let me just say this to clear it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5668.15s">You</a> say you're not going to have a meeting because you don't have enough information. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5671.093s">I've</a> heard that before. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5672.615s">When</a> are you ever going to have enough information? <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5674.697s">The</a> whole idea of bringing the information forward is to go to the next step. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5678.321s">They'll</a> have enough time to get their act together, whether the programming is taking place or isn't taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5684.398s">And</a> I hear what you're saying, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5686.259s">It's</a> a school committee issue if it was a school committee issue, but it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5689.741s">It's</a> before this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5690.902s">We</a> vote on the entire budget, which also includes the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5694.384s">And</a> if the school committee is not satisfactorily answering the questions of parents and taxpayers, and they have to broach councils with it, <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5702.189s">I</a> being one of them, that I'm bringing it forward because this revolves not around the education, this revolves around the life of an individual who doesn't have a chance to grow up and understand, understand what and how this country got to where it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5716.381s">He</a> or she is being told that she globally has to become part of a conglomerate, a conglomerate, <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5720.725s">a</a> collective whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5722.267s">And</a> she's losing that sense, or he's losing that sense of being the individual with a brain that God gave him to use. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5728.692s">Not</a> to share everything he has with people less fortunate because that's the guilt that this whole programming, if that's what it's all about, is trying to devise. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5737.781s">It's</a> not gonna take place overnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5739.302s">it's</a> gonna take place over a period of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5741.543s">As</a> I said, you may have spent 100 hours, I'm reading it, I have some concerns, some questions, but my real concern is if in fact we are to any degree, and Mrs. Benedetto, she's on there, and I'm glad she's here, and I compliment her for being here, because that's how serious she is about her job. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5755.748s">Well</a> then if there's a smidge of it taking place, then that's what's gotta go, the smidge that's in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5759.85s">Because</a> it doesn't speak well for the Medford public school system, if in fact it's in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5764.913s">Now</a> if it's not in there, and as Councilor Dello Russo has alluded to, I heard that we don't have civics anymore and this and that, we can get into this whole issue of what is being taught in behalf of the welfare and the education of the kids in our school. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5776.919s">Why</a> maybe is algebra gonna be taken away out of the eighth grade? <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5780.341s">I</a> mean these are all quality courses to make kids become a better person. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5784.203s">to</a> become a better person in society for his life. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5787.364s">In</a> this country, in the United States of America, not in a third world nation, not to support some other underprivileged country that can't make it on its own, but the guilt trying to make we in this country pay for everyone else's either mistakes or inability to go forward because they haven't gotten to that point yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5805.129s">And</a> if we relegate ourselves to that position in life and to this world, we might as well hang up 234 years <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5811.171s">43</a> years of what we were, because we won't even last another 25 years at the rate we're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5816.113s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=5816.713s">Councilwoman,</a> go current.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6646.236s">Mr.</a> President, once again, for 58 years, I have the opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6649.783s">to</a> go and watch the Medford High School game on Thanksgiving Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6654.929s">The</a> boys did a great job, the band did a great job when they were allowed to play, and the cheerleaders did a great job when they were heard, or seen, let's put it that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6669.008s">It's</a> just unfortunate that it's the game of the year that everybody waits for. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6673.65s">The</a> boys had a great year. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6675.531s">They</a> worked their hearts out. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6677.352s">Didn't</a> make any difference whether you won or you lost. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6679.653s">It's</a> Thanksgiving Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6681.233s">It's</a> a teenage game. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6682.834s">It's</a> a game for kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6683.874s">It's</a> a high school game. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6685.655s">It's</a> not a game for the Patriots or professional football. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6688.836s">And</a> the sad part about the whole thing, Mr. President, a band who waits all year long to play a big game of the year, never have the opportunity to play. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6697.992s">They</a> were drowned out by some crazy music that kept playing over and over and over again during the course of the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6703.478s">And</a> it just really made no sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6705.741s">And</a> I think it was just a complete insult to the whole football day activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6712.128s">The</a> kids worked their hearts out to play, tried to win. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6715.912s">The</a> band <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6717.795s">waited</a> for this day to make sure that they have that opportunity to do at least their halftime presentation, completely drowned out. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6726.343s">The</a> only time you actually heard them was at the end of the fourth quarter. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6729.906s">And</a> then the cheerleaders, it's unfortunate, Mr. President, everything that you would normally go to see on Thanksgiving Day just didn't make it. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6736.793s">I</a> don't know who's responsible, who's in charge, but I would hope the message goes back loud and clear that this does not happen next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6744.415s">This</a> is a game for the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6745.455s">This</a> is not about professional football and acting and playing like it and playing the same music they play in Foxborough. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6751.417s">Who</a> cares about that? <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6752.877s">This</a> is a kid's game and it's the game of the year that everybody waits to go for and to see and watch. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6759.398s">But</a> let me underscore all of that by saying they played their hearts out this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6763.9s">It's</a> just, <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6766.243s">Maybe</a> it's just a tough business being in football, a lot like it was years ago, but it's neither here or there. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6771.988s">The</a> coach and the team did a great job, the cheerleaders did a great job, and the band, they did a great job under the circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6778.675s">But</a> putting that aside, Mr. President, I would expect that something is done and this does not happen again because it just took away from the whole <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6788.101s">The</a> whole excitement of the day, waiting for the halftime, waiting for the band to play, waiting to see the cheerleaders and do what they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6795.203s">And</a> they were just drowned out by that crazy, stupid music. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6798.684s">That's</a> no other way to explain it, because that's what it was.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6922.415s">You</a> know, they have a, they have a band director too. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6924.896s">And</a> you just jog my memory. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6926.237s">You</a> go and you have the dinner the night before these kids get all prepped up. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6929.199s">The</a> band gets all excited. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6931.177s">How</a> does this happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6932.357s">And</a> then when you go to find out and you ask the question as you were there, nobody know who everybody was blaming everyone else for doing whatever it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6938.819s">There</a> was absolutely no coordination on that football game for how the activities were supposed to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6943.38s">It's</a> a shame. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6944.64s">It</a> really is a shame.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6970.555s">Mr.</a> President, I had the opportunity this morning to watch <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6973.873s">a</a> Medford policeman on detail for almost two hours, walk every single person with the baby carriage, student, person going to the hillside, hardware, anyone trying to walk across that street, because the blinking lights weren't working. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6987.926s">The</a> big one wasn't working, the one right there at the corner of Boston Avenue and Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6993.471s">A</a> lady came into the store, the policeman brought her over to me, he says, there's the Councilor, you tell him. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=6998.511s">She</a> told me she called that guy's office over that hall over a year ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7002.033s">Nobody</a> has ever done anything about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7003.574s">She's</a> just thoroughly disgusted with state government. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7006.296s">Strike</a> that, with city government. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7007.777s">And</a> she says, but you know, the policeman was very nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7009.858s">He</a> brought me over. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7010.839s">And</a> she seemed like a very nice person. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7013.34s">This,</a> again, <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7014.857s">It's</a> an issue, Mr. President, that should be resolved tomorrow morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7017.338s">The</a> same way they took care of Winthrop Street in George Street, they should go right up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7021.781s">You've</a> been up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7022.421s">You've</a> seen it in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7023.842s">You've</a> got speeding cars up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7025.823s">You</a> have people driving through red lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7027.964s">You</a> have people that don't park eight feet away from the intersection. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7031.026s">You</a> have traffic lights that don't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7032.887s">You</a> have streets that don't get striped. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7035.588s">So,</a> Mr. President, if this is just part of this collective activity, <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7039.39s">the</a> council can do, I think tomorrow morning, the mayor should go up there post haste and fix that light. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7044.612s">Fix</a> those lights, that four-way intersection. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7047.173s">Because</a> you can't have a policeman there every day directing traffic, he just happened to be there because of a detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7051.996s">And</a> he should be complimented. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7053.276s">He</a> walked every single person. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7055.097s">He</a> didn't stop the cars, he walked them from one side of the street to the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7059.539s">Get</a> the name of the police officer? <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7061.02s">No,</a> I don't want to embarrass him because he knows who he is. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7063.041s">I</a> told him I wouldn't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7064.401s">He</a> should just be complimented, and he was for doing his job, period, that's what he said.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7222.466s">I</a> know you're calling for Committee of the Whole meeting next Tuesday, but I think we really need to have a committee meeting on the school technology part of it because we are a part of that component to give our opinions and to forward them before any finalization comes in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7237.05s">So</a> I would hope that you call it within the next two weeks.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7262.15s">No,</a> no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7263.031s">I</a> believe if we, you were there at the mayor's press conference, he said he was going to be waiting to get input from the community, from the school committee and the city council, and then once he has all that together, then he would be making his recommendation.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7279.909s">Well,</a> take it from the table, then. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7280.97s">Move</a> to take it from the table.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7293.26s">So</a> keeping in concert, Mr. President, with the mayor's request that the school committee, the council, the technology committee, and any other citizen, quote, any other citizen who wants to give their input, <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7303.289s">I</a> just think we should. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7304.51s">The</a> mayor's requested this meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7306.832s">The</a> mayor stated in his press release on a Friday afternoon, the ones that only certain councils were invited to, that he would be making a request for $2 million at some point in time in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7319.902s">But</a> that would be subject to change upon review by the school committee, the city council, the technology committee, and any citizen or group of citizens who want to give input. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7328.969s">So</a> I believe the city council has an opportunity to give its input.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7352.209s">You</a> have the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7353.511s">You</a> have the report that was given to each councilor, and take that report and add a subtract to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7359.075s">That's</a> what the revision's going to be.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7369.423s">In</a> two weeks.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7453.399s">Mr.</a> President?
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7455.3s">Mayor,</a> as quoted from the day the press release took place, Mayor McGlynn said the plan is subject to change based upon public input and the approval of the school committee and the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7464.569s">The</a> technology upgrade should begin before the school year is over and is considered phase one of the upgrade. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7470.654s">What</a> we're talking about is what's in this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7473.477s">It's</a> a voluminous report.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7477.718s">I've</a> read both reports too. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7478.678s">The</a> paper to go to the Committee of the Whole is for what purpose? <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7481.26s">The</a> purpose to discuss, discuss that which is before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7485.002s">If</a> in fact we are going to accept any part of it to discuss, are we going to, listen, are you going to wait for someone to turn around and say, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7491.607s">I'm</a> asking you a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7492.707s">I'm</a> giving you an answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7493.708s">Will</a> you wait a minute? <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7495.629s">What</a> is it with you tonight? <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7497.377s">No,</a> it's what's with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7498.157s">Calm</a> down. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7498.357s">There's</a> nothing wrong with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7499.617s">Just</a> give me an answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7500.418s">Yeah,</a> your answer's very simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7501.878s">Are</a> we gonna discuss refurbished computers or new furthers? <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7504.758s">Are</a> we gonna talk about leasing them or are we gonna talk about buying them? <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7507.559s">That's</a> what's in the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7509.119s">And</a> once the city council gives this recommendation, once the school committee gives this recommendation, once the technology committee gives this recommendation, then the mayor will give his recommendation.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7571.759s">But</a> you can't give approvals, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7574.522s">This</a> isn't just coming up with money for a bond. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7577.806s">This</a> is coming up with, number one, you're going to do the infrastructure first. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7580.929s">And</a> I would assume as a group of level-headed individuals, we'd be looking at the proposal and indicate, well, if we go to <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7587.864s">the</a> infrastructure, we'll do the infrastructure for us, because you have to have that before you go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7593.045s">And</a> then if the next phase, excuse me, if the next phase is, are we gonna buy new or used, and let's make that decision, and then however you get to that decision, are you gonna have the one-for-one programming? <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7602.608s">And</a> if you're gonna have the one-for-one program, is it gonna be in the lab, or is it gonna be in a cart that takes it away from one class to another the next day that has the same one-for-one programming? <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7611.41s">And</a> we can go on and on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7612.651s">Are</a> we gonna go out and seek outside vendors, or are we gonna take the ones that are already in the proposal? <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7617.857s">If</a> you read it and you have it all broken down, you'd have your, all your questions ready to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7621.241s">And</a> at least we'd have some kind of uniform way of going. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7624.344s">Then</a> the mayor can do whatever he wants for 2 million, 3 million, $4 million and plug it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7628.128s">You</a> see where it goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7629.65s">My</a> suggestion is, is there a chairperson of this committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7632.293s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7658.445s">So</a> like I said, I just don't want to step on their toes. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7663.846s">We</a> also have, Mr. President, another part of this component. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7666.587s">And</a> the other part of this component, while we're talking about the school department, the resolution entails entirely the entire community. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7672.408s">It</a> talks about municipal building, the police, and the fire, and the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7677.169s">So</a> if we're going to do it, we're not going to piecemeal it. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7679.61s">Let's</a> find out where in this wonderful world of a mind that the mayor has how he figures to put this all together. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7685.951s">That's</a> all. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7686.531s">If</a> we're going to talk about it, let's talk about the big picture, not the small little picture.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7698.016s">There's</a> no chairman listed by name. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7699.517s">It's</a> just 24 members. <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7700.637s">So</a> no one's identified as a chairperson.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7706.76s">Well,</a> he's the first name on there.
 <p>[Robert Penta]: <a href="https://youtu.be/flE_htIV76U&t=7712.201s">Mr.</a> President?
